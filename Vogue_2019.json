Teodoro", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "If he hadn\u2019t chosen a career in fashion, Albino Teodoro would have become an architect; this explains his penchant for sculpted, neat shapes with a couture-ish flair. Not surprisingly, his favorite designer is Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga, who had a sublime talent for sumptuously unadorned silhouettes. At the opposite side of the designer\u2019s inspiration spectrum is couturier Jean Patou\u2019s quintessentially French style: feminine, seductive, a bit frivolous. Teodoro blended the two influences into Pre-Fall. \u201cI worked on simple shapes,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I added a touch of sensuality and a youthful spirit, as if a girl were playing a grown-up woman.\u201d Fine-tuning Balenciaga-inspired contoured lines and softer feminine accents was actually an exercise that Teodoro handled rather smoothly. Cases in point were Prince of Wales\u2013checked trapeze coats cut with precision, their round donut-shaped collars lined in a graceful shade of pale pink. In the same vein, a short cape-dress in black double cashmere had an elegant, sculptural flair yet looked fresh worn with bare legs and high-heeled pumps. A lover of interior decoration and antique wallpapers, Teodoro found an archival William Morris\u2013inspired floral pattern that he translated into the iris-print motifs gracing elongated feminine dresses and dusters in fluid crepe de Chine. A sensuous, frivolous feel was highlighted in the ruched sleeves of a see-through blouse in black plumetis. But the Balenciaga-esque severity somehow kept creeping in; a strict tailored suit was cut in a dry, stiff, grid-printed cotton call Vatican canvas, which is actually used for priests\u2019 cassocks."}, {"Designer": "A.L.C.", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Andrea Lieberman just solved the riddle of how to wear a pantsuit on 85-degree days: She whipped hers up in ultra-light, ultra-crisp cotton poplin. For women like Lieberman, who prefer easy yet sharp-looking summer clothes to the season\u2019s ubiquitous boho dresses, her paper-thin blazers and belted trousers will feel like something of a revelation. And in case they still sound business-y, consider how Lieberman styled them: A black cotton suit was paired with a heavy metal\u2013inspired California Love T-shirt, the proceeds of which will benefit relief efforts for the state\u2019s recent wildfires, and a deconstructed suit consisting of a baby blue poplin blazer and khaki trousers was styled with a stretchy knit tank. Oh, and both were shown with flat sandals. It doesn\u2019t get much easier than that. Designing those kinds of easy yet polished pieces is Lieberman\u2019s m.o. Also in the mix: asymmetrical dresses in crinkly emerald viscose or python-printed silk, tie-dyed cotton sweaters, leather shorts, and sleek jumpsuits. She applied the same airy cotton of the suits to another unexpected category: eveningwear. The opening look was a one-shoulder cut-out gown in crisp, weightless black poplin, and it might just be the coolest wedding-guest dress of the season. "}, {"Designer": "A.W.A.K.E. MODE", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Natalia Alaverdian is a dynamo with a magpie imagination and a penchant for quirk. Her collections are usually layered with so many references, it\u2019s almost the antithesis of what they teach in fashion schools\u2014i.e., \u201ctake one reference and stick to it.\u201d Coherent, cohesive, orderly, and rational aren\u2019t the adjectives to describe the A.W.A.K.E. label. For Pre-Fall, Alaverdian put into her fashion percolator the clean minimalism of the \u201990s\u2014or, as she explained cryptically, \u201c\u201990s minimal businesswear slightly screwed up.\u201d Then there\u2019s her Scottish Highlander/Wuthering Heights/Victorian\u2013tinged romanticism and beloved Japanese deconstruction, which keep coming back no matter what. \u201cI didn\u2019t intentionally go for it, so I don\u2019t know. It just comes through and I\u2019m, \u2018Oh, hello again!\u2019\u201d she quipped. Apparently, trying to find in her collections one significant theme is just a moot point, so better to read them as the instinctive cut-and-paste creative processes they are. Pre-Fall was redolent of a bevy of \u201990s-extracted elements; detecting influences from Helmut Lang, Romeo Gigli, and the Japanese designers of that time was a no-brainer. They were apparent in the slim-cut silhouette of pencil skirts and cut-out stretchy tops; in the absence of decorations and embellishments; and in the streamlined sexy vibe of tight black vinyl skirts worn with open-back, ruched cotton tops or with heart-shaped d\u00e9colletages. Asymmetrical details also pointed in that direction, as in a high-waisted sunray-pleated circle skirt paired with an oversize blouse, or with a one-shouldered shirt worn backward. For evening, Alaverdian took a less conceptualized approach; the results were unusually dressy by her standards. A romantic motif in black and white was printed on a long apron dress with trapeze-cut pliss\u00e9 paneling at the back, while a fluid silhouette made an appearance via a glamorous long pleated dress in shimmering silver. \u201cIt has a kind of \u201970s vibe, as well, a bit Halston and Lauren Hutton here and there,\u201d noted Alaverdian."}, {"Designer": "Adam Lippes", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Adam Lippes visited the Tangier home of interior designer Roberto Peregalli this summer and was instantly smitten. Its poetic mix of textures, deep colors, and time periods were on his mind as he worked on his vivid Pre-Fall collection, which ranged from a boyish cotton jumpsuit to a Met Gala\u2013worthy double chiffon long dress, without a wrong note. The centerpiece of the new lineup is an electric abstract photo print of which Studio Peregalli would surely approve. Lippes photographed a bouquet by Putnam & Putnam\u2014his go-to florist\u2014on expired 35-millimeter film and used the best blurry shot, printing it small on a narrow double silk skirt and blown up on a weightless techno fabric trench. The woman who wears them will be unmissable, but color was exuberant throughout. Most memorable: the warm shade of reddish copper he used for a smocked off-the-shoulder taffeta dress in an easy silhouette that will have his customers ordering in multiples (it\u2019s also available in black). The same hue turned up on a dress with thin shoulder straps and a swingy trapeze volume\u2014another summery winner\u2014as well as on a long, lean pant suit in a cotton-wool blend that reminded the designer of his youthful Brooks Brothers suits. Lippes is expanding his tailoring repertoire. Of note beyond the suiting were the flattering paperbag-waist pants that he showed in black leather and a dark-wash Japanese denim. Also interesting on the more casual side of the offering was a chunky cardigan in a cozy shade of brown with mink pockets upcycled from vintage fur coats. From one end to the other, spot on.

It might sound pompous to put that label on a collection of raunchy-sexy-cool workoutwear, but Selman has built this business to work on every level. All of the stretch pieces are made of recycled materials. Everything ships out in eco-friendly packaging. The size range accommodates many types of bodies, sizes 00 to 20, and a new series of rainbow-rhinestoned sport tops and leggings will benefit House Lives Matter, an organization that approaches problems like HIV/AIDS and social justice issues affecting the ballroom community\u2014so these sports bras and leggings really deliver a message. But do they deliver on the style front, too? Well, let\u2019s say this: It\u2019s practically impossible to thumb through a rack of fluro bike shorts with French-cut seaming and not smile\u2014even harder if you\u2019re actually wearing the shorts. Cheeriness and cheekiness are Selman\u2019s bread and butter, and thank heavens he is bringing that irreverence to the activewear market, which has so long been about ruggedness and regimens. For his second collection, he is elaborating on the silhouettes he introduced earlier this year\u2014push-up sports bras, leggings, nylon windbreakers, and a bandeau crystal dress\u2014while bringing new patterns and colors into the mix. A scattered rose print is about as lovely as it gets; the rest of the collection is made up of in-your-face neons and crystals. Needless to say, this isn\u2019t workoutwear for wallflowers; they can buy their dusty pink leggings elsewhere.

In fashion, however, despite the fact that many labels are focused on upping their Instagram footprints or selling clothes with the help of a digital avatar, precious handmade things are au courant again. Sure, there are luxury brands like Balenciaga and Maison Margiela pushing the future-is-now agenda, but consumers seem to be drawn to the finer details of a non-machine-made garment these days. Designer Hanako Maeda has always appreciated and utilized the handcrafted in her work. When she launched her label Adeam in 2013, Maeda set out to design clothes that showcased functionality and Japanese artisanship, and to sell those clothes at a not-so-astronomical price point. Her latest outing is a sort of greatest hits album, one that showcases her love for shirting, convertible clothing, the mix of masculine and feminine silhouettes, and nods to the kawaii (cute in Japanese) aesthetic. There are pretty tiny bow embellishments on the sleeves of a button-down made with water-resistant gingham, a ruffled obi-style belt that can cinch the waist of a boxy jacket, and sharply tailored bustier dresses. A plaid dress with tied sleeves is reversible, as is a cool denim ruffled top. Every piece is made in Maeda\u2019s Tokyo atelier using fabrics like Japanese crepe and a synthetic material that feels as light as linen but won\u2019t wrinkle. As a whole, Adeam offers a digestible, practical version of the handcrafted fashion phenomenon. Maeda isn\u2019t asking anyone to shut down their social media pages or to stop shopping online but, rather, to buy beautiful clothes that are made for humans, by humans; this collection is proof of the allure of that simple notion. "}, {"Designer": "Ala\u00efa", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Like the previous season, this Pre-Fall offering encompasses three ranges: a collection of new pieces that feel close to Monsieur Ala\u00efa\u2019s vision, the \u00c9dition archive capsule, and \u00c9ditions Limit\u00e9es, which is positioned as demi-couture and available only by appointment. In these images, once again lensed by Karim Sadli and styled with utmost precision by Joe McKenna, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to identify the differences, although hard-core Ala\u00efa aficionados might enjoy the challenge. To be sure, this coherence is a good thing; you get the sense the maison is moving on by staying true to what made it so desirable for decades. And judging solely by the level of activity in the Paris showroom at the end of couture week, interest remains enthusiastic. As buyers were clustered at tables placing their orders, models with dancer-like poise gave form to key looks. These included a jacket with rounded shoulders, a nipped waist, and basque that laced up the front, corset-style (flawlessly constructed, if not the easiest to put on and take off); a black dress with a scalloped teacup skirt; and knit pieces covered in a rhythmic loop of micro studs. There were other signs of knit newness, namely a dimensional origami design that stood out for its elaborate paneling structure, and a high-contrast animal stripe that gave off strong graphic impact. There were investment pieces aplenty: a leather coat patterned with metal grommets (revived from the Hiver \u201987 collection), the grouping of fluid silk looks that gave the impression of leather, and a belted coat dress in ribbed velvet. And the laced stiletto boots\u2014every bit femme fatale\u2014couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, what with sneaker fatigue now kicking in. It\u2019s worth noting that the selection here represents a rather tight edit of the showroom offering, where the full range of bags and shoes were on view, in addition to three body-skimming \u00c9ditions Limit\u00e9es dresses (here\u2019s hoping one ends up on the red carpet; they were gorgeous). Apparently, their openwork and beading, in the same looping motif as mentioned above, took hundreds of hours of handwork. By comparison, many of the \u00c9dition pieces registered as everyday wearable\u2014a blue velvet shirt from \u201983 or a top with signature Ala\u00efa contouring from \u201985, for example\u2014but no doubt required hours of effort to create anew."}, {"Designer": "Alberta Ferretti", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Alberta Ferretti is a dynamic, pragmatic woman; she knows rather well that women are challenged enough in their everyday lives without having to also be challenged by their wardrobes. That\u2019s why she has cleverly adapted her collections to our fast-paced reality, expanding an efficient daywear offering and injecting her style\u2019s ethereal femininity with a spirit of youthful energy. But make no mistake: She\u2019s not running after millennials. \u201cYouth for me is a state of mind,\u201d she said. She has surely embraced a utilitarian sporty direction, yet she did it her way, with an elevated approach, rich in decorative details and rather elaborate. Streetwear isn\u2019t a word that\u2019s included in her vocabulary; she\u2019s even a little critical about it. \u201cI\u2019d like to bring fashion to the street, rather than bring the street into fashion,\u201d she explained. For Pre-Fall Ferretti continued to broaden her daywear horizons. The jacket was the collection\u2019s pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, offered in different iterations: masculine with a fitted waist; loose and comfortable like a sweater; elongated to the point of becoming a dress. It was often paired with sporty high-waisted pants in soft leather or in stonewashed jeans cut elliptically along the leg to widen its proportions. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make things difficult for high street copycats!\u201d she said, pointing out a gorgeous oversize crocheted knit sweater, elaborately embroidered by hand with abstract motifs. Not easy to replicate, surely. Outerwear came with an imaginative flair, as in a brown waterproof moleskin peacoat hybridized with a cape. Paired with high-waisted canvas trousers and a matching quilted waistcoat, it looked practical yet inventive. On the same dynamic note, dresses were feminine, svelte, and short, sometimes with crisp, romantic blouses worn underneath. Eveningwear had the same spirited attitude. Embellishments weren\u2019t much indulged, save for a luminous straight-cut minidress embroidered all over with lozenge-shaped silver sequins. It looked pretty cool."}, {"Designer": "Alejandra Alonso Rojas", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Things are popping for Alejandra Alonso Rojas professionally and personally. The designer, who decided to drop Spring in favor of showing three times a year so she could better focus on her strengths (read: knits, leathers, and handwork), shot her first Pre-Fall collection in the pop-up stop she opened a few weeks ago on White Street. The store has been such a success that she\u2019s extended the lease. As if that weren\u2019t enough to cheer about, below the designer\u2019s flowing Botticelli curls sits a beautiful baby bump. Rojas is a designer who remains faithful to her core silhouettes, evolving them to suit the season. Lightness\u2014and layerability\u2014were her aims for this collection, one that had a fresh languor. There were many riffs on bias-cut slip dressing, and variations on side-draped skirts, which were offered in trailing maxi lengths. Similarly, touch-the-ground pants extended to high waists. These might be paired with crochet-and-knit midriff sweaters, or combined with a bra top and a structured single-breasted blazer, worn open for a \u201cpower\u201d look. Adding texture to the lineup was a Mariano Fortuny\u2013inspired pliss\u00e9 that Rojas plans to add to her arsenal long-term. \u201cI think the micro pleating that is very stretchy was a little bit inspired by my pregnancy,\u201d she said. Color is central to this designer\u2019s process, and she\u2019s known for developing her own tints and fabrics. The atelier, says Rojas, became a veritable lab for Pre-Fall as she and the team employed turmeric, blackberries, indigo, red cabbage, and flowers to create hand-treated textiles, like lengths of ombre-yellows and a whispery petal print. The palette was inspired by the landscapes of Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla and the Rose and Blue periods of Pablo Picasso. Pinned to Rojas\u2019s mood board, next to photos of her mother and abuela, was Picasso\u2019s Maternit\u00e9, depicting a nursing mother. (This was even before Rojas knew she was expecting.) For this designer, circularity is everything; each collection starts and ends with her family and her Spanish roots.

Four countries bolted together (for the moment) as one, near equally inhabited by Remainers and Leavers, it\u2019s a nation united by disunity. For this Pre-Fall collection Sarah Burton and her team looked to England\u2019s north\u2014eternally polarized against England\u2019s south\u2014to build a collection of clothes that strikingly combined a collage of contrasting regional elements into an innovative and harmonious whole. Burton, a Maxonian, counts as a bona fide northerner and the north-sourced ingredients she rallied here were broader than the outstanding rose-strewn, tailoring-focused (and furthering) Fall collection. Here, the cut crystals threaded upon a sleeveless house-shouldered tailored jacket and strung along the surface of layered lace and tulle dresses were nods to the grandiose chandeliers of Blackpool\u2019s great gilded ballrooms. The occasional crystal on multi-buttoned cardigan or spike-toed loafers were imagined as earrings lost in a particularly passionate cha-cha-cha. That jacket and almost every other in the collection were cut with a low skirt, a semi-peaked lapel, and a single button, then placed above triple-pleated peg-leg pants to muster a silhouette meant as tribute to the Neo-Edwardian style of northern 1950s teddy girls. Some of the suits came in a silk-printed rip-edged photo collage of rose images, both as tribute to those evergreen floral symbols of the north\u2014Lancashire v. York\u2014and the album art of Factory Records. The rose motif rambled through the collection, reappearing as embroideries on jackets or metallic relief on powdery pink, nylon-shot silk jacquard suits and a deconstructed bodice top with side skirt. A washed silk duchesse dress in the collage print featured a Victorian bustle back (as a nod to the Bront\u00ebs) with a tulle-pumped, exploded couture-style sleeve (back to the ballroom), while a long white waffle cotton shirtdress referenced the made-in-Manchester suffragette movement. At the end of the rail, evening suits featured painstakingly assembled sequin portraits of cormorants, one of the symbols of Liverpool. This McQueen collection was a soulfully northern exercise in comparison, collision, and ultimate integration that will find an audience way beyond the boundaries of its reference."}, {"Designer": "Andrew Gn", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Andrew Gn prefaced this showroom visit by saying he had named his Pre-Fall collection Tiramisu, even though the coffee-drenched dessert was unrelated to the designs. \u201cIt brings joy and happiness,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn these times, who wouldn\u2019t want a pick-me-up?\u201d Of course, the pleasure of tiramisu lasts only until the final spoonful, whereas one of Gn\u2019s new suit jackets in mauve or teal could be enjoyed for years. He noted how including tailored pieces was important to him this season\u2014not just as a juxtaposition to his usual ladylike dresses, but as a stand-alone statement reflecting his appreciation for detail. Shoulders, for instance, had been constructed with horsehair canvas as traditionally done on Savile Row. And the colors were not insignificant, even if they seemed limiting. You need only consider Kate Middleton or various female politicians to know that an allover color statement can signal controlled expression. But Gn will always have a penchant for pretty prints, and some from this season came with a personal story. The designer\u2019s father, when traveling for work, would bring his mother fabrics from places including Indonesia and Japan, which she would have made into dresses. Finding some of these back in Singapore, Gn reimagined them as his own creations, which ranged in style from elevated-bohemian to princess-worthy. Cut sharp and slim, the brocade suit was a fine r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the collection; but more important, it could look fantastic for a formal function if ever gown fatigue sets in. It was a pleasure to see Gn proudly showing off a duo motif of pears and butterflies (spot the caterpillar holes in the leaves!) that were hand-painted in house and placed on even more dress variations, some trimmed with glinting floral embroideries or passementerie.

He recently collaborated with a historic Italian publishing company for an exhibition where he transformed 16 Zanichelli dictionaries (the Italian version of Merriam-Webster) into one-of-a-kind artworks, each dedicated to a famous woman. It was obviously a metaphorical take on the role played by culture in the definition of female identity, which in Marras\u2019s elliptical narrative became the subtext for his Pre-Fall collection, hyperbolically called Well-Read Women Are Scary. To add further layers of meaning, Marras worked around the idea of double identities for the collection\u2019s lookbook, enlisting as models two professional dancer-actresses with whom he collaborated on a theatrical piece he wrote that premiered in 2017. \u201cThe shooting session was actually more like a spontaneous performance; it was truly exhilarating,\u201d said the designer. A rich tapestry found in a decadent old British country house was the decorative thread that held together imaginative patchworks and mash-ups made from multiple fabrications and textures. Some of them\u2014masculine pin-striped wools, floral jacquard brocades, wool chenilles, tartans, and lacquered lace\u2014were upcycled from previous collections. They were translated into classic masculine shapes, a tad strict and severe but inventive, or otherwise into more generous, sporty volumes. To counterbalance that restraint, elongated velvet tunics and floral-appliqu\u00e9 tulle dresses with pliss\u00e9 inserts were charming alternatives. The subtle palette of grays and beiges, gently lit by touches of lam\u00e9, had a romantic, almost pensive flair, well-suited, it would seem, to cultivated, bookish types. \u201cI dress women who love to read,\u201d mused Marras.

But athletic references have been sneaking into their recent collections; Spring introduced their take on a tracksuit, and for Pre-Fall, Cramer and Hout reimagined some of their greatest hits in a soft, leisurely sweatshirt material. A balloon-sleeved, ruffle-neck blouse was whipped up in sage cotton, complete with ribbed cuffs and a half-zip where the button placket used to be. The Apiece Apart woman will throw it on with jeans for a day of errands. It wasn\u2019t really sports that inspired those pieces (though they did say the denim shorts were a riff on a pair of Patagonia Baggies). Hout and Cramer were thinking more about their customers\u2019 increasingly busy lives and their need for comfortable, no-brainer items that don\u2019t look sloppy. Easier said than done! Their strength is in filling those gray areas: The multi-print cotton and habutai dresses looked casual enough to wear during the day, but they\u2019re special enough for a wedding, too. Similarly, their best-selling canvas pants have a rugged, utilitarian vibe, but with a pinched waist and flared legs, they\u2019re oddly sexy. The designers may have even introduced their first bona fide (but still low-key) wedding dress, or at least a dress you could wear to the rehearsal or morning-after brunch: an ivory cotton organza gown with a wide portrait neckline, fully embroidered with tonal flowers.

Unlike the stuff we\u2019ve been seeing on the runways this month, Pre-Fall\u2019s clothes tend to be of the breezy, uncomplicated variety\u2014the kind of stuff you want to wear on a balmy 90-degree afternoon. That straightforward ease and no-brainer wearability are where Arj\u00e9\u2019s Bessie and Oliver Corral really shine, so the see-now-buy-now paradigm works well for them. Their new linen suits, poplin shirtdresses, and georgette blouses aren\u2019t items you need six months to screenshot and pine after; they\u2019re pieces you rush to scoop up on the first day of summer, with zero chance of buyer\u2019s remorse.

Pre-Fall, which just became available in the label\u2019s Wooster Street store and on Net-a-Porter, includes subtle twists on Arj\u00e9 classics: Their silk button-downs come with crochet trim, for instance, and they spun their double-breasted suits in a luminous linen-silk blend. There is genuine newness, too: The flowy silk dresses are the most \u201cconventionally\u201d feminine pieces the couple has designed (nearly everything is intended to be unisex), and for a brand that tends to avoid prints, the rack of striped cotton and linen pieces is a surprise. The warm palette of beige, sand, blush, and brick red lends a vaguely Mediterranean vibe to all of those natural materials, and Bessie confirmed they\u2019d been thinking about iconic films set on the Italian coast, namely The Talented Mr. Ripley (which turns 20 this year) and Call Me By Your Name (destined to be referenced for just as long). While the former takes place in the \u201950s and the latter is a vision of the early \u201980s, it\u2019s easy to picture characters from both films wearing the linen button-downs and slim trousers\u2014both appropriately rumpled, with the sleeves and cuffs rolled up just so."}, {"Designer": "ATM Anthony Thomas Melillo", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Anthony Melillo has the luxury of wearing sweatpants to the office.

It\u2019d be nice to see the designers, now that their collection\u2019s execution has been clearly upgraded, hit the fast-forward button on their imaginative approach in a more confident, assertive way."}, {"Designer": "Badgley Mischka", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "The Badgley Mischka woman is changing. \u201cShe\u2019s no longer content to sacrifice comfort for style,\u201d shared Mark Badgley during a visit to the brand\u2019s atelier. \u201cNo matter the occasion, she still wants to feel comfortable.\u201d That desire for ease was reflected in Badgley Mischka\u2019s seasonal outlook after a fairly bombastic 30th-anniversary collection in September; Pre-Fall with its extended shelf-life and accessible nature called for a fresh direction. Though the duo kept their signatures\u2014bold embellishment and refined shapes\u2014they offered them in new fabrications that focused on movement and lightness. A classic suit-dress in royal blue fit for Meghan Markle and her ilk was delivered in sporty scuba fabric that hugged the body, as did an array of cocktail looks and gowns. Stretchy striped dresses with criss-cross details added a bit of playfulness to the mix, while bejeweled necklines decked with sequins, miniature flowers, and embroidery provided a decadent final touch. Even with the relaxed vibe, the duo couldn\u2019t resist adding in a few looks where the message was about glamour. An emerald satin gown with a draped back was gala-worthy, as were sequin-laden striped pieces and a pair of appealing dresses on which magnolia blossoms featured prominently. Displayed at the Miles McEnery Gallery, the embellished pieces popped alongside artwork by Tom LaDuke and Monique van Genderen.

For the showroom visit, Bui readied some of the pieces that guys will be able to buy later this year: polished coats in camel and houndstooth; sportier outerwear including a luxe aviator jacket and duffle coat; and her signature slim leather pants, sized accordingly. Wearing these pieces in the lookbook, a male model exudes good attitude\u2014as does the female model who, unsurprisingly, can also be found in going-out looks that remain true to Bui\u2019s chic stylings. If the way she summed up this new exercise gave pause\u2014\u201cThe design is both masculine and feminine, or else neither masculine nor feminine\u201d\u2014 there was nothing ambiguous about her \u201ccouture arty\u201d references. Drawing from ska and the \u201980s fashions of designers like Emanuel Ungaro yielded dresses in tiers of high-contrast polka dots (especially those in orange and blue), or blocked in black and white; houndstooth boots that would be fun to wear from time to time; and a few cape-like tops that were an all-in-one statement. With the haute Parisian angle such a natural fit for Bui, it was nice to also see some variety in the argyle grouping, which included a great patchwork of leather and denim, and graphic pattern-blocking, namely a cool quilted jacket. She said that designing men\u2019s helped give strength to the women\u2019s wardrobe, and it appears this was the case."}, {"Designer": "Batsheva", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "In Batsheva\u2019s Pre-Fall 2019 lookbook, designer Batsheva Hay\u2019s clashing-print frocks, smocks, and tunics transform Coco Rocha into characters and caricatures of herself. In one photo she\u2019s framed by a fan of legs in black tights and stilettos. In another she\u2019s in the bodega with a bowl cut and pinafore. In a third, Rocha has an enormous head and tiny body, somewhere between a Downsizing version of herself and a Bratz doll. On the surface it might seem like more of the same from Hay, but with this collection the designer is taking the Batsheva brand to new places. Having participated in the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund and dressed celebrities from Natalie Portman to Mandy Moore this year, Hay has begun to evaluate of the realities of her business. Her Pre-Fall collection is thus merchandised in orderly groups to appeal to retailers and also introduces new silhouettes and separates. The first section is composed of childish printed pieces in custom \u201970s-tinged patterns. There\u2019s a cute tent dress with contrast floral prints and a button closure on the shoulder; a vaguely \u201940s skirt suit with a flared hem and peplum top; and a trompe l\u2019oeil smock dress in Raggedy Ann gingham and swirly florals. There are even pants. Hay, who mostly adheres to Orthodox Jewish mandates of dress, has begun to think about modesty outside her own religion\u2014Muslim women often wear pants under abayas; shouldn\u2019t they have the option to do so in a red tiny-dot print? Elsewhere, Hay expands on these shapes but in solid colors intended to clash: peach with egg blue, wine with forest green, coral and icky brown. The last group in rich jewel-tone velvets and leopard prints is arguably the most mainstream of Hay\u2019s offering. It would be inaccurate to call these pieces practical, at least compared to jeans and T-shirts, but they do represent a streamlined, function-driven approach from Batsheva. For the woman adverse to blending in, these will be a fantastic reality."}, {"Designer": "Blumarine", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Blumarine had its heyday in the \u201990s, when its advertising campaigns were shot by the likes of Helmut Newton and Albert Watson, and all the supermodels of the era, from Linda Evangelista to Carla Bruni, glamorously strutted down its catwalks. One of the label\u2019s most beloved muses of that time was the actress Ornella Muti. For Pre-Fall, Muti was rescued from oblivion to reprise her Blumarine role. Muti\u2019s ingenue sensuality was referenced in ice-blue Chantilly lace shirtdresses with contrasting black trimmings, worn with retro black stockings or thigh-high leather boots. Blumarine\u2019s romantic floral femininity received a kicky update, as in a sumptuous bustier ball gown in silk cady with an asymmetrical wisteria-printed skirt; paired with a matching cardigan featuring a blue mink collar, it made for a bold evening proposition. On a more vintage-bohemian note, a \u201970s-inspired, slightly Yves Saint Laurent\u2013ish pliss\u00e9 dress was cut from zebra-printed blue silk lam\u00e9. The same animalier motif in a bright shade of cobalt graced a tuxedo-jumpsuit hybrid, which would be a convincing evening outfit for a pretty young thing. Daywear was svelte and colorful, with short wrap coats in Technicolor tweed or robe coats in houndstooth-printed eco-fur in eye-popping hues of bubblegum pink and fuchsia. There were mini versions of those eco-furs in the kids\u2019 line that will delight mommy-and-me types."}, {"Designer": "Bottega Veneta", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Before we start, let\u2019s do the introductions: Ladies and gentlemen, this is Daniel Lee, whom you might call a known-unknown, a 32-year-old English designer who came to Bottega Veneta from Celine in July, replacing Tomas Maier. It\u2019s the Celine part of Lee\u2019s provenance that is salient\u2014if that\u2019s the right word\u2014to the frisson of anticipation about him felt by the legions of women who are still living with post\u2013Phoebe Philo fashion disenfranchisement. Could this prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the great woman have learned her touch, her rigor, her practicality, and her covert wit? Or\u2014since goodness knows, there are quadrillions of duplicated Philo-Celine clothes in the world\u2014will Lee strike out and do something uniquely his own? That\u2019s a lot of expectation to put on the shoulders of a young designer, and Lee must certainly feel it. He didn\u2019t seem thrown by it, though, as he walked around the showroom where his first Pre-Fall women\u2019s, men\u2019s, and accessories collections were being given a soft launch before the Fall runway. The first words from his mouth were reassuringly down-to-earth and uplifting at the same time: \u201cI like real clothes. I think there\u2019s a need for a return to elegance and sophistication.\u201d He said he has been looking about the streets of Milan and thinking about how Italian women dress. \u201cI started thinking about film stars like Monica Vitti, and about modern women like Franca and Carla Sozzani.\u201d Lee has lived in New York, London, and Paris since he graduated in the class of 2011 from Central Saint Martins\u2019s M.A. degree course, the fashion boot camp then run by the late professor Louise Wilson (where two of his peers were the designers behind Marques\u2019Almeida). This is his first job in Italy\u2014and his first viewpoint on the culture of northern Italian dress codes, which is home territory well-patrolled by Prada, Max Mara, Salvatore Ferragamo, Ermenegildo Zegna, et al. What can be new? A temptation for an outsider might be to fall into over-reverent pastiche or satire. But at first impression, there was something refreshingly modern and respectful, without being timid, in Lee\u2019s treatment of the canon of black blazers, beige overcoats, silk blouses, gold jewelry, and pumps. \u201cI like structure,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be quality\u2014well, I came from somewhere that had great fabrics. And, of course, I\u2019ve had to think about leather. Bottega Veneta is based on leather.\u201d A tailored black jacket had a scoop neckline carved out with a raw edge and artily beaten gold buttons. A camel coat had a deep silk \u201clining\u201d sleeve cuff and a \u201chandkerchief square\u201d detail transferred from the inside of a man\u2019s pocket. There were fluid, golden caramel blouses and well-cut pants. The sort of clever, low-intervention details\u2014like the knotted straps on a set of satin slip dresses\u2014that turn the wearable generic into something quirkily desirable. If anything can be gleaned of character from a pre-collection, some of the echoes in this one seemed to place Lee among his fashion generation\u2019s loves. There was a touch of Martin Margiela and Helmut Lang, and even a hint of Tom Ford\u2019s \u201990s Gucci years (satin blouses, slinky black jersey dresses). The menswear, Lee said, \u201cis just what I like to wear!\u201d And besides the suiting, considerably more sporty than the women\u2019s. There were leather jackets with articulated elbows and motocross sweatpants with articulated knees. Oversize gray double-face cashmere shirts did the job of replacing tailored jackets. The tour ended with the accessories. Lee had taken the jewel in the crown of Bottega\u2014the famous woven leather intrecciato technique\u2014and supersized it. \u201cI exploded it,\u201d he said, laughing. Result: The chunky pattern will look distinctive from across a street. As will the curiously bulbous square-toe pumps and boots, also latticeworked in leather. A bright turquoise pair of ankle boots had all the head-turning vibrancy of an It thing of the season. Is this a star-is-born scenario? A Philo replacement in the making? Too soon to call. When women walk in the Fall show in February, we\u2019ll see more. But from what was in evidence in this showroom, after only a couple of months\u2019 work, there are substantial, well-made clothes here that would make a customer want to reach for them in a shop. And just enough borderline ridiculousness in the accessories to turn that bourgeois look into proper fashion fun.

Kristopher and Laura Brock have a way with bustier dresses and peplum cocktail frocks, and they tick the right boxes: They\u2019re editorially interesting, but have real-world appeal to a variety or women, too. It\u2019s easy to spot the Brocks\u2019 influence in department stores and high-street chains (consider the prevalence of antique florals, puff sleeves, and underwire details), and women as disparate as Emily Ratajkowski and Elle Fanning rely on their dresses for red carpet events. With that in mind, the Brocks could probably manage an entire business of dresses alone. (And, indeed, women have been asking the Brocks for wedding gowns and bridesmaids dresses.) But they\u2019re up for a bigger challenge\u2014so for Pre-Fall, their focus shifted to tailoring. They introduced an elegant, longline boucl\u00e9 coat in ivory or bright lavender with full, gently rounded sleeves and a moveable button at the center, so you can cinch it tight or wear it a bit looser. It filled the just-right gray area between a cozy, casual robe coat and a fancy evening piece. There were several hip-length, unlined tweed jackets, too, which felt new not just for the Brocks, but for the market in general; in a sea of oversize blazers, a soft, collarless jacket looks fresh. That focus on tailoring inevitably begged the question of a pantsuit. The Brocks\u2019 version came in brick-red gingham with a shirt jacket in lieu of a more formal peak-lapel blazer. Diehard fans will layer the jacket over a floral jacquard dress, but the full look\u2014seen here with matching checked trousers\u2014will speak to a whole new kind of Brock woman.

Where there used to be massive digital screens playing shows and campaign videos in the vast foyer of the company headquarters on London\u2019s Horseferry Road, now the walls are covered with the remastered retro-style TB logo print Tisci commissioned from Peter Saville. Everyone who pays attention to fashion can bring that pattern to mind\u2014internationally ubiquitous\u2014yet it was only revealed this past summer. Such is the accepted speed of things now. With his second collection\u2014the clothes you see here\u2014Tisci says he was concentrating on consolidating the message he laid out in his extensive debut show, i.e., generational inclusivity. Coming on the heels of the Burberry \u201cfamily\u201d holiday commercial\u2014seen through Juno Calypso\u2019s slightly surreal filter\u2014Tisci reiterated his original mantra about the brand being for mother and daughter, father and son. Mostly, he\u2019s pulled it all together by not straying far from the classic Burberry palette of beige, white, red, and black. Yet that\u2019s a lot of people to try to appeal to, all at the same time. Perhaps it\u2019s easiest to start with the men. Anyone with an idea of how Tisci himself likes to dress will immediately see his personal stamp all over the T-shirt and baggy shorts looks, including one in a dark navy plaid\u2013pattern fleece. Young menswear, famously, is a growing category, and one that Burberry aims to own with such rethinks of matching \u201csuits\u201d as the duffle coat, sweatshirt, and shorts, all made in gray jersey knit. In womenswear there\u2019s more gloss than athleisure. Variations on the trenchcoat abound, notably a fluid, drapey one, worn over wide pants, and another that is more like a sleeveless, tailored coatdress, with one of the season\u2019s innovations on top\u2014a soft padded wrap-shawl, printed with the Burberry logo. That\u2019s an accessory Tisci enlarges on further for the hip \u201cgirl\u201d\u2014iterations made in silk scarf prints, held on the shoulders with a diagonal strap.

By breaking the myth that elegance has to be uptight.\u201d Wes Gordon took the reins at Carolina Herrera less than a year ago, but he gives quotes like a seasoned pro. His Pre-Fall collection exudes a certain confidence, too. Under his leadership, the Herrera vocabulary is expanding; the signature flamboyance is present, but he\u2019s also making room for a surprising new sense of minimalism. Take, for example, a peacock green silk wool pantsuit. In the past, the jacket might\u2019ve come with three-quarter sleeves, the shape trim and cropped; now, the silhouette is ultra-streamlined, the only curving lines at the slightly accentuated hips. Gordon gave the atelier\u2019s expert tailor, who happens to be a woman, credit for the suit, as well as for a dramatic to-the-floor black tuxedo dress and a shorter tuxedo dress in sapphire with an exuberant bow at the waist and flamingo pink lining. With tailoring trending elsewhere in the market, those were three smart developments. Not all of the innovations came across quite as well. The crystal embroidery decorating cotton shirtdresses seemed a bit unlikely. But that was a small thing, and in general, Gordon\u2019s approach was well considered. On the more flamboyant side of the story, he pointed out a ruffled bustier in that same shade of flamingo pink. It was as effortlessly constructed as possible, where it once would\u2019ve been heavily boned. The evening offering was characterized by a weightless insouciance that felt youthful and modern, from a silver paillette-strewn ivory tulle T-shirt dress to what Gordon described as a \u201cgoddess nun\u201d robe in sweeping black and white chiffon."}, {"Designer": "Chalayan", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cThe theme this season is pretension. Pretension can be the product of imagination, something that takes you to other realms. But the word is often used in a pejorative way, especially about class. I wanted to look at it in a true way.\u201d So said Hussein Chalayan at the shoot for this Pre-Fall installment of the three-parter that will run on to menswear and then womenswear Fall 2019. In addition to unpacking the notion of pretension, this collection was about picking apart the word itself: inserting a hyphen between pre and tension to give extra emphasis to his long-refined flourishes of structural virtuosity in the extra ribbons of material that floated down sleeves or the flying buttresses of panel overlaid on seam-reduced skirts and dresses. The thematic nodes of pretension that Chalayan interrogated included Hyacinth Bucket\u2013ish (British reference alert) bourgeois aspiration via overprinted tree jacquards meant to reflect uppity wallpaper, strapping details and flashes of pleather shine that hinted at fetish and role-play, and mumsy check double-faced cashmere outerwear and classic tailoring shapes that cantered through equestrian territory. Apart from his constantly provocative personal codes of architecture\u2014really, nobody else builds clothes like Chalayan\u2014the surprising parts of this collection came when he toyed with the boundaries of taste that his theme allowed him to explore: A wallpaper botanical overlaid over an Aztec-ish zigzag on a pair of full pants was both difficult to look at and impossible not to. This theme will develop over the next two collections, but already it feels ripe with uncomfortably interesting potential.

She gets where her base is coming from. \u201cI think what\u2019s interesting about femininity is that it\u2019s not just one directional. You can say everything and its opposite, maybe sneak in a hidden message,\u201d she said during a recent visit to the Chlo\u00e9 showroom. For her Pre-Fall collection, Ramsay-Levi delivered several variations of soft-meets-strong in a cast of characters that riffed freely on the \u201970s and \u201980s. Reiterations of the Chlo\u00e9 signature bow blouse mingled with directional pieces such as a crushed-velvet apron dress, intricate knits, a lace skirt, and essential Chlo\u00e9 archetypes\u2014the trench, the cape, the duffle, the cable sweater, and so on. Chlo\u00e9\u2019s horsewoman may be heading for Carnaby Street, but compellingly, many looks broke free of the usual comfort-zone, earthy tones: Those flares, for example, were back in amethyst and emerald, perhaps paired with an Edwardian shirt and a tank sweater embroidered with Chlo\u00e9\u2019s rearing steed. They also come recast in a fluid, Persian-inspired teal print that nodded to the wanderlust in Chlo\u00e9\u2019s Spring show, now paired with a carnelian cameo-print scarf blouse and a fitted, \u201970s-style jacquard jacket with an archival C monogram. Tunic dresses dallied with cropped shearling; a button-down Lurex jacquard slipped under the shell of a boxy denim jacket. And with just a few exceptions (the transparent and patchwork numbers come to mind), Ramsay-Levi kept it grounded\u2014intellectually and sartorially\u2014with chunky boots, most winningly in \u201cwave\u201d-heeled embossed croc, although the square-toe loafer style in python print will have its partisans, too. Among other accessories, Chlo\u00e9 unveiled two new handbags: the roomy Aby day bag and the boxy Annie chain-link bag, which join new styles of the Chlo\u00e9 C-clasp bag and camouflage variations of the Tess bag. Elsewhere, the Aluminium jewelry collection expanded on an idea that started with a ring Ramsay-Levi\u2019s 5-year-old son made for her out of aluminum foil. The designer says she likes the idea that when you dress, you layer on information. \u201cWhat goes for summer, goes for fall\u2014the statement is there, but the message doesn\u2019t change.

Her multidisciplinary approach was avant-garde at the time: art and craft coexisting through design. Among Delaunay\u2019s vast body of work was a dress for Christian Dior worn by Fran\u00e7oise Hardy back when Marc Bohan was overseeing the house. Geometric in arrangement, it appears reinterpreted in Chiuri\u2019s Pre-Fall collection, which is distinguished by its subdued yet elaborate artisanal detail. Chiuri motioned over to a mood board featuring various Delaunay references, in addition to work by Anni Albers. Both \u00e9migr\u00e9s, they achieved early success alongside, but also independent of, their acclaimed artist husbands. There was also a photo of Diana Vreeland attending \u201cThe Glory of Russian Costume\u201d exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum in 1976; images of the Ballet Russes performing Igor Stravinsky\u2019s Rite of Spring; and a version of the book cover for The Subversive Stitch: Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine by Rozsika Parker from 1984. Like an erudite patchwork, it explained the earthy sobriety; the folk elements; and the classical dance-inspired dresses that pick up where the Spring collection left off. \u201cI think you come to Dior to find pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter at a high level\u2014creativity with quality,\u201d Chiuri noted. \u201cAll the embroideries and techniques, it can be a very experimental way to make things. And it\u2019s not easy sometimes.\u201d This became clear as she singled out how many of the wearable looks were imbued with layers of workmanship. First, there was a hand-application of color grazing the dark surfaces of shapely outerwear in sturdy Shetland wool\u2014as though the classic Bar jackets had been modernized and air-brushed by street artists. (In fact, the traditional weaving technique is done by women in the Salento region of Italy.) There was delicate lace that revealed a tiling of muted tones beneath; a jacquard of tulle that appears as a gauzy lattice sheath worn by Ruth Bell; crochet intarsia and pleating formed from incrustations of gradient silk; woven tufts of fur and 3-D knits; and embroideries of velvet and beading. If some of the silhouettes seemed noticeably throwback, they were styled in an updated way; frothy dresses worn over second-skin turtlenecks or sheer skirts revealing knee-high boots with sleek embossed accents. Other accessories, meanwhile, played up the personalization: chunky pendant necklaces of zodiac figurines, or bags and belts with a choice of hardware\u2014in lieu of CD, your own initials that fasten into place. It\u2019s a fascinating development; a combined identity that invites you to declare your own brand value. Just when the walkthrough seemed complete, this reviewer realized that one key piece remained unseen: the season\u2019s statement tee which renders The Subversive Stitch in colorful loose threads (harder to reproduce!). Even as Chiuri continues to position Dior with cultural feminist messaging, she remains somewhat conservative in the fashion messaging. The substance is all there; but you do see a painting that is less daring than it is pleasing. ["}, {"Designer": "Christian Siriano", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "If you head to Provence, you\u2019ll find yourself immersed in a world of lavender. The French province is famous for the bloom, and tourists flock to see it growing in a violet wave from the peaks of Mont Ventoux onward. For Christian Siriano, the natural beauty of the region had a lasting effect, one that gave his Pre-Fall collection its bold color palette and theme. Siriano used the shade to great effect, working it into every other look.

The color of kings, queens, and Prince, purple provokes a strong reaction, and Siriano used it to highlight his most daring pieces. Presented on the back of Westworld actress Angela Sarafyan, whom he dressed for this year\u2019s Emmys, the expansive ball gowns and ruffled minidresses work, especially when they veer into over-the-top territory. Bombastic fashion has always been Siriano\u2019s specialty, and the decadence of a dress with three tiers of satin frippery makes sense within his world. Everyday basics without pomp and circumstance provide the greater challenge, but here he offered another first. Polka dots may be standard fare, but it is one motif he\u2019s avoided in the past; this time around he offered a variety, from oversize to barely visible, worked into casual separates as a means of spicing things up. A cream knit blazer dotted with flecks of plum and glossy PVC midi skirts paired with matching boots were nice, but there\u2019s a chance Siriano\u2019s lighthearted customer skips all that for the madcap fun of lavender tulle and crystals."}, {"Designer": "Christian Wijnants", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "American painter Alice Neel was the inspiration behind Christian Wijnants\u2019s Pre-Fall collection; her whimsical color palette and the fresh energy of her brushstrokes appealed to the Belgian designer, whose expressive chromatic sensibility is a distinctive trait. The painterly abstract floral prints that graced a series of dresses and separates were made in-house, referencing the vibrant dynamic of Neel\u2019s aesthetic. Color gave the collection a cohesive quality; bright shades of green, porcelain blue, and purple were offset by white and black touches. Prints and patterns were blended in artsy patchworks, gracing fluid, layered shapes; dresses were cut loose and easy, often with asymmetries emphasizing a dynamic sense of movement. Wijnants also tried his hand at more structured shapes. Tailoring counterbalanced the effortless ease he favors in a series of oversize masculine pantsuits in checked wool with strong shoulders and a straight cut. Worn either with matching palazzo pants or long skirts, they made for a cool proposition.

Instead of taking his audience off on a fantasy resort trip, this one is basically a stay-at-home experience. Albeit one with a lot of surreptitiously naughty fantasy emanating from behind those closed doors. Sexual symbolism and playful perviness have been visibly playing through Kane\u2019s shows since he invoked the suburban Madam Cynthia Payne in Spring 2017. With this one, he\u2019s teased out his obsession with Marilyn Monroe, whose voice he used in a recent catwalk show, saying, \u201cSex is part of nature. I go along with nature.\u201d That\u2019s how he arrived at the Monroe with a kitten print on a pink duchesse satin top\u2014\u201cbecause she was known as an animal lover\u201d\u2014and then a flurry of coded references to \u201950s cliches, from hand-drawn polka dots and boudoir negligees to ladylike pearls. The cleverness in Kane\u2019s collections is how many shades, from chic to simple, they manage to contain without losing continuity or identity. There\u2019s a quite amazing amalgam of a dress that flows down through black lace and a gold chainmail bodice into a gathered satin polka dot skirt. The pearls colonize a white shirt, dripping from the collar and cascading down the front; loops of them trickle onto tailored pantsuits (substituting for the highly successful crystal trimmings he\u2019s been running recently); and fringes swish on toeless pink pumps. It\u2019s that odd glamour, running the gamut from wearable utilitarian everyday pieces to the extreme\u2014a \u201cgrunge\u201d green latex puff-sleeve dress\u2014that keeps things \u201cspecial,\u201d as Kane likes to term it.

Yes, those abstract red and white circles and squares are a reference to the potato, cut in half and dipped in ink to create a geometric print. Li splashed it on long pleated skirts and sheath dresses with a little tie-on apron to suggest an artist\u2019s smock. Smocking of the technical sort appeared diagonally across the front of a comfy sack dress that concealed a clever pocket inside of a cut-out, and there were several strong collared shirts with corset-like boning to create structure. Once more, Li revisited the sportswear references from the past two seasons: coatdresses cinched with paracord and lots of waterproof items. One standout was a long black nylon slip of a dress with an intricately woven black-and-white paracord belt. The fabric contained a hidden print, near invisible to the naked eye.

Following Valentino and Dior Men in Tokyo, Vevers\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s Pre-Fall collections traveled 7,377 miles from New York City to Shanghai, which has become one of Coach\u2019s biggest markets since its launch there in 2003. It\u2019s not just the handbags that do well in China; at a cocktail party on Friday night, CEO Joshua Schulman reported that Coach\u2019s ready-to-wear is booming. How could Vevers not be inspired? The decision to show in Shanghai came about nine months ago, before he designed the collection, so he had the city in mind when he whipped up the acid-color shearlings, handkerchief dresses, and trippy knits we saw on the runway tonight. We\u2019ve learned that the optics of a far-flung, one-off show can be tricky. Tonight\u2019s event wasn\u2019t a \u201cChinese show\u201d\u2014there were no dragon prints or chinoiserie\u2014nor was it a marketing stunt that ignored China\u2019s history and codes completely. Instead, Vevers thought of it as a \u201cmash-up of New York and Shanghai.\u201d That started with the set: a supersize version of a New York City street, complete with a two-lane road, blinking traffic lights, neon bar and restaurant signage, and vintage cars. A few of his favorite New York models were flown in for the occasion, including Lexi Boling, Adesuwa Aighewi, Kiki Willems, and Indira Scott. Those beauties walked the runway alongside several new Chinese models whom Vevers scouted less than a week ago; Huang, the male model who opened the show, was one of them. It isn\u2019t an overstatement to say it could make his career. In addition to promoting the new collection, generating excitement among Chinese customers, and all the other things a runway show is supposed to do, this one created a platform for young talents, too. As for the clothes, the mash-up of Coach\u2019s hometown with its new favorite city was relatively subtle. \u201cWhat I\u2019m really struck by is the casualization of fashion on the streets,\u201d Vevers said. \u201cA lot of that has come from Asia, and it\u2019s becoming a bigger part of everyone\u2019s collections.\u201d At the same time, young Asian shoppers have a deep appreciation for fashion and newness; they\u2019ll wear Coach\u2019s metallic prairie dress but maybe with sneakers and a denim jacket. That high-low sense of style may have inspired Vevers to dial back the ruffles and eclecticism; in their place, he worked with rich colors, specifically monochrome looks that mixed different textures and shades. \u201cI liked the idea that these clothes were dipped in color,\u201d he said, pointing out a men\u2019s look that combined an oxblood jacket, maroon track pants, and a bright red T-shirt. \u201cIt gives it a more polished feel, and it\u2019s a bit more pulled-together.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean he abandoned Coach\u2019s tongue-in-cheek charms. Vevers said he was most inspired by Shanghai\u2019s contemporary art\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anywhere in the world with an art scene at this scale,\u201d he added\u2014and tapped four local artists to reinterpret Coach\u2019s mascot Rexy the dinosaur for the collection. (This is where those aforementioned young talents come in.) The twin brothers behind the music collective Yeti Out incorporated her (yes, Rexy is a her!) into their signature smiley face motif, for instance, and Guang Yu painted Rexy in spontaneous, graffiti-style paint. Also happily weird: Vevers\u2019s mention of \u201cearly Alice Cooper\u201d glam-rock references. \u201cIt feels Coach-y,\u201d he said. There were touches of that \u201cexuberant\u201d vibe in the clothes but more so in the collection\u2019s standout shoe: a heeled, chunky platform boot worn by guys and girls alike. We have a feeling you\u2019ll see it on the streets of New York, Shanghai, and everywhere in between."}, {"Designer": "Collina Strada", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Designer Hillary Taymour started her Pre-Fall 2019 collection asking some profound questions: What mistakes would you make again? How do you stay true in a chaotic world? How can silence speak? She came up with these queries while thinking about the fact that in a social media\u2013obsessed culture, we may slowly be losing our ability to appreciate person-to-person interaction. To pose another existential question: Is human contact on an emotional level becoming obsolete? Taymour is passionate about reaching people through her clothes. She wants to attract her customers with cool, sometimes experimental garments, but also via the ethos of her brand as a whole. Collina Strada is about youthfulness, humor, and the ability to look inward, even when we\u2019re wearing something loud on the outside. Her Pre-Fall lineup was successful because it showcased her messaging in a straightforward way, i.e. through brightly colored tie-dye T-shirts with the aforementioned quandaries scrawled across their fronts. Elsewhere Taymour showed pieces that were pared-back for her, like a black slip dress with thin tassels dangling from the straps. More vibrant were the striking deadstock fabric printed with a rainbow sheen on top of florals she used for a sheer lace dress and top, and a specially tie-dyed velvet. An uncharacteristically preppy checked jacket stood out, as did a simple pink frock with a slightly billowed skirt."}, {"Designer": "Colovos", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Nicole and Michael Colovos are digging into jeans in a major way for Pre-Fall. Denim was their first project together\u2014their Habitual line won them a runner-up position in the first CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund\u2014so this is a full-circle moment for the pair. That mutual history shows in this collection. The Colovoses are experts in denim minutiae, as in where to add a hip seam to enhance the figure, and more technical details about washes and hardware. They\u2019re keen to make their production process as \u201cgreen\u201d as possible these days, so they\u2019ve started using recycled metal for their button closures, and are investigating cleaner washes. All this would be irrelevant if they didn\u2019t also have an eye for cut and fit, but they\u2019re definitely not short in that department. At the moment, they\u2019re liking the look of a higher rise and a roomy, almost baggy leg that tapers above the ankle. They\u2019ve done a lot of interesting waistband treatments. Another clever exploration: the denim-print silk they cut into a shirtdress and super-high-waisted pants. (These reminded of a brilliant Martin Margiela collection from 1996 in which he made photo prints of sequins to create a series of fancy/not fancy trompe l\u2019oeil frocks.) From a distance, the Colovoses\u2019 denim-print silk looks like the genuine article, but the material is lightweight, so it\u2019s more or less humidity-proof. Take it from this New Yorker, there\u2019s nothing worse than jeans on the subway in an August heatwave. And that\u2019s not all they did for denimheads this season; there\u2019s also a dark rinse trench and a sharp blazer with rounded sleeves. The black silk dress with a micro-print of clasping hands is very Nicole C\u2014chic yet understated. It\u2019s the kind of easy-to-wear dress that could make you feel pulled together all summer long."}, {"Designer": "Cushnie", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Exoticism was top of mind for Carly Cushnie this season. The designer, who is now on her third official collection as head designer after her partner Michelle Ochs departed the brand, looked to three very distinct references while conceptualizing her Pre-Fall 2019 lineup. First came Jean Larivi\u00e8re\u2019s Cartier campaign from the 1950s, which features a doorman opening the high jewelry shop to a live leopard. Secondly, Cushnie looked to the 1980s excess featured throughout the film Coming to America, particularly the flora-and-fauna-filled scenes inside King Jaffe Joffer\u2019s gilded African palace. Finally, there was an early 2000s installation by the artist Cai Guo-Qiang titled Heritage. In it, an array of animal sculptures including tigers, giraffes, and zebras surround a watering hole; the work is meant to symbolize harmony in the natural world. In terms of print and silhouette, these three inspirations present a lot to work with. But even if Cushnie might have gone overboard with the leopard and the gold and the glamour, she demonstrated a sense of smart restraint. A black minidress with bunched tulle covering the arms and shoulders was a fantastic example of Cushnie\u2019s ability to inject flair without losing her signature minimalist aesthetic. The multi-paneled, partially pleated skirt that incorporated bits of leopard print with black, bronze, and marigold was a standout in this category too. Her evening gowns were of particular note. Only a baby blue suit felt out of step. On the whole, this was a well-rounded offering of the new Cushnie wardrobe: still sleek and streamlined but refreshingly wild, too.

Pre-Fall was designed in-house and presented in a showroom as a transitional commercial offering. Called Floral Breeze, it was a gracefully watered-down translation of Delpozo\u2019s expressive, illusionistic style. The collection was focused on a practical approach to daywear separates; shapes retained only a distant memory of the architectural extravagance of their previous incarnation. They looked neat, uncomplicated, and certainly wearable. Only a play of ruffles, which were appliqu\u00e9d on pockets, sleeves, and skirts, kept a certain whimsical spirit alive. They looked like humongous fluttering butterflies. Florals were actually rather charming. Mini bouquets blossomed on a bubblegum pink jacquard tailored pantsuit; faded roses were scattered on the pale blue chiffon of a delicate dress embroidered with sequins. A long evening dress exuded a similar feel of impalpable lightness; cut as a long caftan in silk tulle and finely pleated, it was worn over a silver-sequined slip minidress. The same pleated motif graced the porcelain blue long skirt of a flimsy dress, the floral silk jacquard bodice structured and shapely like a corset.

The wrap plays a supporting role here, however, in favor of a focus on slip dressing and pajama sets; both concepts are trending. The strength of Von Furstenberg\u2019s approach to them is her prints. Bold pattern is another constant at DVF, but two, in particular, this season have a special charm: the painted lemon motif of a lace-edged slip and the Matisse-ish swimmers of the matching pajama separates.

She never wavers from the concise, pristine shapes she favors\u2014not that they lack imagination or a subtly abrasive sense of humor. When asked for her inspiration, she usually gets slightly annoyed; she doesn\u2019t revert to muses or elaborate mood boards. \u201cI get inspired by people, how they live today; it\u2019s very contemporary,\u201d she said, brushing off the question. But for Pre-Fall, she did have a very personal memory in mind: the uniform she wore when she attended private primary school in the Turkish city of Bursa, where she\u2019s from. To elucidate the point, she sketched it on a piece of paper: a delightful pinafore in black-and-white cotton vichy with a ruched little skirt, a starched white shirt, and a red satin bow at the collar. Its almost archetypal feminine shape was the template for the collection\u2019s silhouette, rendered with Ege\u2019s succinct neatness and gracing an elegant daywear wardrobe. \u201cIt\u2019s soign\u00e9; it\u2019s not casual!\u201d she said in mock horror. The designer riffed on her beloved sculptural volumes and shapes; exact tailoring and geometric cuts were sustained by the consistency of high-quality Made in Italy fabrications, which helped define the contoured lines of short wool trapeze coats or abbreviated flounced jackets, worn with doll-like ruched miniskirts. A play of textures between pied-de-poule and pied-de-coq patterns added a touch of Parisian chic, as in a razor-sharp tailored pantsuit with an hourglass-cut blazer, or in a schoolteacher-pleated midi skirt paired with a graphic logoed wool sweater. The rigorous approach to substantial volumes peaked in Ege\u2019s version of the classic trenchcoat that every French woman keeps in her wardrobe. It was cut imaginatively with precise couture-ish folded sleeves and mismatched buttons. The waterproof fabric was so thick that Ege called it the cardboard trench.

Nowhere is this more evident than in the world of menswear, where adhering to sartorial codes is tantamount to law: A banker must wear this, a skater must wear that, and so on. Thank goodness for Kim Jones, who is building his vision for Dior Men with the notion that rules are meant to be broken. First, he separated himself from a decade of \u201cDior Homme\u201d and its super-skinny silhouette with a new name, and a fresh, boxier cut. Now, half a season in, he\u2019s taking his vision on the road, landing in Tokyo with a Pre-Fall extravaganza to rival the season\u2019s blockbuster womenswear shows. But more important than the name and the place is the why: Jones\u2019s vision for Dior Men is a theory of everything. On the runway tonight were items for all kinds of guys, from the ones who want to wear a monogram silk shirt with cherry blossom accents to others who are looking for dapper houndstooth suits with posh, asymmetric blazers. A white astrakhan bomber that shaded into a toile de Jouy summed it up: something elegant as hell, yet grounded in utility, and designed with couture craftsmanship and know-how. All of this was brought together around a 39-and-a-half-foot statue of a silver robo-babe by the Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama. What does this sexy fembot have to do with anything? To Jones, it\u2019s his way of honoring Monsieur Dior\u2019s legacy. Christian Dior was involved in the art world before he became a couturier, exhibiting Picassos in the late 1920s. Jones, for his part, has been obsessing over Sorayama\u2019s work for decades. Dior was also in love with Japan and Japanese culture; the show\u2019s two closing looks were based off of his own patterns for a Japanese client, rendered by Jones in buttery black leather. The couturier\u2019s signature cannage design was redone for the runway on the back of a workwear-influenced harness, and elsewhere, the colors of his childhood home in Granville, France\u2014pink (the house) and gray (the sky)\u2014became the blush of the cherry blossoms and the silver of their backgrounds. For proof of success of this decade-connecting modernism, look no further than the diversity of outfits in Jones\u2019s front row. David Beckham was there in a posh suit, Ezra Miller in a pink cherry blossom top, Kate Moss in a loose blazer, A$AP Rocky in a sheer shirt and metallic trousers, and Bella Hadid in the show\u2019s opening turtleneck with high-top monogram sneakers. The universal appeal of Jones\u2019s vision is impressive. Men like it, women like it, and maybe even robots could like it, too. That\u2019s a future that would be pretty bright, indeed.

At that time of year, they\u2019re probably hopping on (private) planes for far-flung, exotic destinations. Dundas is a designer who shares his clients\u2019 wanderlust; in his world, life and work blend seamlessly together. His boyfriend, Evangelo Bousis, is also his business partner and a source of inspiration, so much so that the new collection actually revolves around a vintage African batik caftan that belongs to him. Dundas translated the motifs into a linen print for one of the many minidresses that peppered the lineup: big-shouldered, one-sleeved, ruffled, and draped on the hips, with a touch of black lace peeking seductively underneath. This collection didn\u2019t stray from Dundas\u2019s true-and-tested recipe: a sexy, unabashedly glamorous look, where free-spirited \u201970s bohemia blends with the audacity of the \u201980s. A long, sensual number in purple chiffon worn with a matching cape played against a pair of black leather sequined shorts paired with a leather brassiere; an asymmetrical ruffle-hemmed, one-sleeved dress in printed silk jacquard contrasted with a military-inspired mini tunic in khaki cotton canvas, redolent of Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s famous safari look. A bit of soft tailoring was added for good measure, but in Dundas-land, anything boardroom-ready wouldn\u2019t do; a shimmering golden blazer, worn over a matching jumpsuit with a plunging neckline would be well suited for an alluring, genetically blessed Jerry Hall type. It is rather obvious that Dundas\u2019s fashion propositions aren\u2019t for everyone, so how is he addressing today\u2019s inclusivity debate? \u201cMy collections are for women who are not afraid to be seen, who like to shine,\u201d he said.

For me it\u2019s about giving confidence, not requiring confidence. There are so many ways to express glamour.

Among the recurring themes was a chain motif rendered several ways: in shimmering embroidery; as actual chain, very fine and applied to highlight the body; and as an allover print.

As she said, \u201cThey\u2019re unique but easy to wear.\u201d There\u2019s a romantic modernity in Ellery\u2019s vision, a compelling interest in nostalgic silhouettes reinvented for today. This season, she looked for inspiration in what she called simpler times. The conservative lifestyle of Amish communities and the free-love spirit of the \u201970s in Britain and America seemed to be apropos. They\u2019re rather opposite aesthetics, really, but the duality fueled a balancing game of deconstruction, with architectural, almost severe elements softened by feminine flourishes. Cases in point were the cascading sculptural frills that punctuated the collection and the bibs that merged with leather minidresses, as well as the small handkerchief-hemmed aprons\u2013slash\u2013ruched corsets worn with shirts featuring exaggerated cuffs. On the same note, voluminous round sleeves introduced an almost Elizabethan flair, contrasting in black leather on a linear white dress. The same imaginative audacity was highlighted by the elaborate pearl bras and bibs decorating wide-leg pantsuits, as well as the artsy handcrafted belt buckles carved from mother-of-pearl. Tailoring and outerwear were proposed in oversize versions; a classic trenchcoat got the deconstruction treatment via a bold take on cut.

The pictures she\u2019d pinned up of the flamboyantly chic editor of Flair in the \u201950s (Cowles had cofounded an American advertising agency and sold it, and self-published a magazine of fashion, art, and literary contributions) were interspersed with Cowles\u2019s paintings of roses. Really, you could see how Cowles could resonate as an ideal heroine to this independent designer whose business relies equally on tough day-to-day toil, succinctly updated social dress codes, and, yes, lots of flowers. Wickstead\u2019s lookbook was shot very recently in New Zealand, \u201cback home\u201d to her, where summer is in full swing. There, among the luscious, burgeoning flower gardens of Auckland, are some of the things that the designer does best\u2014pretty, semi-formal, covered-up flower dresses; crepe tailoring; a corseted top with matching trousers. This time, there was a soup\u00e7on of eccentricity with head coverings, either scarves printed to match dresses or spotted net veils that Wickstead attributed to her study of Cowles\u2019s style. Her choice of location puts her on the same page as Rodarte, with its show of romantic dresses in a New York cemetery, and adjacent to the haunting girls\u2013gardening film Simone Rocha shot with Tyler Mitchell for Moncler. Wickstead is far from being a conceptual designer, but her pictures tune into the odd, slightly saccharine atmospherics surrounding the sweet, modest thematics of the moment. Still, the real narrative moving Wickstead\u2019s business forward is her pitch for protocol-compliant daywear, like her trousers and scarf-neck blouses in subtle, though distinctive, block colors.

The sporty references were well in evidence in a series of layered ribbed T-shirts in sherbet colors, worn with glossy vinyl miniskirts in fresh hues of aqua, strawberry pink, and tangerine for a touch of quirk. Elsewhere, the vinyl minis were paired with elegant, billowy poet-sleeved printed blouses, while a long pliss\u00e9 circle skirt boasted new Pucci motifs, embroidered all over with sparkling sequins. Rather glamorous were the one-shouldered, finely pleated, sequined evening dresses, which could be paired with lacquered shearling peacoats or generous wrap coats in hues of turquoise or lavender. Shearling peacoats and wraps were also shown worn over printed velvet midi tunics with matching palazzo pants for a cool, layered pajama effect. Pucci wouldn\u2019t be Pucci without its electrifying prints; for Pre-Fall they were proposed in pyrotechnic new iterations suggestively called Vallauris, Fortuna, Mirabilis, and Burle.

Erdem has one of his subtle hidden purposes for bringing our attention to the place. Because\u2014guess what?\u2014there were three centuries when women were not allowed in here to draw the naked human form. Not until Laura Knight was made the first full Royal Academician, just as British women were finally getting the vote (well, some of them), in 1918. Knight\u2019s paintings were all over his mood board\u2014her Self-Portrait in which she shows a back view of herself painting a nude model\u2014as well as documentary photographs, fashion illustrations, and memorabilia leading up to the Second World War. \u201cI was thinking about her more in the \u201940s, really,\u201d the designer related, pointing out the padded shoulders, belted waists, and floral dresses, as well as the quirky turbans he commissioned from his longtime millinery collaborator Noel Stewart, with whom he became friends when they were students at The Royal College of Art. It all goes back to art school with Erdem\u2014and his research in libraries, bookstores, and galleries. Knight, he pointed out, was commissioned as a war artist; she documented the lives of women at work in the military, and eventually (harrowingly) the Nuremberg trials. There were also more practical Blitz-period trouser suits, a jumpsuit, and a couple of sober tailored coats. One day it would be wonderful to see Erdem costume a movie; he\u2019s already won a Design Museum award for his Royal Ballet costumes this year. That, though, would require significant time off from the treadmill of fashion (not that he ever complains). You always sense the necessity to him of finding a narrative, chasing a person or the spirit of a time in his work. Even if it ultimately results in looking nothing much like his storytelling, he knows how he got to making those beautiful creations: mercurial sequin poured on white lace, floaty high-waisted print dresses, quirky rose-printed tights. They\u2019re done with at least as much conviction and finesse as his runway collection, that\u2019s safe to say. Still: Look, it\u2019s nearly the holidays!

When the collection\u2019s titular star enters the space, she draws smiles and a few direct greetings; mostly, everyone just carries on, as there is a wide selection from which to choose. Yet despite revisiting similar ideas from one season to the next, Marant manages to update her distinct uniform. She noted how this offering proposes soft, cozy layers in dusty hues alongside relaxed military references. Think blanket capes, sweater coats, and quilted vests coexisting with khaki jumpsuits, taupe trenchcoats, and utility pants covered in seams and pockets yet feminine in fit. Predictably, there were also updates of her popular Victorian reinterpretations\u2014shirtdresses with smocking around the neckline and lace blouses boasting a spray of ruffles. While certain looks veered French rustic, others were obstinately Parisian; the best\u2014an ivory dress cinched with a sexy corset belt, say\u2014expressed both. \u00c9toile\u2019s main demographic might not be old enough to have worn the circa-1980s leather jackets like the ones that appear here\u2014ditto the stonewashed jeans; to some, vintage might have more street cred, yet these versions give off 2019 finesse.

For Pre-Fall, they took inspiration from a book on 19th-century French ironwork gates and an antique tome on men\u2019s Japanese kimonos. The collection\u2019s dialogue between curlicued baroque graphics and almost inconspicuous exotic micro patterns was a virtuoso exercise in decorative bravura. To counterbalance the abundance of surface ornamentation, shapes were kept strict, tailored, and masculine, highlighting the play on opposites that is one of Fendi\u2019s compelling style traits. Coats and double-breasted blazers were cut sharp, severe, and elongated, often boasting quirky asymmetrical lapels. Softened with discreet mink details and sometimes cinched at the waist for a feminine hourglass silhouette, they were worn over sensual see-through dresses or with full-circle, swirling pliss\u00e9 skirts. The masculine tailoring was again counterpointed by an injection of sporty utilitarian elements, rendered with eccentric flair, as in a shirt-jacket hybrid that was one of the collection\u2019s new proposals. The best example was in a bright turquoise shade of soft suede, unfussily cut in slightly oversize proportions and paired with acid green cropped pants. Practical pockets as big as bags sprouted from a zippered leather city coat embossed with the double-F logo. On a sensational \u201970s-inspired slim and belted midi coat in punched leather net, the pockets came in fluffy quilted red mink. As always chez Fendi, craftsmanship was stellar; here, the curlicue motifs were rendered in as many conceivable artisanal (shall we say artistic?) iterations as possible: printed all over on silk jacquard, embroidered on silk tulle, or as mink intarsia inlaid on a mink fur bomber. A sumptuous black coat was emblazoned with the ironwork motif in silver silicone; apparently, its prototype was made using a pastry icing bag and then rendered serially. It really looked like a succulent piece of cake. With the same hyperbolic sense of experimentation, the pattern was embroidered on silk tulle via thin-sliced strips of leather, painstakingly hand-sewn to achieve the look of the flimsiest lace, which was the fabric of choice for ethereal yet densely decorated evening dresses, light as feathers and of exquisite feminine allure."}, {"Designer": "Frame", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Some people may soon forget that Frame started out as a denim label.

Come spring, they\u2019ll be introducing their first swimwear, as well as additional bag shapes and sizes. Grede and Torstensson also plan to open a number of Frame stores around the country in the next 12 months.

In their New York studio this week, Torstensson showed off a number of new silhouettes, including their debut California jeans, which sit low on the hips and have an extra-wide leg.

This season, though, was something different. Founders Anna-Christin Haas, Sola Harrison, Katherine Holmgren, and Carolyn Hodler gave in to their rebellious side, if even just a tad. They said their Pre-Fall collection was inspired by the underground post-punk scene in late 1970s Berlin; David Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust phase; and the cult film of the era, Christiane F. Mismatched stripes on a ruffled dress and slip and in the nightclub-ready metallic neon greens, reds, and pinks did bring Bowie and his Ziggy character to mind. The chic, slim black and white suiting was perhaps more Thin White Duke. It was satisfying to see the Galvan ladies take a new approach in terms of color, texture, and silhouette.

Giamba\u2019s posse of sophisticated nymphs, usually in ethereal layers of flimsy floral chiffon, seemed here to have taken a slightly naughtier U-turn. \u201cIt\u2019s more androgynous, less Lolita,\u201d Valli said. There was definitely more dynamism in the short T-shirt dresses worn under voluminous leopard-printed eco-furs. Similarly, a sporty energy infused the macram\u00e9 bombers embroidered with glittery lips and stars. A python-printed bright blue biker jacket paired with a lacy next-to-nothing miniskirt was a touch flamboyant. The romantic flair so dear to Valli was expressed here with more quirk than usual.

As for the evergreen blazer, it was proposed in slimmed-down versions, malleable and soft as a sweater, and paired with knee-length Bermudas or with shorts-skirt hybrids. A sense of ease was apparent throughout the collection, which riffed on the familiar masculine-feminine dynamic, a territory pioneered by Armani and still mastered with style.

Then again, designers don\u2019t nudge fashion forward by playing it safe. For the Pre-Fall Givenchy collections, Clare Waight Keller chose the myth of Icarus as her overarching message and included various allusions to deities, minotaurs, the sky, and the sea. \u201cMythology always seems to capture people\u2019s imagination. There\u2019s a dreamlike element, but it\u2019s also grounded in something pertinent,\u201d she explained. Quite likely personal, too. One year and a royal wedding dress later, it can sometimes feel as though there\u2019s some shadowy, collective expectation that Waight Keller\u2019s rise should be steeper, more daring. Certainly, beautifully executed, wearable clothes are enough. In the images, some of which were shot against the backdrop of Maison La Roche, one of Le Corbusier\u2019s marvelous Paris landmarks, the looks don\u2019t immediately signal such epic storytelling or existential questions. Coincidence or not, many of the jackets and coats have been tailored like modernist architecture: engineered without excess. When you see the volumes of sleeves and pant legs, you realize that they have been constructed so no additional styling is required. The subtle checked patchwork of a faux fur coat; the gradient tint of a leather skirt; and the silkiness of a vinyl trench do not go unnoticed. What also comes through is Waight Keller\u2019s continued restoration of Givenchy\u2019s aristocratic leanings, whether through relatively casual knit dresses and cargo pants, or through dressier poufs of plumetis and elongated suiting. Likewise, draped leather boots and the new Mystic bag with its half-concealed hardware suggest more discreet status symbols\u2014which isn\u2019t necessarily an oxymoron. As Waight Keller noted, \u201cThere\u2019s this feeling of being somewhat muted about things.\u201d But what about the themes? Well, these were conjured up vividly in the menswear with hand-drawn illustrations and embroidery that Waight Keller said were inspired by Picasso\u2019s own exploration of mythology. Most elaborate: a blouson embroidered with album cover art as though Icarus were a band. Whoever came up with Flew Too Close as the title for this \u201cvocal quartet\u201d (a nod to the four Gs of the logo) put forth some commendable first-degree wit. With the womenswear, and perhaps rightly so, Icarus was harder to detect. Sure, the ostrich-feathered tunic and the wing-like protrusions of a yellow minidress might have nodded to our fallen hero, but first and foremost, they were chic. Incidentally, Icarus was also name-checked this week by Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, who, during the Business of Fashion\u2019s Voices conference, described how the political marketing firm used clothing preferences from Facebook to target people. If Waight Keller seems risk-averse, she employs her ideas with intention. She mentioned her current fascination with philosopher Joseph Campbell\u2019s The Power of Myth, in which he explores the continued relevance of such age-old tales. \u201cWe\u2019re searching and trying to find reasons for things,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd these myths and stories bring sense and meaning to things going on in our lives.\u201d "}, {"Designer": "Gucci", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Gucci\u2019s Pre-Fall collection was presented without the fanfare to which the brand\u2019s global audience has become accustomed.

Prominent styles included caftans\u2014the best in exotic, rich brocades\u2014and three-piece printed suits in which blazers were worn over elongated tunics for a new layered silhouette.

T-shirts and knits have mass appeal; four-figure party dresses? Not so much. In a few years, we won\u2019t have to argue that sustainability is luxury, but until then, there are a few evening designers who are making the case. Out in Los Angeles, Mary Alice Haney is one of them. As a first-person witness to last month\u2019s wildfires, she admits the health of the planet is her biggest concern these days. She introduced Haney\u2019s Green Label a few seasons back, which consists of lower-priced dresses made from leftover fabrics. (Reducing waste will be a top priority for other woke brands in 2019.) Most of those fabrics are sourced from eco-friendly and low-impact couture mills in Italy and France. The silky eco-material of a split-sleeve red minidress, for instance, felt truly luxe\u2014and the woman who buys it will notice.

The refinement of the tiny stitches, the rounded paneling, and the supple glaze of it is a wonder. Ditto the Herm\u00e8s orangey tan leather car coat\u2014just look at those flat, topstitched pockets! Just as easily, one could go off into a rapture of contemplation of the leather pyramide buttons on a shearling coat. Vanhee-Cybulski said she\u2019d planned out this collection around this idea of a flaneur\u2014someone strolling around Paris, noticing things (sans phone, one would presume)\u2014because it is a civilized luxury to have the time, as well as the money, to just wander, wondering, maybe while wearing those attractive, comfortable-looking rubber-soled riding boots. So much of Herm\u00e8s culture is hidden in plain sight. It\u2019s simple seeming at first glance, inoffensive even.

That capsule has been a huge hit for Holland since it was first introduced for Resort (its pin-striped iteration has been worn by practically the entire Kardashian clan).

There are so many tones in one motif,\u201d he said of the design\u2019s fearless palette, which was echoed elsewhere in a tie-dye take on animal print. These fabrications were, apparently, an introduction to the concept that\u2019s central to Holland\u2019s forthcoming ready-to-wear show: \u201cI was thinking about an urban nomad who draws on so many global references from East and West,\u201d he said. All those reworked tie-dyes and blanket weaves, which appeared on second-skin tops, hoodies, maxi shirtdresses and a collection of performance swimwear made in collaboration with Speedo, lent a laid-back air to the proceedings which was suggestive of the clubby days of the \u201990s. \u201cPeople have that instant association when it comes to all things tie-dye,\u201d said Holland of the surfer styling. \u201cIt seems to really resonate.\u201d One thing is clear: Holland is still in the throes of channeling his epic creativity towards a newly unified brand vision. \u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve jumped from one idea to the next,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s not about reinventing the wheel every few months, it\u2019s about an evolution.\u201d Judging by what was on offer here, he\u2019s slowly but surely finding that flow."}, {"Designer": "Iceberg", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Milan\u2019s weekend culture is one of its peculiar traits: With clockwork precision on Fridays city dwellers escape to the seaside in summer or to the mountains during the winter months. As a Londoner living in Lombardy since his appointment at Iceberg\u2019s helm in 2015, creative director James Long has embraced the wintry commute to the slopes; he even shares a house in an old village in the Alps with friends. \u201cIt\u2019s all about learning how the Italians live and how it blends with my London punky culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThe story for Pre-Fall is Milan office working hours nine-to-five on weekdays and then apr\u00e8s-ski fun party time in the mountains during the weekend.\u201d And so the collection was built from sporty pieces injected with the irreverent vibe that the designer favors. Puffer jackets and nylon anoraks in flashing colors were emblazoned with a red and white striped motif that Long called \u201ctwisted slaloms,\u201d for a bit of Italian show-off attitude, while a silk twill shirt was printed in \u201ca blizzard of crazy puzzle graphics.\u201d Glowing sequined intarsia and side patches gave black jersey tracksuits a jolt of acid apr\u00e8s-ski glamour. While logos are still central to building brand identities, here Long opted for a low-key gesture, hiding the Iceberg insignia in folds zippered on pants\u2019 sides or on sleeves\u2019 cuffs. He also focused on a more upscale knitwear offering, mixing optical graphics and grungy elements with a much-worn feel, like unfinished hems, hanging threads, and a Mickey Mouse embroidered in faded wool on an oversize, spongy knitted cardigan. Tailoring isn\u2019t usually a focus at Iceberg, but seeing as it is a big trend, the designer obliged, offering a sporty, personal take on the look, cutting fluid tailored pantsuits in technical fabrics accented with slalom stripes.

Season after season, the designer delivers wardrobe standbys imbued with elusive Parisian allure. For Pre-Fall specifically, you might notice subtle silhouette adjustments: detailing at the shoulders or sleeves of blouses and dresses, and pleated pants with just the right waist-to-hip ratio thanks to an integrated snap-front belt. Indeed, these images suggest a renewed emphasis on dresses following the colorful corduroy trousers that were ubiquitous throughout the previous pre-collection. Most of them short and sassy in various prints and unexpected hues of burgundy, orchid, and violet, they offer lively alternatives to the LBDs that are in your closet. What came through in the showroom and is reinforced here is how each piece seems to have built-in attitude: funnel-neck cashmere sweaters with nonchalant slouch; trenchcoats with more dramatic volume; boots that fold over without effort. Sparing you those extra styling steps is no small feat. Compared to the cleaner lines of the chinos, some draping appeared less attractive\u2014and executed to better effect elsewhere. Which is why the leather pants will be worthy of the splurge; ultra-supple with lacing up the sides, they embody what you expect from Marant, which she described as \u201csophisticated but nonetheless cool.\u201d And you can be sure they will be flattering\u2014yet another plus."}, {"Designer": "J.

Artist Danh Vo\u2019s deconstructed Lady Liberty sculptures, rendered in copper, got the designer thinking about metallics. Flou is important to this designer, so the collection\u2019s title, \u201cArmor With Amour\u201d was a bit misleading. It wasn\u2019t the hard durability of metal Mendel was thinking of\u2014most of his dresses had a molten quality of movement\u2014but the way light flashes off of its surfaces. He did have a strong woman in mind though, and this, combined with the shine of metallics led him, in turn, to the (trending) 1980s, when disco was still playing in clubs. \u201cIt was definitely a glamorous moment [and] a time where women liked to go out and they liked to dance, and I think the dancing vibration translated very well into my clothes,\u201d he said. Some of the shorter, more \u201cperiod\u201d looks echoed those seen recently at places like Saint Laurent; the opening lookbook image, an oversize and glittering jacket, was true to its inspiration: the divine Grace Jones. The most casual look in the collection\u2014relatively speaking, that is\u2014was a sheared mink bomber jacket/minidress with strass trimming, but it\u2019s the get-dressed-up-and-hit-the-town dresses that are always the draw here. The most Mendel-looking were the hand-pleated looks. It turns out that this signature handwork (which can be applied to any silhouette), stems from a source far distant from the hedonistic greed decade. \u201cI always had a love affair with Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire,\u201d said Mendel. \u201cWhen I started to design clothes my dream was to make that Ginger Rogers moment, and hand pleating was a perfect way because it was taking chiffon, which is the lightest material ever, and pleating it in a way that it feels airy and has texture and lightness. You want to dance with it on.\u201d And so the beat goes on chez Mendel.

The designer has also created a new, sharper logo and launched a lingerie/loungewear line. He is laser focused on streamlining his business and bringing it into a new era where strategy and voice are key. In terms of Jason Wu, he\u2019s doing a bang-up job of designing clothes that are, at least figuratively, cut from the same cloth as those in his main line. They have a slightly lower price tag, but the pieces are just as beautifully made and have just as much of the feminine, glamorous allure that has drawn so many women into Wu\u2019s orbit over the past decade. His Pre-Fall 2019 collection highlighted this fact in that the offering was filled with gorgeous fabrics and relatable silhouettes, the kind that could fill up the everyday wardrobe of his clientele. He drew inspiration from florists Darroch and Michael Putnam, whom he has collaborated with many times over the past few years, and their new book, Flower Colour Guide. There were two or three floral-print dresses that straightforwardly nodded to his favorite blooms, but mostly Wu focused on expressing his adoration for the Putnams and their work by mimicking certain color palettes and shapes for which they\u2019ve become known. A sweet deep green minidress with pleating details at the bust was certainly a highlight, along with a sculptural anorak and a long, blush pink slip dress with subtle ruffle detailing at the neckline and skirt hem. The check shirt, gray cable-knit sweater, and silky trouser combination was nice, too, as was a black cotton dress with balloon sleeves and a banded waist.

The London designer had been immersing herself in the fabulous world of Aarons\u2019s Women, in a collection that pulled its palette right from his saturated images. So a candid shot of legendary socialite Babe Paley off-duty at her Jamaican retreat gave rise to sumptuous cinder rose palazzo pants and a crystal-embellished crop top, while Jackie O at the April in Paris ball\u2014and a bevy of dewy-skinned 1960s debutantes\u2014inspired gowns that ran the gamut from pearl to golden quartz to cherry red. Packham\u2019s midcentury source material resonated strongest in the simplest looks. Flared-sleeved gowns with clean-lined silhouettes and minimal sprinklings of hot-fix crystals, rich wool wrap coats with abstract crystal motifs, and a crepe cocktail dress with a lightly embellished tulle neckline\u2014all were striking in their restraint. These are the looks that will most seamlessly make their way into the lives and wardrobes of Packham\u2019s own glamorous circle of women.

And it seems right to say that so far they\u2019ve been rather successful at polishing a blend of sensitive, thoughtful minimalism, where dry conceptualism is banned in favor of a certain rigorous yet sensuous simplicity and of a subtle, luxurious restraint. Pre-Fall was in keeping with the rules of style explored in the Spring show. \u201cWe really wanted to work into simplicity,\u201d said Lucie. \u201cWorking around the form and then working deeper into this form in a very textured, detailed way.\u201d To give geometric shapes a compelling twist, they used their technical expertise. \u201cWe started from pure, essential forms,\u201d added Luke. \u201cA little off the body, sculptural, square, and then from there we worked into the technique, mixing fabrics and textures, adding interesting details, but also keeping a lot of rawness; for example, we used raw canvas and then we added broderie anglaise on it, giving it a richness while starting from a humble, honest material.\u201d Stripping things away, they arrived at a very pure silhouette and then played on defining surfaces and volumes, where textured mixes were assembled via a sophisticated, not-so-simple execution. Built-in decorative details became an integral part of the garments\u2019 construction; patches and intarsias of different wools and canvas in mainly neutral shades were artfully stitched together, reconfiguring graphic, gently oversize volumes. \u201cThey\u2019re not oversize really,\u201d said Lucie. \u201cThey\u2019re generous, friendly volumes; it\u2019s all about comfort, the softness around the body. There are no hard edges.\u201d And while shapes were kept precise and sharp, they exuded the tactile, cozy feel of malleable double wools, lightly padded silks, and spongy, natural felts. A touch of folksiness added warmth to the sculptural, elevated flair of the collection, as in a series of square-shaped jackets and cabans, cut and sewn out of striped wool blankets. The same tactile, quiet ease tinged a sporty duvet, padded and sculptural yet light and round, which could be worn off the shoulders backpack-style, hanging on built-in straps; the designers call it the Gallery Coat.

After staging her first Resort show over the summer in New York, the Colombian designer is marking her brand\u2019s 15th birthday with another milestone: her first Pre-Fall collection. Ortiz ventured out of her exotic floral-print comfort zone this season, adding animal motifs to her repertoire (also a first). The mottled feline that appears on midi-length pleated and ruffled silk dresses is no ordinary jaguar, though; this one in particular is indigenous to the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountains of Ortiz\u2019s homeland and a potent symbol in pre-Columbian culture. Colored in earth tones and dusky shades of blue and green, the most eye-catching pattern in the bunch drew from the ceramic traditions of the region and lent a soulful, vaguely vintage vibe to cotton maxi dresses, the Central American answer to India\u2019s famous block-print silks. Ortiz is well known for her party frocks\u2014usually ruffled, usually floor-sweeping\u2014and added minidresses to her lineup for the first time. The label is expanding its daytime offerings, too, building on shirtdresses and peasant tops with smart summer tailoring, including a Western-inspired take on the pajama suit. Longtime fans of the line will remember the days when swimsuits were the designer\u2019s mainstay. She went back to her roots for Pre-Fall, so to speak, with a series of statement-making maillots, part of a growing new business that she\u2019s calling beach-to-bar wear.

Conventionally for Pre-Fall, its delivery will run from the lightweight days of May to the outerwear-curious month of July.

Clayton has already stated that she intends to \u201crealign\u201d Joseph on her watch to make it consistent with her interpretation of the vision of its founder, Joseph Ettedgui. For now there was no inkling of the changes to come. The transition here proved strictly seasonal and still felt inflected by a post-Trotter pendulum, swinging between masculine and feminine. This was expressed via smockish fluid dresses in florally bastardized dogtooth, a catalog of tailored pant shapes in stretch gabardine, a softly tailored Le Smoking, a gray marled woolen utility pant and high-waisted military shirt, a lounge-lizard camel hair shawl-collar coat, and a pared-down duffle coat in a fantastically violent shade of orange. This color pulsed on an irresistibly tactile napa leather padded mailer-like bag, the occasional shoe, and some of the dresses, too. Alongside a brace of super-shaggy shearlings, that orange interlude provided the loudest shout in what was for the most part an impeccably even-toned exercise in slouchily luxurious apparel.

And how can the concept of status be revisited and translated for a progressive fashion mind-set? These ponderous topics were on creative director Paul Surridge\u2019s mind while working on the Just Cavalli Pre-Fall collection; he\u2019s trying to give a better defined and more relevant character to Cavalli\u2019s little sister line, putting the label in a broader contemporary perspective. \u201cEven between tribes and subcultures, the idea of status still runs strong,\u201d he mused. \u201dSo I started from the concept of uniforms and the codes defining the identity of clans and young social groups.\u201d Just Cavalli\u2019s heritage vocabulary doesn\u2019t lack for identity: Rock, glamour, rebellion, and a provocative sort of sexiness have always been its key words. Surridge\u2019s filter on this rather straightforward lexicon is sophisticated and nuanced, while keeping the collection\u2019s unconventional spirit alive. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving an attitude and not a clich\u00e9d replica; it\u2019s bringing up memories without being too literal. It\u2019s a soft exploration through all those themes,\u201d he said. Traditional JC tropes were given an upscale, polished feel; archival references were tempered and packaged into a modern, versatile wardrobe, where even sporty or street accents were handled lightly. Case in point was the treatment of denim, one of the label\u2019s most recognizable staples. The utility fabric was infused with an extravagant, slightly historical feel, as in an elongated boxy jacket paired with a miniskirt, quilted and studded to be reminiscent of a regal Elizabethan portrait. Yet the collage-printed neoprene thigh-high hybrid cowboy boots\u2013leggings that complemented the outfit looked progressive enough to erase any soup\u00e7on of mellow nostalgia. The idea of reworked status staples was suggested in a white classic boucl\u00e9 skirtsuit, the jacket trimmed with multiple thin gold chains for a mild rock flair, while tartan was translated into a graphic windowpane motif in a loose-fitting robe coat, taken slightly out of context with a \u201920s-inspired fringed hem. The collection offered solutions diverse enough to address the inclusivity factor, appealing to a broader spending demographic. A good example was a generously cut porcelain blue wrap coat, peak-lapeled and billow-shouldered, powerful looking without being ostentatious: \u201cIt\u2019s not about power dressing anymore, but about feeling confident, letting the femininity come through,\u201d Surridge said.

Details were intentionally focused from the neck up (think: ruffled and pointed collars), as Walker envisioned the wearer seated at a chess table.

It\u2019s not often you find such gems at a showroom appointment, let alone from a designer known for daywear and jeans. The items that qualified for Pre-Fall included a crimson poplin dress with super-full sleeves and a scooped-out back; a cotton bustier dress with a single leather cord looped through as a strap; and a creamy linen dress with a big swath of dotted tulle floating around the hem. They were as timeless and wearable as anything else you\u2019d find at Khaite, but felt happily unfamiliar. Holstein chalked it all up to her 35th birthday. She designed the collection in the (sometimes anxious) months leading up to it, and opted to do so without a mood board or specific reference. Instead, she simply created the pieces she felt she needs in her closet\u2014and, because her instincts are so right on, what other women need in theirs. She cut jackets with strong, wide-set shoulders, a silhouette that nudges you to stand up a little straighter and hold your head a bit higher.

Perhaps that darker, sultrier vibe is in the air as a reaction to the past few years of arty prints and eccentric, unsexy dressing. It wouldn\u2019t be the first trend Holstein anticipated: Since she introduced lacy bras and cotton bandeaux last season, other designers have followed suit.

As in genetics, they have to be hybridized with different codes in order to survive.\u201d Phung\u2019s Darwinian formula is quite simple, but is presumably proving effective: updating just so the floral prints, keeping them at the core of the label\u2019s identity, while working on a believable wardrobe, with modern pieces injected alongside current fashion trends. This was her approach for Pre-Fall, which was inspired by a trip to Jaipur. Sporty accents were discreetly added to silk jersey pajama ensembles printed with the exuberant Leonard florals; the pajamas were combined with easy quilted jackets for a comfortable feel. A kimono in printed double neoprene had a modern appeal, while linear city coats revealed linings in contrasting prints. They had a grown-up, elegant flair. But capturing a young, cool audience is essential for survival; Phung\u2019s Leonard could stand to be further hybridized with more evolutionary, game-changing experiments."}, {"Designer": "Les Copains", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Les Copains is an Italian label known for high-end knitwear in noble fibers and sporty yet elegant outerwear.

Fabrics were rich and tactile, like double cashmeres, mohairs, and baby alpacas; they formed loose-fitting and easy silhouettes, as in a trapeze-cut caban with knitted details or an elongated duster in tones of stucco and dove gray. Touches of Lurex and small sequins were woven into houndstooth wools and mohairs, giving a graceful allure to masculine-inspired pantsuits worn with oversize sweaters or sporty duvets paired with track pants in fluid jersey. The mood was kept balanced and relaxed; a fuchsia three-piece suit gave a jolt of energy to an otherwise calm, controlled lineup.

The core tenets are still the same: derri\u00e8re-flattering denim paired with a boxy jacket, cerebral knitwear (this season\u2019s is inspired by a heating layer worn by the Air Force under their flight suits).

Chanel installed itself at the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Valentino\u2019s Pierpaolo Piccioli took his pre-collection all the way to Tokyo, and Coach descended on Shanghai. Of course, the social media impressions were ginormous. Louis Vuitton\u2019s Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, whose Resort show was held at the South of France\u2019s Fondation Maeght last May, hasn\u2019t put on a Pre-Fall show per se, but what he\u2019s pulled off is just as major: a lookbook shoot lensed by his frequent collaborator, Collier Schorr, starring the likes of Alicia Vikander, Jennifer Connelly, Ruth Negga, and Laura Harrier. Fashion and Hollywood have long had a reciprocal relationship, but this shoot\u2014conducted in New York over two days shortly before Christmas in what Ghesqui\u00e8re described as a tour de force of logistics\u2014makes the synergies explicit. The cast includes 17 performers of one kind or another, most of whom are regulars in his front row. Oscar winners and nominees were photographed along with newcomers like Kelsey Asbille, Indya Moore, and Urassaya Sperbund. On a phone call from Paris, Ghesqui\u00e8re explained the impetus behind the all-star casting this way: \u201cThe more I work, the more it\u2019s about their response for me. It\u2019s inspiring to see the second life of the clothes. For an \u2018in-between\u2019 collection, for which we don\u2019t do a runway show, I thought it would be great to have their point of view.\u201d The designer and his longtime stylist, Marie-Am\u00e9lie Sauv\u00e9, worked to put together looks that the women \u201cfelt were right for them.\u201d L\u00e9a Seydoux wears a siren-y floral-print sheath with a plunging V-neckline; Kelela layers a plaid blanket jacket over a floral dress over contrasting floral pants; Doona Bae models an oversize checked sweater and animal-print skirt. The majority of the women carry handbags, what Ghesqui\u00e8re called \u201cinversions\u201d of styles previously seen on the runway. Without a formal show, Pre-Fall is Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s opportunity to dig into items that performed well in the recent past and ideas that bear further exploration. The wedge-heeled boots, for example, are an elaboration of the best-selling Archlight sneaker he showed for Spring 2018 and very nearly as weightless. Zhong Chuxi wears a great-looking navy peacoat with the raglan shoulders and rounded sleeves of Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s Spring 2019 outing. But it would be a mistake to say that this is a collection of basics, certainly not the way the items are put together, with clashing prints and offhand pairings, most often homey plaids and slick animal graphics. The juxtaposition of the rustic with the very urban is something new for Ghesqui\u00e8re, who has always had a sci-fi, futuristic bent. He even mentioned the Amish as a reference point. Though Vikander\u2019s and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz\u2019s calico and lace dresses are far from humble, something of the frontier woman comes through in their belted silhouettes. \u201cThis vision of American culture, the pioneer\u2014I love that this is exotic for us.

In winter they don\u2019t hibernate; they need warm, comforting clothes like the rest of us. So for Pre-Fall, Beccaria worked on an expanded offering of cozy daywear and outerwear, without straying too far from the dreamy mood she favors. Chic little coats in blue checkered tweed were cut trapeze-shaped and slightly retro, paired with matching ankle-grazing skirts and floral-printed organza blouses for a touch of whimsy. A pink tweed city coat with a stitched satin collar and pockets was reminiscent of the tiny fitted coats little girls usually wear as winter uniforms in private schools. The cozy feel of an elongated waistcoat in knitted mohair topped a feminine ensemble in which a bohemian blouse in floral chiffon was styled with a long, high-waisted velvet skirt, embroidered with lacy motifs. Although her daywear married romance with practicality, as always with Beccaria occasion dresses were the collection\u2019s stronger point. Luscious velvet was the fabric of choice for Victorian-inspired turquoise wrap dresses and for richly cut-out-embroidered numbers fit for a Chekhov heroine.

It\u2019s a cool friend giving you a fashion tip, not a data-produced bit of jargon that promises you a better you.

And The White Crow, a biopic focused on the Russian dancer\u2019s impoverished childhood and 1961 escape from the Soviet Union, directed by Ralph Fiennes, is due in early 2019. In the fashion sphere, Max Mara creative director Ian Griffiths used Nureyev, Fonteyn, and ballet in general as jumping-off points. \u201cI was thinking about the relationship between Nureyev and Fonteyn,\u201d Griffiths said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dynamic rather applicable to Max Mara, because it was all about contrast: youth and experience, the anima and the animus, the masculine side of femininity, and the feminine side of masculinity.\u201d Griffiths focused on the duo\u2019s more intimate backstage and rehearsal moments, rather than referencing the grand costumes and the star wattage of staged performances. Hence his attention to leggings layered one over the other, rolled-sleeve cache-coeurs and d\u00e9bardeurs, and tees often knotted in front or on one side. While Nureyev\u2019s style inspired a focus on soft masculine tailoring (accented by a velvet rendition of his signature trilby hat and a cashmere version of his utilitarian boots), Fonteyn\u2019s provided the ethereal chiffons and georgettes. The collection\u2019s relaxed sensibility was highlighted in the roomy round shapes of the classic cocoon coats, sometimes layered under breezy organza dusters in matching shades of powder pink, lilac, or copper. Softly tailored blazers worn with wide-leg trousers exuded an unstructured yet elegant ease, emphasized also by long skirts in fluid jersey or silk georgette, which looked as graceful as they were practical.

It was founded in the 1920s by a visionary Czech entrepreneur, Jan Nehera, a pioneer in vertically integrating retail operations and advanced manufacturing production with smart marketing promotion; it was a groundbreaking process, one that predates the business model employed by today\u2019s luxury conglomerates. Nehera took advantage of the textile tradition rooted in his hometown of Prostejov, where in 1858 the first-ever European ready-to-wear factory was opened. He produced good-quality, tailored daywear, and his forward-thinking approach proved so successful that in less than a decade he was able to open a network of 130 retail shops across northern Europe and Africa. World War II put a brusque end to Nehera\u2019s activities; production was stopped at the company\u2019s facilities. After many twists and turns, the label was relaunched in 2014; its aesthetic bears a well-considered, pared-down elegance reminiscent of a certain modernist architecture. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the great architect and theorist Adolf Loos, whose essay \u201cOrnament and Crime\u201d advocated the superiority of smooth, clean surfaces against fin de si\u00e8cle maximalism, was born in Brno, now belonging to the Czech Republic. Nehera\u2019s repertoire is grounded in elevated workwear and comfortable utility dressing; designed by an international team based in Bratislava, it exudes a serene yet dynamic feel that comes across as rather cool. Pre-Fall was informed by the working lives of women artists, like Canadian-born American abstract painter Agnes Martin. Her daily routine in the atelier, where comfort as well as a certain dressed-down sophistication was needed, provided the inspiration for a wardrobe of functional, versatile pieces, rich in smartly designed details. Square-cut padded cotton cabans came with slitted armholes to remove the sleeves when required; long, masculine, apron-like shirts had attached elasticated garters to roll up the sleeves and free the hands. The same attitude of enabling unencumbered gestures was infused in a roomy Bauhaus-inspired maxi caftan, while a chunky knit cardigan incorporated long tabard-like panels to be wrapped around for extra warmth. Juxtapositions, layering, and loose-fit proportions infused with a sense of ease were the collection\u2019s leitmotifs; the color palette was kept restrained yet warm and comforting: rich browns, honey, and an elegant hue of Prussian blue. It made for a remarkably fresh, honest take on utilitarian style\u2014elegantly unassuming, optimistic, practical, and artsy in equal measure."}, {"Designer": "Nili Lotan", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "We\u2019re not going to name any names here, but Nili Lotan just learned she\u2019s the top-selling designer in one of New York\u2019s most beloved stores. If you\u2019re familiar with her collections, you might understand why: Lotan\u2019s clothes have a built-in nonchalance and a touch of \u201970s edge, so even her simplest blouses and army pants make you feel a little bit cooler. They\u2019re easy, truly wearable clothes with attitude\u2014in fact, they have more attitude than a lot of the trendier, more complicated stuff out there. But it\u2019s still a surprise to hear that number one statistic, considering how many New Yorkers likely haven\u2019t heard Lotan\u2019s name before. It goes to show just how powerful a designer\u2019s own community can be; her cult following is so dedicated, it can support her brand without the flash of marketing campaigns or Instagram ads. Lotan isn\u2019t resting on her laurels, though. Instead, as her business expands\u2014both in her own stores (she now has three) and in retailers around the world\u2014she\u2019s also expanding her repertoire. Until now, her collections could be pretty evenly divided: On one side, there were her day pieces, like army pants, cashmere knits, button-downs, and cargo jackets, and on the other, her evening slip dresses and glossy faux furs. Pre-Fall marked the first time she really explored the middle ground in between, introducing what can best be described as \u201celegant casual\u201d dressing: khaki trousers and double-breasted blazers, suede minis, fluid trenchcoats, textured-silk blouses, and a handful of new high-rise, tapered trousers. The \u201970s references came through in the little vests (worn with three-piece suits or over leopard blouses), not to mention the platform boots she styled it all with. (Lotan doesn\u2019t make shoes, but we have a feeling she\u2019s been thinking about it.) Fans of her camouflage hoodies and raw-edge silk dresses needn\u2019t worry. Those categories were well represented in this collection; in fact, Lotan recently launched a core collection of hoodies, army pants, and cargo jackets that will be available year-round. They\u2019re the same pieces she launched her collection with in 2003, and they remain consistent best-sellers. \u201cThis is a whole business in and of itself,\u201d she revealed. \u201cIt\u2019s what my customers wear on the weekends and to run errands around the city.\u201d She also debuted a collection of head-to-toe cashmere sets, with joggers, pullovers, turtlenecks, and shell tops. Plenty of women will wear them on a long-haul flight, but Lotan doesn\u2019t picture those items leaving your house; she sees them as the ultimate leisurewear.

Every collection he does has a cinematic narrative, unfolding like a black-and-white neorealist movie. For Pre-Fall, it involved the aforementioned blonde bombshell, melancholic and slightly despondent, walking by herself on a wintry beach wrapped in cashmere. The sea in winter was the theme underpinning the collection; hence, an abundance of blanket-like, generously cut double-wool coats and peacoats, mostly in navy blue with red and white Breton stripes. Their linings revealed golden foil trimmings for a touch of glamour, an element dear to the Italian designer. Worn with cropped, flared pants or with high-waisted matching miniskirts, they made for a practical yet rather cool, desirable proposal. The Marini\u00e8re references were kept light and not too literal, as in a series of striped oversize mohair jumpers, worn sensually off the shoulders. Sensuality is always at play with chez Dell\u2019Acqua; there\u2019s often a slightly erotic tension between opposites in his collections. Here, the sleek surfaces of vinyl miniskirts contrasted with lingerie-inspired black point d\u2019esprit blouses. Leopard-printed eco-furs clashed with bourgeois camel wrap coats in luxurious double cashmere, and flame-red side-slit pencil skirts were worn with ingenue-ish black tulle ankle socks and high-heeled pumps with humongous red bows.

Denims were offered in two new abstract prints, and a black-and-white palm pattern was in line with the endless-summer theme seen everywhere for Spring.

Abloh, who has no shortage of other commitments, stayed within a familiar zone, iterating just enough to maintain a degree of topical interest. Logo pennant sweaters, coordinated sweatsuits, and pleated cheerleader-style skirts corresponded most directly to the story line, whereas dressier suits, embroidered denim, and floral pajamas were among the pieces that could be interpreted as necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s DIY, make the look yourself,\u201d said the designer. This was his approach with the new statement bag; its formal shape and swiveling hardware contrasted by graffiti tags and scrawls that put a self-referential (Cash Inside) spin on Stephen Sprouse\u2019s collectible collaboration for Louis Vuitton. Another version, covered in optical cubes, nodded to the monogram of a brand whose name rhymes with toy card. Still, surface treatments were generally well developed, whether the hand-beaded varsity patches, the quilted logo on the back of down jackets, or the aforementioned cube pattern in faux fur.

The feminine/masculine tempo was set by a back and forth between floral and check. And their this-season decorative chorus was drawn from the personal style of Janis Joplin and the graphic modernism of Reid Miles, the designer best known for his Blue Note Records cover art. Arranged together, these ingredients made for a fresh-feeling remix of the interesting ease these designers are so adept at expressing in clothing. Mishmash intarsia knit sweater-vests with blown-up argyle diamonds and stripes provided nubbly, tactile texture when styled over the long and asymmetrical-hemmed viscose main events. There was an excellent section of quilted pants, skirts, high-bombers, and smock coats sometimes accessorized with sou\u2019wester or bucket hat that all came irregularly pixelated by a pattern inspired by bohemian souvenir Moroccan tiling. T-shirt dresses in loud mismatched panels of striped cotton reflected that direct and punchy Reid Miles aesthetic. A very cool prettified track top in cotton jersey featured a drawstring at the waist and a ruffle-edged hem. Its matching pant was patched with cleverly inverted pocket details and inserts of shape-defining ribbing. This was a Preen Line collection whose apparently ad hoc improvisation and twist belied the long-honed compositional mastery behind it.

Back in New York after a year\u2019s worth of shows in Paris, the designers swapped the elaborate embroideries and \u201cworked\u201d surfaces they had recently favored for the straightforward appeal of denim and the codes of American sportswear. It was a fairly radical volta-face, not entirely embraced, though the designers say the denim has received a positive response from retailers. For Pre-Fall, which they presented by appointment in their showroom today, they continued in this new vein, weaving in some of their own familiar codes, as in the bra-cup detailing from their earliest outing as Parsons grads. That was a smart move; the slip dresses that they layered over skinny, ankle-zip flares or full trousers, or showed under an oversize raw felt topcoat, gave this collection a sensuality typically associated with Proenza Schouler that their runway show was missing. Negotiating the desire for newness and the dependability of familiarity is the task of any successful designer. To be sure, it\u2019s a fine balance. When something works as well as the tie-dyed stretch-velvet long dress they did for Fall 2018\u2014sold out everywhere, they reported\u2014there\u2019s no sense in fighting it. Here, they showed tie-dyed shirts in new colorways with pleated knit skirts. They\u2019re likely to perform just as well. Tie-dye is everywhere, but these look identifiably Proenza Schouler. Making something as universal as a blazer into a signature is a harder project. Hernandez and McCollough\u2019s efforts here revolved around deconstruction. The lapels of a checked blazer, for example, were semi-detached and could be wrapped artfully around the neck like a scarf. The jacket looked boss paired with an equally deconstructed chunky knit sweater and chambray acid-wash full-leg trousers.

Founder Marcus Wainwright divided the collection into three main themes: tailoring, dresses, and prints. Sounds simple enough, but within each category are joyous little surprises, like the trailing adjustable ribbon straps on a dot slip dress or the contrast paneling on a bordeaux houndstooth suit. Everything is imbued with a multipurpose spirit, with large ecru-color buttons appearing on trousers, dresses, and skirts that allow wearers to conceal or reveal as they wish. With fine-rib tees in neon green and floaty beach dresses in ivory, this collection is one that allows its women to feel like a slightly more polished version of themselves\u2014better but not oppressively so. It makes sense, then, that a yellow knit reads kind in intarsia. Who wouldn\u2019t want clothes that are kind to the body?

All the outerwear classics\u2014a strong-shoulder camel coat, a buttery leather aviator jacket, a sand-colored double-breasted blazer\u2014are in the the new offering, mostly modeled on menswear Lauren has had in his own closet for decades. With its gently oversize and cozy proportions, the shearling toggle coat is a nice addition to that repertoire of familiar silhouettes. The designer has never been shy about leaning into his equestrian sensibilities, and for Pre-Fall he\u2019s bringing back the jodhpur. This time around, though, the coordinating shoe isn\u2019t a knee-high riding boot but rather the brand\u2019s city-ready lace-up ankle bootie. Lauren has a knack for transposing classic sportswear tropes for evening. The fashion world was given a showstopping reminder of that at the CFDA Awards last month when Jennifer Lopez wafted onto the podium to pick up her fashion icon statuette dressed in a coral crop top and billowing ball skirt. \u201cI grew up in the Bronx, so of course I had to wear Ralph Lauren tonight,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cI know he understands a girl\u2019s love for crop tops, ponytails, sparkles, and a little drama.\u201d (Needless to say, the phone was ringing off the hook at the Ralph Lauren mansion on Madison Avenue with inquiries about the terrific look the next morning.) Though there are no crop tops in the new collection, there are plenty of eye-catching, late-summer party looks to suit the needs of glamorous women like Lopez. The traditional American flannel shirt is given a radical makeover via a work shirt that\u2019s cut from lam\u00e9. That shimmering plaid treatment works well on a floor-length slip dress too.

Allegra developed the collection around the notion of urban camouflage. \u201cThere\u2019s something about climate change and Zika [virus] awareness that made me feel like our clothing in some ways is worn now as protective gear,\u201d she said of the military-inspired silhouettes she was drawn to this season. The new creative direction filtered down to fabrications and functionality. Standouts included the mesh anorak that Allegra designed as the pivotal piece of the collection, in a tight cotton woven that took the colors of the camo tie-dye deftly, and detailing like a hood, zips, and pulls that played with its layering appeal. Her best-selling easy pant was updated with a cargo pocket, and silk twills took on new whisper dyes that imparted just a hint of color. The palette of the camouflage was anchored by a deep ink and bright peony, wearable through summer and fall. Also notable was the interplay of indigo on a transitional lightweight cotton trench and other essential layers. Inspired by an ikat print from the designer\u2019s youth, it was one of a few small steps down a newer, more expansive design path that felt directional but still in lockstep with what Allegra does best.

Shot in Rome\u2019s Accademia di Belle Arti, the lookbook features unretouched images of 23 art students from around the world, each photographed in a look of their choosing. There\u2019s no hair, no makeup; the students posed for the shoot as they are, representing a large swath of artistic endeavors, from the fashion design student Chiara Volpe to the illustrator Ilaria de Sanctis. \u201cI am looking at Red Valentino as a new community\u2014creative minds and authentic individuals that can interpret and see a collection in their own way,\u201d says Piccioli. That\u2019s an interesting concept; of course, only the most well-off students could afford Red Valentino. For the lucky ones who can, this was a compelling collection. Ideas of toughness and romance are often at the root here; this season, the lineup was distilled to a mostly black, red, and blush palette with an underlying Black Swan motif.

Wing embroideries and delicate peony-print dresses contrasted with tough leather jackets and pointed-toe kitten heels, and the brand\u2019s supersweet point d\u2019esprit frocks were given a sexy edge with one shoulder or a sheer skirt.

Silhouettes were figure hugging and sleek, with slinky draped minidresses in stretchy jersey showing plenty of leg. Tailoring was offered in strong-shouldered, powerfully cut suits, the blazer often worn alone on bare skin, as in a double-breasted, leopard-print example, or over tweed ultra-miniskirts tightly wrapped with black leather buckled belts. \u201cIt\u2019s an aristo-metal look,\u201d said Moratti. Indeed. While there wasn\u2019t much range in the offering, the message was definitely reinforced loud and clear, showing admirable conviction. Animalier-print leggings worn with a jacquard lam\u00e9 sweater with bell sleeves; sleek sequined tuxedos; shorter-than-short, body-con minidresses draped in multiple iterations\u2014they all looked perfectly believable for a confident, heavy metal\u2013loving girl-about-town.

With its high Edwardian-style collar and billowing sleeves, a blush-hue, delicately embroidered dress looked fit for a fairy tale. Another subtle shift came in the fabrics that Acra used. Typically, we see a lot of chiffon here, but this season she liked the look of velvet, which she worked into a standout, off-the-shoulder dusty pink gown prettily decorated with a matching rose.

The punchy suits, patterned day dresses, and tailored outerwear that have been the backbone of his label were all present, but he honed in on a new set of essentials. Jumpsuits with exposed zippers, cargo pockets, and wide belts were appealing additions, as were chunky color-blocked sweaters thrown over plaid blazers for a preppy take on the winter scarf. Lightweight trenchcoats layered on top of each other for lookbook purposes were strong enough to wear on their own, while floral blouses in muted tones of navy and peach kept things from seeming overly utilitarian. As a season, Pre-Fall rarely boasts extreme thrills or wild innovations, but neither do most real-world wardrobes. Rodriguez\u2019s strength is his ability to make standard pieces feel special through the use of small details. Odds are you already have a little black dress or leather jacket in your repertoire but Rodriguez\u2019s versions differ from the norm\u2014that belted jacket with a cocoon silhouette, contrast stitching, and waist tie is infinitely more interesting than the average bomber.

The signature Cavalli bravado was evident in familiar animalier motifs and a lush tropical design by Chilean artist Jos\u00e9 Pedro Godoy that Surridge transformed into both a jacquard and a print. But it was tempered by pinstripes and other suiting with subtle military references like khaki cargos and peacoats with peplumed hips. Surridge hails from menswear, and he\u2019s comfortable working in the tailoring lexicon. Sexiness, of course, is the most essential element of the Cavalli aesthetic. This is less familiar territory for Surridge, but he approached it in two distinct ways for Pre-Fall, both promising. The henna tattoo\u2013print body stockings were a fresh surprise, on trend market-wise and also in keeping with the skin-is-always-in sensibility of the house. A body-conscious, little LBD with a gilded chain-link strap was less unexpected but still hot.

Voluminous trapeze black opera coats in silk radzimir had huge practical pockets appliqu\u00e9d asymmetrically; a sporty mackintosh was square cut in unusual humongous proportions and made in a consistent techno fabric for a slightly idiosyncratic effect. The same vibe was also infused in an oversize jumpsuit in micro-checked wool, styled under a feminine, wispy tulle circle skirt for dramatic allure. Camouflage was given an off-kilter, artistic spin, becoming a painterly pattern for a protective pouf bomber in quilted silk satin.

The designer, who lived and worked here for years, wasn\u2019t thinking only of the hustle and bustle of Manhattan but also Long Island, the lucky city dwellers\u2019 escape. \u201cYou can be in the middle of it all and in just three hours [in the country],\u201d noted Rodebjer approvingly on the phone from the Swedish capital. \u201cIt\u2019s like having two different lifestyles at the same time.\u201d Contrasts and balances, these are prime motivators in the work of this Scandinavian designer, who takes a problem-solving approach to design. The first issue she tackled in this collection was how to dress for work when the subway stations are as hot as ovens and the humidity is so high that bare legs become glued to vinyl taxi seats. Her solution? Crisp cotton suits with wrap-and-tie jackets in a kimono-y shape. This grouping was mostly rendered in neutral tones; adding color and texture, respectively, were a naive floral print and fringed knits. A second grouping, mainly in white and orange, was made using more relaxed cottons. This story was beachier and hippie-r, and came with crafty bohemian details like tassels and embroideries, similar to those you might find flipping through issues of Diana Vreeland\u2013era Vogue. Rodebjer is celebrated for addressing real women\u2019s needs; she accesses those through muses. This season she was guided by three graces: the socialite Lee Radziwill, whose city polish she contrasted with the laid-back lifestyle (rather than the artwork) of Perle Fine and Mary Abbott, two female Abstract Expressionist painters from Long Island. It was difficult to make a connection between these specific artists and the festival-girl clothes on the racks. Easier to grasp was the connection between the beach and Long Island. The surprise in this collection were two vintage-inspired dresses. A neat, almost prim, sleeveless number with button-front detailing channeled Radziwill; the second, a draped-front \u201coccasion\u201d dress, nodded to the 1940s. \u201cIn Sweden,\u201d explained Rodebjer, you wear the same clothes \u201cfor everything, pretty much.\u201d It was in America that she was asked for party dresses. \u201cI was thinking of real occasions [this season], which I don\u2019t usually think of when I design. I usually do really fluid, lots-of-fabric kind of dresses, and I wanted to do something that was not body-hugging but still contoured your body in a way without being tight.\u201d Hence the dressed-up draped look, in which a throwback silhouette was combined with a modern, abstract print. It achieved Rodebjer\u2019s larger goal of creating a balance between opposites. Lagom lives on.

There was a natural fit between Ostoya\u2019s way of layering tones and textures together to create architectural effects on her canvases, and Getty\u2019s approach to building looks; meanwhile, Ostoya\u2019s sometimes-jarring palette provided this Getty collection with a welcome jolt. The emphasis on shades of orange was the first thing you noticed here: The layered orange tones and textures of a bias-cut satin gown worn with a camisole and cropped sweater made for one standout, highlighter-bright look, but the tangerine-hue grid-checked tailoring was a more unexpected hit. Ostoya also cued Getty to construct her patterns in an almost Cubist way\u2014to wit, the button-downs angled to one side, with twisted, dagger-edged collars. In one of the most overt nods to Ostoya\u2019s collaging, Getty conjured a fabulous patchwork trench, color-blocked throughout and featuring 3-D pockets.

She\u2019s among the few designers who use both real and fake fur in her collections; instead of picking a side, she\u2019s letting her customers choose for themselves. The real fur appeared in smaller doses, like the removable fox collar on a wool motorcycle jacket or a papaya knit trimmed with a single strip of fur, and she expanded her shearling offering with a plush buttercup chubby. Pre-Fall marks LaPointe\u2019s third season incorporating faux fluff into her collections, a decision that\u2019s likely expanded her customer base, particularly with younger shoppers. It may have played a part in her recent debut on Net-a-Porter, which is fur-free; her Resort collection just landed on the site, including a fluffy, ultra-soft cobalt faux jacket. On that note, color is still where LaPointe makes a big impact. Monochrome dressing has become a signature, from sporty-luxe cashmere pullovers and silk trousers to suede jackets and hand-embellished sequined skirts.

The slim, boot-cut suede trousers in citrus hues looked good, too; paired with ribbed turtlenecks or XL cardigans, they\u2019ll appeal to women of all ages, from LaPointe\u2019s It girl fans (like Kendall Jenner and Hailey Baldwin) to the ladies who shop her line at Bergdorf Goodman.

That was just what Paul Andrew, Salvatore Ferragamo\u2019s creative director, did for Pre-Fall, the color palette of which referenced a few sumptuous Bronzino paintings that are part of the museum\u2019s permanent collection. Their rich hues of paprika, dark green, and deep blue tinged the women\u2019s offering with a smooth vibrancy that also reverberated through the men\u2019s. While Andrew didn\u2019t look far for inspiration, Guillaume Meilland, menswear design director, went more exotic, fascinated by British expat Paul Bowles\u2019s sartorial eccentricity, which he referred to in the tailored ease of many of the propositions he envisioned. Yet both sets of references were balanced by a deep dive into the Ferragamo archives. \u201cWe\u2019re engaging with some of the iconic elements of the house\u2019s history and making them modern,\u201d said Andrew. While sourcing editorials and fashion shows from the \u201980s, he found images of an oversize coat that provided the template for most of the new proportions and roomy volumes he worked on, as in a generous double-cashmere wrapped overcoat belted with a sash, or in a boxy, enveloping caban with a long matching scarf in soft plaid mohair. Ferragamo\u2019s coed approach has proved so far rather consistent; Andrew and Meilland have a like-mindedness and a creative compatibility that seems genuine. Take, for example, one of the best looks of the collection, which was rich in great-looking outerwear. The starting point was a classic tailored car coat in houndstooth wool, which for men was proposed in a fresh new length, short and rather boxy, lightweight and unlined, worn with flannel tracksuit pants for elegant, linear comfort. For women, the coat was elongated and cinched at the waist, its checkered pattern slightly shrunken; patchwork suede sleeves and a removable hooded nylon collar were added as stylish yet functional details. It looked smart worn with slouchy knee-high boots that hybridized a cowboy boot and a biker boot. Here was obviously where Andrew\u2019s expertise in shoe design came to the fore; taking inspiration from the archival wooden lasts Salvatore Ferragamo used as prototypes for his studies on new shoe shapes, Andrew worked on an ankle boot wooden clog in soft leather, decorated with the updated Gancini buckle. \u201cClogs are both sophisticated in their shape and humble in the material,\u201d said Andrew. Well, if they\u2019re proposed in brightly colored ostrich leather, not quite.

Battaglia is a cool mix of poise and sensuality, which is perfectly replicated in her fashion choices, balanced between a quality that she defines as severe and almost chaste, and all-out glamorous sex appeal. Case in point: a \u201950s-inspired, candy pink suit that enhanced the body in all the right places, without revealing too much. While the plunging V-neckline and the ample round lapels drove attention to the d\u00e9colletage, the flounced jacket was fitted at the waist and cut short to emphasize the hips, tightly wrapped in a curvaceous pencil skirt and trimmed with another flounce for extra drama. To bring home her point, in the lookbook Battaglia wore the outfit herself. It made a convincing argument for her revealing/concealing fashion game. The collection mostly revolved around occasion dressing, or as the designer called it, dating dressing. Self-confident head-turners included a zebra-print eco-fur duster worn over a matching brassiere and a comely round-shaped midi skirt, and a sexy asymmetrically draped minidress in flame red lam\u00e9 with billowy sleeves and more-than-plunging neckline, slightly \u201980s disco in spirit. You won\u2019t go unnoticed wearing it. A believer in the seductive power of a power suit, the designer proposed a few good examples; they actually were the collection\u2019s best looks. Tailored with a deft hand, they came with double-breasted jackets, straight cut and neat in, say, a sumptuous fuchsia and red zebra-print silk cady, or else in a pajama version in fluid gold lam\u00e9.

Tiny florals and Indian block prints are the standard at Sea, but Pre-Fall felt like a sleeker, stronger departure for the brand. That tie-dye\u2014and the collection\u2019s other dominant print, a blurry leopard\u2014was one answer to the question the designers have been asking themselves for a while: How do you capture the spirit of Sea without eyelet or florals or frills? In addition to those prints, another answer lay in clean, elegant pieces with special tweaks or curious colors: A simple poplin dress had a dropped waist and a sash around the middle, for instance; a double-breasted suit came in chocolate brown, not black; and there was a ton of camel, taupe, whiskey, and burnt orange, all emerging color trends this season. Fans of Sea\u2019s day dresses (for many, they\u2019re the main draw) will still find exciting developments here. Monahan and Paolini noticed the trend for prairie dresses, so they introduced their own (highly wearable) versions, complete with high necklines, puff sleeves, and allover prints, from animal spots to a new wallpaper floral. We have a feeling they\u2019ll be best-sellers next May\u2014and you\u2019d be wise to pick yours up at Sea\u2019s dreamy Canal Street store.

Sustainable luxe is the mot d\u2019ordre today, and Ravizza has smartly adjusted. From a creative perspective, fur has become almost a decorative accent in her collections, instead of being the star of the show. For Pre-Fall, this approach was well in evidence through an expanded focus on practical outerwear; coats in cashmere or in thick Prince of Wales wool were cut with generous proportions for a protective feel. Boxy city coats came patchworked in different fabrications, often printed with animal patterns and sporting discreet mink collars and cuffs, while checkered wrap coats were lined in Mongolian lamb in contrasting tones, their efficient urban flair softened by a sensuous fluffy touch. Oversize piumini in bright colors referenced a more sporty vibe, with furry cuffs and collars treated as accessories to be added or removed according to mood.

For this Pre-Fall collection Julie de Libran remained true to this standard with new versions of the brand\u2019s beloved boilersuits, knitwear statement pieces, and some chic day-to-night dresses. But she also proposed clothes that introduced a more outdoorsy spirit. From a showroom staged with giant screens displaying digitally enhanced landscapes on loop (the work of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez, normally known for his runway show music production), the designer explained that she had been thinking about the necessity of travel to clear the mind\u2014or, if nothing more, to allow the mind to travel. \u201cIt\u2019s not about being safe; it\u2019s about exploring and trying new things,\u201d she said. With the full wardrobe on view, the strongest pieces were those that either had an adaptable aspect or that offered a signature point of differentiation to the elevated sportswear found elsewhere. A striped knit parka, for instance, had high impact; but it was also a natural fit for an evolving Rykiel ethos. Another nifty design split the construction of a sweater or jacket so that one sleeve was tailored while the other was loose and cape-like. Should this sound awkward or imbalanced, each version proved otherwise on the models, with the silhouette interestingly distributed between structure and flow. Versatility was the byword for a leather perfecto with an integrated yet removable shawl and a denim jacket with snaps up the sleeves; certainly, they made more sense than a safari-type suit with cargo pockets positioned down toward the ankles (for what it\u2019s worth, these were working pockets). The creative knitwear that is expected from Sonia Rykiel delivered the added component of sustainability this season. The studio made use of its extensive yarn inventory to develop upcycled trompe l\u2019oeil twinsets; only here, the striped top piece was tied around the shoulders as a \u201chalf sweater.\u201d Meanwhile, the cognitive dissonance of seeing a T-shirt with Sonia Rykiel Paris framing the image of cacti seemed less pronounced in the form of a stylized desert boot. Though chunky, they offered a fun foil for one of the season\u2019s graphic skirts, if not the knit-paneled sweatpants\u2014and a break from Rykiel\u2019s city gal platforms."}, {"Designer": "Sportmax", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Le Corbusier\u2019s famous Pavillon de l\u2019Esprit Nouveau, designed with Pierre Jeanneret as an innovative template for future housing projects and exhibited in 1925 at Paris\u2019s Exposition Universelle, was reproduced on the same scale in Bologna, Italy, in 1977.

This dialogue was particularly apparent in the outerwear offer, always a strong category for Sportmax, which was proposed in a variety of hybrids, where the concepts of transformation and versatility were central. A trenchcoat, cut with architectural precision in leather, was made flexible via a detachable front bib and zippered sleeves; it can morph into a long waistcoat to be worn over wide-leg fluid pants or feminine, figure-skimming dresses. Tailoring is at the core of the label\u2019s expertise; here its streamlined structure was tinged with a sporty allure and experimental play with fabrications and textures. A masculine city coat was cut in thick striped alpaca, which gave its precise shape a feel of comfort and ease; a blazer in navy wool presented a classic masculine-inspired front, while the back exposed the garment\u2019s inner construction, its seams and lining treated almost as decorative elements.

The brand\u2019s classic tweed jacket, which has been lightened up and deconstructed to feel more like a cardigan, came with exaggerated raffia trim.

Fascinated by De Chirico\u2019s aesthetic, Stella Jean wanted to pay homage to his multicultural roots, a theme always dear to the Haitian-Italian designer. She wittily called her Pre-Fall collection De Chirico Goes to Palm Beach. Jean was particularly inspired by the artist\u2019s nomadic spirit, as expressed in The Soothsayer\u2019s Recompense, a 1913 melancholic painting where a little steam train imperceptibly crosses the horizon, while the tiny silhouettes of two lonely palm trees stand as a symbol of an exotic destination. \u201cDe Chirico\u2019s father was a railway engineer,\u201d explained the designer, who had clearly done her homework. \u201cThat\u2019s why the train was a recurrent theme in his oeuvre. I loved the idea of how the paternal origins were celebrated, together with the desire of traveling abroad, flying away from the family roots, but then always coming back.\u201d The themes of m\u00e9tissage, migration, displacement and longing for a faraway homeland always resonate for Jean, daughter of a Haitian father and an Italian mother; they\u2019re inherent to her fierce aesthetic sense, rich in bold exotic references, blended into a strong decorative mix of patterns, symbols, and signifiers. For Pre-Fall, the palm trees of lush distant lands, as if almost metaphysical memories, were translated into bold geometric patterns for ankle-grazing billowing shirtdresses with pliss\u00e9 skirts, or in more streamlined silhouettes, as in linear pencil skirts paired with high-collared poplin shirts. A masculine checkered wool grisaille was hybridized with sinuous embroidered leaves, gracing cropped wide-leg pants or feminine schoolgirl-pleated skirts worn with abbreviated boxy peacoats. The conversation between masculine and feminine was the thread which held the free-form lineup together, where lengths, patterns, and silhouettes alternated in a spirited stylistic melting pot. Always open to give voice in her fashion practice to creative diversity, Stella Jean collaborated this season with the young street artist Pierre Andre Diedhiou, born in Rome to immigrant parents, who created a series of T-shirts for the collection from his label HISU, an acronym of Haiti Italy Senegal USA, places of origin of his extended multicultural family."}, {"Designer": "T by Alexander Wang", "Season": "Pre-Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "In the Alexander Wang universe, clubbing counts as both a sport and an everyday activity.

Subdued gowns like the black and white column dress covered in floral appliqu\u00e9 and a straightforward gray lace number were pretty albeit staid. The collection came to life when Shoji embraced the exuberance of his theme either through a literal interpretation of flowers or by experimenting with saturated color.

Apologies, Thom, if you dislike the wordplay. But as a continuation of his Spring \u201819, Pre-Fall once again riffs on American preppy codes through the tradition and fine execution of ready-to-wear, twisting classic tailoring and fabrics with a certain Parisian flair. Looks featured patchwork striped rep fabrics; varsity jackets that descended towards the knees; and patterns of ducks (replacing Hector the dog, apparently). Yet there was also delicate Lesage embroidery and handwoven tweed. The net effect was somewhat bipolar in its youthful-sophisticated duality; yet the clothes had all-ages appeal. As usual, experimental techniques coexisted with sartorial precision; the fraying that had resulted from washing certain fabrics felt eccentrically on-brand, as did the perfectly shrunken jackets and roomy men\u2019s coats. Browne emphasized his interest in a \u201chalf calf\u201d skirt length, saying, \u201cFor me it feels really strong and really young.\u201d Without prompt, he singled out an ample sack jacket and wide column dress that looked like an oversize pant leg, both in a peppery Donegal tweed, as the key statement of the collection. But certain sportier and evening looks were just as persuasive; from a jacket that had its bastings and linings on the outside, to a tunic embroidered with a silvery landscape scene that looked even more original when worn over an extra-long white shirt. Browne noted that while the pre-collections speak to reality compared to the high-impact, couture-approximate approach he favors for the runway, there remains a through line. \u201cIf [an idea] is strong in the women\u2019s collection, it doesn\u2019t go away\u2014it just might play out in items that are easier.\u201d Intentional or not, this seemed like an acknowledgement of the October show in which cheerful allusions to Cape Cod were destabilized with unhinged proportions, horror-movie-style masks, arms bound tight to bodies, and mismatched heels that were accidents waiting to happen. Here, white long underwear cuffed with the Thom Browne tricolor grosgrain was a harmless leitmotif\u2014night and day in comfort terms. Still, this reviewer was reminded of her high school uniform and the classmates who layered sweatpants under their kilts. Then as now, the combination was stylistically rebellious\u2014bunched-up leggings as a counterpoint to the sharply tailored investment pieces. Let\u2019s just say this sums up prep-\u00e0-porter.

Denim is an unlikely material for the trio; its rigidity would seem to resist the twisting and curving patterns they\u2019re known for. Indeed, in that Spring 2006 show, they spent a lot of their efforts on shredding and deconstructing denim, to give it a surprisingly supple hand. From this distance, a few of the more dramatic evening numbers look like dark horse contenders for awards season\u2014if there are any celebrity stylists out there reading this, they should give the collection a look. For Pre-Fall 2019, they returned to denim. This was done less in the spirit of our reissue-obsessed times (see the Versace tribute collection, see Marc Jacobs Grunge Redux), and more in the spirit of two other late-2010s fashion fixations: collaboration and upcycling. Stanley Casselman, an artist neighbor at Jersey City\u2019s Mana Contemporary, where the designers have their studio, is their collaborator for Fall 2019, a collection that will be shown in February. What you see in these photos is a prelude of sorts: The paint-splattered pieces are made from Casselman\u2019s own much-loved jeans. The other pieces in the small offering are patchworked together from new denim and vintage Levi\u2019s that the designers buy by the pound. Sliced into panels, the used Levi\u2019s are an excellent partner to Threeasfour\u2019s inventive patternmaking; the stiff, substantial hand of the denim creates compelling volumes through the hips and thighs of a sexy, zip-front jumpsuit, the sleeves of a wrap jacket, and their classic \u201cgeo pants,\u201d which kick out three-dimensionally above the hem. In the spirit of another current fashion phenomenon, they\u2019re planning a pop-up at the Chinatown Mall (where Eckhaus Latta just opened a store) on December 14.

That wasn\u2019t the case when Amy Smilovic put male models in her show for the first time, though, back in February of 2016. Her Tibi boys looked good (really good!) in their Lurex sweaters and slouchy trousers, but, as it turned out, the market wasn\u2019t quite ready for them. This was a full year before Gucci and Balenciaga started the domino-effect trend of combined shows, mind you; it\u2019s an understatement to say things have changed since then. Fashion Week schedules are now a veritable free-for-all; our ideas about \u201cgendered\u201d fashion are evolving; and men\u2019s and women\u2019s tastes are starting to merge and overlap, just like the collections on the runway. Right on cue, Smilovic put guys on the runway again for Spring 2019, this time in unisex pastel suits. Two-and-a-half years after her initial experiment, the response was so strong that she was able to launch Tibi\u2019s first-ever straight-up menswear collection, which drops exclusively at Ssense later this month. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on it quietly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew we\u2019d gotten it to the right place when all the women in the office wanted to wear the men\u2019s stuff.\u201d We have a feeling Smilovic\u2019s team will be excited to wear the men\u2019s Pre-Fall looks, too, namely the boxy denim blazers, relaxed trousers, silky \u201cbasketball shorts,\u201d and checked suits. It was easy to picture a Tibi girl wearing the shorts with a camisole and Pre-Fall\u2019s shearling-lined flip-flops, for instance, or maybe she\u2019ll pair the men\u2019s denim jacket with the slick nylon joggers from the women\u2019s side. They looked like leather from afar, so it\u2019s likely that guys will want them, too. Or maybe they\u2019ll pick up the \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d emerald shearling coat or XXL leather tote. Girls and guys alike will want Smilovic\u2019s new high-top sneaker, which melded the sleek lines of an ankle boot with the thick, curvy rubber sole of a trainer. Smilovic has described her clothes as simple, yet \u201cnot average\u201d\u2014i.e., wearable pieces with special tweaks. That ethos applied here whether you call it women\u2019s, men\u2019s, unisex, whatever. She said she wanted to inject a bit of humor, too: The flared-out strapless dress was styled over trousers, for instance, and the stretchy, sculpted m\u00e9lange knits came in a surprisingly sweet mint green.

They didn\u2019t simply borrow their color palette from India, nor did they reinterpret the sari or some other wardrobe item. Instead, their research led them to the dressing traditions of the Rabari women, whose clothes often feature braided trims and smocking. That inspired TSE to develop its own ribbon-smocked knits; incredibly fine pointelle stitches; and meticulous lacework\u2014each a complex process that took many weeks (or months) to perfect with its factories.

Across the river, some scattered violence was breaking out; here the vibe was tout va bien. Jacket pockets shaped like the Eiffel Tower were hard to miss on a variety of sweaters, while other pieces were color-blocked in softer tones of the tricolor flag. For light dresses and pajama pairings, she drew her own tourist maps with pastel city blocks echoing the tones of Monet\u2019s Waterlilies. Other illustrations included characters from the old regime and the portrait of a ringleted blonde who we\u2019ll call Tsumarie Antoinette. The designer\u2019s visit to Le Petit Trianon left an impression; she extracted such regal signifiers as ermine, now a peachy faux fur, and softened some of the fuller period shapes into reversible coats that featured painterly patterns on one side and Champagne-beige on the other. For all the fancy leanings, everyday attire kept the offering realistic. There were coordinating activewear leggings worn under dresses (Chisato encourages you to actually wear them for yoga); wide-legged jeans and overalls with trompe l\u2019oeil bows paneled into the denim; and a ruffle-neck base layer that could be styled under just about anything. One thing there wasn\u2019t: irony. Indeed, at any other moment, this homage would read like a love letter; even more so given the fantasy perception of Paris in the minds of Japanese (the flip side being the well documented shock known as Paris Syndrome when the experience doesn\u2019t match up).

A Diptyque candle burned in the foyer of Galerie Perrotin in the Marais; Taverniti was gracious and chatty as usual, but he seemed more at ease. His brand is well-established at this point, and stocked widely, but the conviction with which he described the collection was the main reason for his demeanor: \u201cI\u2019ve scaled back,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it got too big, and I was trying to satisfy too many people.

It was a statement of the way he has adapted the codes of the house to the modern world with intelligent focus and grace. In this raw space, the refinement of the clothes stood out with added drama as the pianist Ang\u00e8le David-Guillou performed her haunting composition \u201cDesert Stilts\u201d on a gleaming black Steinway to the accompaniment of lively strings. \u201cI love the culture of Japan,\u201d declared Piccioli at a morning preview of the festive evening presentation. \u201cIt\u2019s so modern with a sense of tradition which is romantic, not nostalgic\u2014it\u2019s part of the present.\u201d In a moment where cultural sensitivities in the fashion world are on high alert, Piccioli explored the subtleties of his host country with his characteristic soulful elegance, particularly the concept of ma\u2014the space or interval between objects, or the telling pause in a conversation\u2014and of wabi-sabi, which finds beauty in imperfection. \u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by this idea,\u201d Piccioli explained, \u201cWestern culture is about symmetry, perfection, static beauty, while wabi-sabi is more close to the idea of harmony, of inner grace. Time goes by and it adds, it doesn\u2019t take away. It\u2019s really interesting for this moment\u2014in the past, beauty was perfection, but I really feel beauty is about diversity, that this idea of wabi-sabi is very modern in this moment.\u201d Piccioli is also drawn to the Japanese art of kintsugi, of repairing the cracks of broken porcelain with a molten gold effect that adds new layers of beauty, \u201cso the most broken pieces become the most precious\u2014the opposite to Western culture. Time adds something to beauty.\u201d And what designer could fail to be moved by a culture that, as Piccioli explained, celebrates \u201cthe symbolic act of dressing up. People in the street dress like a ceremony, like a ritual\u201d? On the designer\u2019s mood boards and in his exquisitely produced collection inspiration books were such East-West juxtapositions as a kintsugi vase and a Piero della Francesca fresco in an Italian church, or Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Lady With an Ermine with an exquisite ancient red lacquered Japanese figure. (Renaissance art also appeared in the purses produced in collaboration with Undercover\u2019s Jun Takahashi, which will only be sold in Valentino\u2019s Tokyo flagship store, but more widely available runway collaborations included puffer jackets designed for Moncler and the playfully surreal self-portraiture of the 21-year-old artist Izumi Miyazaki that appeared on loose dresses and parkas.) Those mood board images appeared alongside photographs of iconic dresses from Mr. Valentino\u2019s archive\u2014Brooke Shields in \u201980s red gazar ruffles like an unfurling rose; the \u201990s runway queen Yasmeen Ghauri in a fabled commedia dell\u2019arte ball gown with a skirt made of lozenges of solid tulle ruffles in vibrant color; a flawless column of white crepe spliced by black crescent moons. Piccioli maintained that he wanted to \u201ckeep the prettiness and the romanticism, the codes of the house,\u201d but then apply the notion of wabi-sabi to those clothes to bring them firmly into today\u2019s world. This meant that those airy silks seemed to have been crushed in the hand. Once-vibrant floral prints were reimagined in red over-dyed on black, and the house\u2019s signature ruffles were translated into flounces of mohair knit tumbling down a sweater scattered with self-color silk florets, while fronds of ostrich fluttered over the over-scale sleeves of a nylon bomber jacket or a man\u2019s bucket hat. That Ghauri dress became a black and white teddy bear coat as light as thistledown. The sunray pleats of a \u201970s gown were intriguingly applied to a man\u2019s suit and shirt, and the detail on a tight \u201980s cocktail dress was reworked into a top cut loose and free as a T-shirt. A voluminous opera coat, meanwhile, became a trenchcoat, inset with traceries of filmy black lace but grounded with hefty Doc Martens boots in black or scarlet, ensuring that even the most fragile of dresses was ready to face the mean streets. As the spectacular finale of scarlet dresses fluttered by, a storm of red rose petals fluttered from the ceiling and the crowd went wild. Backstage, as he greeted playful Dynel-wigged influencers and chic local clients, Piccioli was thinking about the next collection.

The collection\u2019s sock bag with its coin-purse clasp is another nod in the direction of Martin Margiela, who did something similar with a leather glove 20 years ago.

Amber Valletta came out last in a replica of the bare-down-to-there gown she wore at Donatella\u2019s Spring 2000 show\u2014the one where she found her mojo, in the wake of her brother\u2019s tragic death. This time, the palm print was replaced by Jim Dine\u2019s hearts, a nod to work Gianni commissioned from the artist for his New York residence. The Dine hearts were one print among a panoply, and they seem destined to be the collection\u2019s stars, recognizable and collectible in equal measure\u2014Adut Akech\u2019s hearts on denim especially. Over the years Donatella presented Versus, the \u201clittle sister\u201d line to Versace, in New York a handful of times. She feels a kinship with the place, and to make it clear she negotiated with the city for the rights to use Milton Glaser\u2019s famed \u201cI love NY\u201d logo, which was mashed up with the familiar medusa motif on a see-now-buy-now T-shirt. The front row was crowded with a long line of stars: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, Bradley Cooper, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Uma Thurman, Mary J. Blige, and assorted other celebrities who will wear Atelier Versace on red carpets around the world. But to get to that $2 billion number, Versace is going to have to sell a lot more than big-ticket gowns; she\u2019s going to have to engage and activate the kids.

The famous banana-leaf wallpaper was a fitting backdrop for the colorful new collection that was partly a celebration of Glemaud\u2019s Caribbean roots. If you\u2019re familiar with the flags of the archipelago, then you\u2019ll likely recognize the most vibrant notes in the palette (the intarsia red, black, and blue dress riffed on Antigua and Barbuda\u2019s flag, for example), while soft, pastel knits called to mind the brightly painted architecture of the islands. The designer has been incorporating crochet into his repertoire over the last few seasons\u2014his flared crochet pants have become a bestseller\u2014and used the technique to flattering effect on A-line maxi dresses that skimmed the hip and the waist. There were flirty takeaways in that homespun direction (see the adorable cropped cardigans and bandeau tops), and other fun transitional pick-me-ups, including graphic black-and-white mink bucket hats and berets in Rasta colors, the brand\u2019s first foray into accessories. Prior to designing this collection, Glemaud had been reading Love Saves the Day, Tim Lawrence\u2019s evocative survey of New York\u2019s 1970s dance music scene. Though this latest offering was hardly a tribute to the last days of disco, the feel-good factor and a sense of togetherness about the clothes was inescapable and infectious. Perhaps the most universally recognizable and uplifting flag reference in the lineup came through in the gigantic rainbow fox-fur stole that was wrapped around a gorgeous long-haired male model.

That\u2019s very Victoria Beckham, too\u2014setting women practical examples of one accessory that can change things up in multiple contexts. Or, on the other hand, just putting on something simple yet definitive and going out and about with the family. As she did when she wore the wide-leg, high-waisted, bird\u2019s-eye tweed pantsuit on Sunday, January 6, to go to the Kent & Curwen breakfast-time menswear show with husband David and son Brooklyn. You can\u2019t see much tailoring in this lookbook, strangely, but suffice to say, female attendees that day hardly got past the \u201cHappy New Year\u201d before asking VB what her suit was. You\u2019ll have to take it as read\u2014or Google the occasion\u2014that she has nailed the \u201970s pantsuit look at the ideal moment. In other news: There are plenty of carryovers from her London show, which went down well for Spring, like the camisole top with which Stella Tennant made an entrance. Now it\u2019s in the neckline of a fitted black midi dress, amalgamated into a pajama-striped jumpsuit, as well as being a stand-alone, worn under a black pantsuit. What\u2019s nice about Beckham is how much she\u2019s a boot-is-a-boot, a touser-is-a-trouser woman. In a world where so much verbiage is sloshed around to dress up what are, basically, just clothes, it\u2019s refreshing to talk to someone who speaks about clothes and how to wear them, and cares only about designing what women respond to. Her secret weapon is that this unpretentious pragmatism is backed up by interesting, deftly chosen fabrics, again not really appreciable in this lookbook. There is what the eye sees in terms of styling, but it\u2019s what the hand touches and how a thing fits and flows on a body that converts an idea into a luxury that women will actually buy.

The basketball shorts looked surprisingly wearable, too; they\u2019re meant for a blazer or a chunky sweater, not the actual court.

Her label, built on her imaginative wonderland inhabited by creatures out of a vintage children\u2019s book, has grown to the point where she\u2019s been courted by various fashion companies to be part of their stables of creative thoroughbreds. They clearly see opportunities for expansion in that wonderland. So, recently, the designer jumped ship, joining an Italian industrial fashion group with strong production expertise. The change of pace was immediately evident for Pre-Fall, presented in a new showroom decorated, Vivetta-style, like a flat, with retro furniture, romantic flea market finds, and pink chinoiserie wallpaper. The collection seemed perfectly at ease here, as did the designer, whose family house is apparently replete with whimsical antiques: \u201cI was inspired by an 18th-century Aubusson tapestry that hung in my father\u2019s home,\u201d she said, explaining the collection\u2019s rather peculiar imagery. The medieval scene of the French tapestry depicted a romantic encounter between an aristocratic cape-clad damsel and her handsome chevalier in a lush leafy garden, feted by jumping rabbits, butterflies, and falcons. Vivetta had the bestiary migrating as printed motifs on ruched inserts for silk crepe dresses in shades of baby blue and candy pink; a storm of butterflies landed on a languid black dress, with sensuous \u201940s-inspired fluid lines. The army of rabbits hopped on an oversize electric blue piumino with an eco-fur collar; an unexpected appearance on a jacquard knitted pencil skirt was made by a zebra, whose pattern also graced a stunning number in emerald green velvet d\u00e9vor\u00e9 with a plunging neckline held in place by a butterfly crystal brooch. It definitely looked like red carpet material. Frilly cheerfulness sometimes hides a dark lining: Vivetta showed a weakness for hard punk imagery. She had the Lady From the Tapestry undergoing a plastic-surgery-like metamorphosis, transforming her aristo portrait into that of an eccentric punk maiden, printed on orange dayglow sweatshirts or knitted on jacquard wool jumpers.

What does a Warm girl wear when she needs to dress up but the air is salty and it\u2019s too hot to even think about wearing anything constricting? Beattie\u2019s answers included a group of jumpsuits, midi skirts, and dresses in a hammered-silk floral that mixed black, gold, and bronze, so you can wear virtually any color shoes.

The charm of a Warm dress is typically in its day-to-night flexibility, but those were among the fanciest pieces Beattie has done\u2014ditto the ivory and black jacquard dresses with color-blocked hibiscus florals.

Y\u2019s Black always showcases special handcrafted techniques, while Y\u2019s Pink is always about creative statement; but the particulars change from season to season. This collection showed noticeable effort on both counts. Regarding the former, arrangements of Surrealist hands and eyes in shiny grayscale beading and embroidery emerged from shirts, jackets, and coats. It was obvious they had been realized by hand (Shanagar, the Mumbai-based embroidery company responsible for the work, has a long list of fashion clients). And they complemented the clean lines of each garment with a mystic element that was open to interpretation. Relative to these delicate declarations, the other Y\u2019s Black grouping made a 180-degree turn towards humble. Coats and jackets in a denim jacquard simulated boro, a 19th-century patchwork technique that became popular in Japan when people couldn\u2019t afford full rolls of fabric. The end result was artisanal and nonetheless finessed. A few sharper bicolor/bi-fabric looks, plus the pieces in deep red\u2014supposedly the first time such a head-turning hue has appeared in the collection\u2014suggested that the design studio continues to reconsider the limits of its comfort zone. As for the Y\u2019s Pink portion, cape and poncho volumes and sleeves that attached to shirts with oversize buttons might not sound exciting, but will look sufficiently cerebral as part of an everyday wardrobe. The photos fail to capture the visual interest of the multicolored textured coats in Indian jacquards that were the focus of Yohji Yamamoto\u2019s Fall 2000 collection.

On the same note, a pair of satin boxer shorts showing plenty of legs were balanced by a round-sleeved white jacket, a sort of progressive version of a tuxedo, worn with a white shirt and a little black bow at the collar. The contrast between masculine and feminine accents had a rather sexy vibe. Vauthier indulged his love for glamorous flourishes in a series of ruffled numbers likely to make Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, and all his showbiz clients swoon. \u201cI worked with Maison Lemari\u00e9 in developing the technicality of ruffles. We came up with some pretty incredible shapes,\u201d he said. Indeed. Ruffles became inventive collars, sleeves, blouses, or imaginative minidresses, sinuous and undulating in silk satin, or sculpted and substantial in taffeta. A gorgeous cloud of black ruffled tulle was actually a flimsy long-sleeved top, grounded by a pencil-thin pair of silk capri pants. Tracing the plunging d\u00e9colletage of an animal-printed minidress, ruffles were cut elliptically, suggesting a dramatic pair of wings. The designer also worked on a more fluid and sensual silhouette, at times a bit androgynous, as in a few sharply tailored pantsuits. They were inspired by Fran\u00e7oise Hardy, the moody French chanteuse who had one of the coolest personal styles of the late \u201960s. Hardy was also on the soulful soundtrack\u2014quite a departure from the designer\u2019s usually stronger musical tastes. \u201cIn this moment all I want is chic and softness and un peu de po\u00e9sie,\u201d Vauthier said. \u201cWe designers are like barometers. It\u2019s absolutely not the time to go for an aggressive approach.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Alexis Mabille", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "A packed schedule often necessitates visiting a designer backstage before the show instead of after. The upshot is that this spoils the surprise. Such was the case at Alexis Mabille, where dresses in fuchsia lace, chartreuse satin, and a gleaming turquoise radzimir silk were revealed to the crowd as a gradual buildup that began in black. Calling the collection Rainbow Splash, the designer was intrepid in his matchup of shades and silhouettes. \u201cEvery color has its own energy,\u201d he said. Accordingly, he moved through different moods as well: mature yet modern from a deep blue spencer jacket and gown skirt; ingenue and party ready from a handkerchief frock in lipstick pink encircled in a spray of tulle. Gold may not qualify as a color; yet this grouping was suitably glitzy. Alas, the pull of pattern evidently proved too strong, hence pleated stripes, a floral-print lam\u00e9 organza, and an outsize arrangement of hand-painted flowers that sprouted with dimensional embroidery. One particularly diva-esque gown combined a glistening blue-black sheath with a yellow duchesse-satin cape that rounded inward like a deflated hot-air balloon. By contrast, when that same brilliant yellow was pitched against coral as a guipure, the freshness came through. While Mabille has always taken a liberal approach to hue, his connection of \u201cfreedom of color\u201d with \u201cfreedom of thought\u201d helped ensure a spectrum of options for those who gravitate towards his designs. To close the show, he presented three white gowns; he insisted weren\u2019t destined for brides, but they nonetheless suggested his overly glorified view of femininity with emphasis on the male gaze. \u201cI like this sense of women wanting to be objects of desire, but at the same time, they don\u2019t care.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Armani Priv\u00e9", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "The models in today\u2019s Armani Priv\u00e9 show walked to the score from Bernardo Bertolucci\u2019s The Conformist from 1970. A representative confirmed that this was in homage to the Italian director, who passed away in November. There was symbolism to this maestro-salutes-maestro gesture\u2014a testament to their respective bodies of work. But the music also enhanced an elegant, sweeping cinematic style that, to varying degrees, permeates the Armani Priv\u00e9 collections season after season. Within a series of gilded salons located off the Place Vend\u00f4me, the atmosphere felt closer to the idealized, indeed, cinematic haute couture experience than the previous venue with its impersonal size. Here, models moved ultra-slowly, which afforded ample opportunity to take in (or take pictures of) Armani\u2019s translation of Parisian high fashion. With Uma Thurman, Michelle Dockery, Dakota Fanning, Juliette Binoche, and C\u00e9line Dion among the guests today, the scene could have easily existed in a Woody Allen film, such was this contemporary vision of 1930s via 1980s femininity. The collection was rooted in Art Deco, and more specifically, the craftsmanship of red lacquer, thus offering beautifully ornamental, albeit slightly time-worn, design possibilities. And on the off chance the influence wasn\u2019t clear, there were beaded cloches\u2014lots of them. The opening look, a sculpted suit, came in a silvery geometric jacquard with forward-leaning sheen. Soon enough, reds and blues took over in vibrant accord\u2014a far bolder match than black and white. Their togetherness was relentless yet the expression was impression; each look varying the Giorgio Armani standard. As a quick recap: Jackets were abbreviated with pants and skirts contoured to the body, some flaring just slightly at the hem. The proximity to models revealed that stiff net ruffles were actually crinoline material. As an interesting twist on the theme, snakeskin and all-over sequins approximated the gloss of lacquer. Sprays of tulle studded with crystals, geometric incrustations, bows, staggered fringes, feathered volumes, velvet point d\u2019esprit, and 3-D jacquards enhanced silhouettes that spanned cocktail attire to red carpet. The collection eased into black by the end with a series of liquid-like dresses and coordinated looks. With influences that spanned Asian to Op Art, and, of course, Deco, this was an ambitious, daresay overwhelming, display in the full Armani Priv\u00e9 spirit. Cast your eye judiciously and it was full of treasures."}, {"Designer": "Azzaro", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Maxime Simo\u00ebns is in his third season as Azzaro\u2019s creative director; the French couture house was founded at the end of the \u201970s, so for the show\u2019s inspiration he went the easy route. \u201cIt was the same time of the Studio 54 beginnings in New York,\u201d he explained. \u201cI wanted to celebrate a common ground: Grace Jones, Bianca Jagger, Cher . . . party spirit and fun! Fashion has to be cheerful, non?\u201d Indeed. Studio 54\u2019s cheerfulness has been mined extensively by generations of fashion designers. Simo\u00ebns jumped onto the bandwagon, adding his French-flavored interpretation to the disco nostalgics. The end of the \u201970s/beginning of the \u201980s repertoire was rolled out in a rather by-the-book version: sleek pantsuits with bell-bottom pants drenched in sequins, airy chiffon minidresses weighed down by undulating fringes, sensual pajama ensembles with palazzo pants and square-cut blouses covered in technicolor paillettes. It was glitzy, ritzy, and sparkly, a feast of Swarovski crystals lavishly affixed to every possible surface. Silhouettes were comme il faut body-con, a touch of French panache adding a twist of sexy insouciance. Long legs were ready to shimmy, exposed by ultra-short bustier minidresses where bows sprouted playfully. Elsewhere a slender see-through number was embroidered with sequins and fringed with feathers. It looked young and spectacular, tinged with disco glamour and effortless charm."}, {"Designer": "Balmain", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Since taking over the creative direction of Balmain nearly nine years ago, Olivier Rousteing has proven that the world is his oyster. To cover what he has achieved\u2014the global brand growth, design identity, inclusive messaging, and far-reaching popularity\u2014would run the length of this review. Thus, the revival of the maison\u2019s haute couture atelier must have been his pearl; a rare and valuable manifestation of beauty, its iridescent nacre akin to layers of workmanship. And so it\u2019s not for nothing that pearls played a central part in his first couture collection. Right from the start, they appeared as giant Balmain-emblazoned orbs encircling wrists and carried in hand; they were the obvious reference for bulbous skirts molded in leather; and they were applied in bounteous quantities to lattices of ornamentation, from suits to jeans. They were the only reasonable explanation for the models\u2019 filmy white makeup. In a preview of the collection, which took place next to the busy in-house atelier, Rousteing explained that he sees his haute couture as bridging the Balmain of the past with today. \u201cOf course, the house is known for being edgy and sexy and glamorous. Here, it\u2019s all about bringing back Balmain to the elegance of la France,\u201d he said, adding that the maison\u2019s archive proved essential. \u201cEverything you see will give the sense that it\u2019s taken from the ideas of Mr. Balmain.\u201d This much is clear; the tiers upon tiers of frothy tulle, theatrically pleated fan shapes, and figure-swallowing bows looked nothing like Rousteing as we know and love him. By adding the new Balmain logo as a graffiti treatment to a superhero peplum or encrusting denim in embellishment, Rousteing said he was answering the question: What is couture in 2019? That his answer missed the mark might be owing to a few understandable considerations. The statement pieces in his ready-to-wear, as well as last year\u2019s 44 Fran\u00e7ois Premier red carpet collection, already approximated couture, leaving him with little creative oxygen. Haute couture also carries such historic, weighty precedent that growing pains will be inevitable. Finally, Rousteing has been in awe of fashion since a very young age, when he marveled over the creations of Yves Saint Laurent for Catherine Deneuve and those of Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel. Maybe these exaggerated, reimagined \u201980s volumes and ultra-pretty pastels were the fulfillment of a long-held fantasy. \u201cLet\u2019s be dreamy and inspirational,\u201d he enthused during the visit. There was, alas, nothing much dreamy about the venue\u2014the forthcoming flagship on Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9, still in a state of incompletion. This can be forgiven and soon even forgotten. The part that lingers is that, for someone who has formed such a solid connection through his #BalmainArmy, who just launched an app meant to democratize the Balmain experience, and who has ensured that you can\u2019t go four blocks in Paris without being made aware of Balmain, the collection went backward not forward. On the plus side, the line is so exclusive that it won\u2019t change the course of Balmain\u2019s history\u2014or fashion\u2019s. So for now, one can only ask, Who is the Balmain couture woman? Cue Rousteing\u2019s reply, which can be interpreted as you wish: \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting question because we don\u2019t know.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Dundas", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cShowing in L.A., showing in Hollywood, definitely did affect the collection,\u201d said Peter Dundas before putting on his seventh Dundas show at The Art of Elysium\u2019s star-studded annual Heaven fundraising gala in Los Angeles last night. \u201cI used to binge-watch Old Hollywood movies when I was a kid so that found its way in . . . there\u2019s a little bit of Tracy Lord in The Philadelphia Story and a little bit of Elvira Hancock in Scarface.\u201d Known for his unabashedly extroverted silhouettes and bold use of color, beading, animal prints, and lam\u00e9s, Dundas was almost restrained in his focus on black and metallic red carpet gowns.\u201cIt\u2019s that time of year,\u201d Dundas said simply. \u201cAnd it\u2019s long because the last collection I did was entirely short.\u201d Among the black floor-length asymmetric tuxedo and \u201940s-style pouf-shouldered dresses were occasional flashes of color in the form of Dundas\u2019s signature jewel tone caftans; metallic fil coupe dresses; and a tangerine satin jacquard jacket, pants, and bustier ensemble. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a smaller collection I was able to play with different elements and really think about individual pieces,\u201d said Dundas. For the designer\u2019s hyper-glam posse of devotees, an African-inspired giraffe-print cape and sequined bikini top, shorts, and duster were the most outr\u00e9 pieces on offer. \u201cWith having my own brand I\u2019ve become more and more sensitive with each collection to what the client needs,\u201d said Dundas of the evolution of his self-named line. \u201cI guess I can communicate more directly with my clients now. My girlfriends (he counts Poppy Delevingne, Eugenie Niarchos, Bianca Brandolini, and Emily Ratajkowski among their ranks) come and try on the clothes and tell me what they like and what they are missing in their wardrobes.\u201d And that, it appears, after a season of microminis, is length."}, {"Designer": "Elie Saab", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cI wanted to celebrate the magic of femininity,\u201d said Elie Saab backstage before the show. The usually press-shy designer was putting the final touches on the breathtaking wedding dress in crystal-encrusted tulle that would close the show, a concoction of such sumptuous lightness, it looked like a dream. \u201cOui, c\u2019est le r\u00eave!\u201d he enthused. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream of luminous mermaids emerging from the waves and promenading along the sea.\u201d The collection indeed had a liquid quality, with sinuous silhouettes dripping in silvery ocean-blue sequins. \u201cI wanted to express the brilliance and the glamour of women; I try to enhance their charm with my creations: I look at femininity with my utmost respect.\u201d Beirut is the center of Lebanese couture culture and it\u2019s where Saab keeps his ateliers, where all his collections are hand-embroidered and hand-painted. \u201cI bring to French haute couture my Mediterranean sensibility, a vision of a woman almost regal in her demeanor,\u201d he said when asked about his approach. He definitely gives the couture narrative a touch of flamboyance. In this collection, extravagance and lightness made a winning combination. Expanding on the sea life theme, ruffles rippled around figure-hugging, asymmetrically draped evening dresses in deep-blue silk cr\u00eape, and underwater gardens blossomed on delicate confections of sheer pleated tulle, organza, and iridescent taffeta. Corals were finely embroidered in tiny silver sequins on wispy ballgowns, giving them a translucent shimmer. Wearing one of these fantastic creations would transform any woman into a million-dollar mermaid. In the end, that dreamy, fantastical dimension is what true haute couture should be about."}, {"Designer": "Giambattista Valli", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Backstage at his couture show, Giamba Valli (nobody calls him by his full name, Giambattista) had only two big images hung on the walls: One was the famous Le Bain Turc by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, a painting infused with an elegant sense of erotic privacy. The other was a Helmut Newton picture taken in Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s Avenue Marceau salon in 1977 during one of his haute couture fittings, in which models dressed in his fabulously exquisite tenues de soir\u00e9e were relaxing on gilded chaises, with an attitude of sophisticated abandon. \u201cHe captured the atmosphere of the French maisons de la haute couture I was dreaming about when I decided to move to Paris to become a couturier,\u201d Valli explained. \u201cThat attitude only exists here in Paris, a sort of posture of the mind, a nervous silhouette, d\u00e9complex\u00e9e.\u201d This show seemed to celebrate Valli\u2019s own haute couture vocabulary, absorbed and distilled in the intense 14 years of his maison\u2019s life. It was a telling coincidence that Valli looked at YSL\u2019s salon picture as inspiration. Not only because he\u2019s one of haute couture\u2019s unsurpassed grand masters; but also because his spirit actually hovers over this Paris Couture Week. Two fabulous wardrobes that he designed for two exceptional women will be auctioned in the coming days: One is Catherine Deneuve\u2019s, his longtime muse and friend, and the other belongs to Mouna Ayoub, the Lebanese-born millionaire socialite of flamboyant taste. They both amassed treasure troves\u2014testaments to YSL\u2019s unerring flair for French chic, a bit of which found its way into Valli\u2019s own haute couture collection today, one of his best so far. The designer has a knack for a young silhouette. Here it found an impactful sense of balance: elongated, sophisticated, luxurious, modern. Classic haute couture tropes were given a streamlined sensuality and an attitude of confidence and sumptuous ease that had a fresh appeal. It was particularly in evidence in the collection\u2019s first part, where dresses were kept short and tight, embellishments and embroideries were lavished with a controlled hand, and volumes looked fabulous, as in a black silk faille pouf cape worn over a draped mousseline minidress. In a positive-negative effect, a black velvet shirt tunic had billowy pouf sleeves in white silk faille. It had allure in spades, also effortlessly exuded elsewhere in a series of tight cocktail dresses, densely embroidered with a night lily motif. Valli played a game of opposites throughout the collection, alternating neat, compact, contoured silhouettes with imaginative flourishes, indulging his penchant for couture pyrotechnics in a series of tiered pliss\u00e9 tulle or flounced silk taffeta robes de bal with long asymmetrical trains\u2014a bit modern Spanish Infanta, perhaps. They could\u2019ve been edited down a notch to further sharpen the message. But Valli was definitely in top form here: His haute couture lexicon needs no translation."}, {"Designer": "Iris van Herpen", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Last year, the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay mounted an exhibition on polychrome sculptures from the 19th century. There was something revelatory about these painted busts and figures since, of course, we are conditioned to seeing the purest marble or bronze. That show passed through the mind while taking in Iris van Herpen\u2019s collection today with its enigmatic explorations of color and form. The most recent collection included two or three solid hues amid her signature stony, metallic palette. But these gaseous movements of ocher and purple, these waves of vermillion, and these kinetic patterns in gradient blue felt like a turning point. And such a breathtaking disruption, in turn, invited a new reading on her work. Van Herpen is a voracious researcher who finds her message at the nexus of historical, scientific, artistic, and futuristic references. She would not have introduced color for color\u2019s sake. Backstage, she cited inspirations that spanned the Harmonia Macrocosmica (a 17th-century star atlas) to the possibility of engineered human hybrids. Cut to the 3-D-printed face-contouring jewelry, the cloud-like dresses in translucent organza (a collaboration with New York\u2013based artist and former NASA engineer Kim Keever), and the dress with \u201canamorphic faces\u201d embedded into undulating layers of white silk outlined in black. There was something Picasso-esque to the way the eyes moved as the model walked\u2014a surrealist flourish within a graceful creation. The two final looks followed a similar construction, except that the petal-like projections now appeared to be emerging from the body, not just covering it. And in warm bursts of color, the modified anatomies that remain a fascination for Van Herpen were no longer so severe. While her exoskeletons and crystalline structures have always felt far more visionary than the usual display of couture, their future as wearable designs seemed uncertain. By contrast, this collection, titled Shift Souls, expressed lightness through diaphanous silhouettes with hand-pliss\u00e9 volumes, soft patterning, and alluring body focus. This expression of femininity might translate to greater visibility for Van Herpen; and with two full days of shows to come, it set the bar high. \u201cI see it not as one shift at a time so much as an evolution,\u201d she said backstage, somewhat downplaying this significant leap. To close the show, light effects by artist Nick Verstand submerged the models in a deep blue vapor that canceled out the colors. But they definitely lingered on in the mind."}, {"Designer": "Maison Francesco Scognamiglio", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "A sense of drama is inherent to Francesco Scognamiglio\u2019s aesthetic. He\u2019s a sensualist with a penchant for theatrical, visual flourishes. Couture is congenial territory for the Pompeiian designer, the medium in which he can let loose his flamboyant classicism unrestricted. His celebrity clientele doesn\u2019t expect anything less from him. Apparently, Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, and Diane Kruger have already reserved the more Instagrammable pieces from this collection. Scognamiglio\u2019s idea of femininity is rooted in his Neapolitan upbringing; his ideal is an alluring type who likes a va-va-voom entrance. But she\u2019s also a bit elusive and mutable, like the moon, an obvious symbol chosen by the designer as this collection\u2019s inspiration. The lunar theme wasn\u2019t referenced literally, and it was actually its darker, less evanescent side that Scognamiglio referenced in this edited lineup of just 12 looks. Black sequins, flat-shaped to enhance a luminous effect, were lavished on a sparkling one-shoulder long dress with draping that cascaded asymmetrically, and a see-through number in silk tulle was embroidered with tiny glittery dots and strewn with pearls and crystals. On a more diva-esque note, a flounced dress-cape in luscious aurora borealis\u2013hued silk duchesse looked sumptuous. Silhouettes were kept fluid, reminiscent of \u201930s glamour yet injected with an \u201980s disco vibe. A pearly white mini minidress in Chantilly lace was decorated with an explosion of ruched frills sprouting from its bodice, \u201clike a surreal aerospace suit, a bit alien-looking,\u201d Scognamiglio explained. Well, perhaps NASA should consider a fashionable couture update for the astronauts\u2019 uniforms for its future missions. Scognamiglio would definitely be the designer to go to."}, {"Designer": "Ralph & Russo", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "A band of dapper mariachis greeted guests at Ralph & Russo\u2019s show today, setting the tone for the collection. \u201cI was inspired by Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix,\u201d said Tamara Ralph backstage with her partner, Michael Russo, at her side. \u201cShe was the most famous Mexican diva of all time; I love her passion, her charisma, her sensuality. She was elegant, but she didn\u2019t take fashion so seriously. We wanted to have fun this season and to celebrate her cinematic Latin-American glamour.\u201d And celebrate they did. The show was as flamboyant and extravagant as could be. Ralph and Russo had a moment of glory last year when they were in the running to dress Meghan Markle for her wedding to Prince Harry; if the Duchess of Sussex had chosen one of today\u2019s over-the-top triumphs of feathers, fringes, ruffles, and embellishments, fashion history would\u2019ve taken a rather different turn. Who knows if for better or for worse? But as the saying goes, there\u2019s no use crying over spilled milk. The Australian designers, after taking full advantage of the media exposure, are moving on with gusto. The first look was an acid green wool crepe tailored body-con pantsuit, cut very tight, a crystal and gold-embroidered snake coiling around the blazer\u2019s fitted torso, with a matching sombrero adding a playful sense of drama. The ensemble certainly made a cinematic statement. Another look seemed to pay homage to a performer of a different origin: A tiered white organza number, lavishly embroidered with glittery bananas, looked like it was made with Josephine Baker in mind. Couture collections are creative playgrounds where designers let their fantasies run free. Here, it felt like Ralph and Russo really had a blast. Feathers sprouted exuberantly from flimsy chiffon caftans, pom-poms dangled from the asymmetrical hem of a sexy black lace bustier minidress, and a bubblegum pink neoprene pantsuit was lavished with an abundance of multicolor crystal embellishments. The award for the most eccentric, imaginative combination went to a one-shoulder tunic with a cascading asymmetrical cape of sunray pleated blush pink double satin, worn over another tunic of iridescent laminated fringing. It looked made for dancing all night."}, {"Designer": "Ronald van der Kemp", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "While sitting across from C\u00e9line Dion at Ronald van der Kemp\u2019s show, the thought struck that she should be the one writing this review. We\u2019ve all seen how passionate she gets about fashion. She is also among a rarefied group of women whose positive response to Van der Kemp\u2019s sustainably sourced dresses would result in an order. Indeed, after a draped Lurex dress accented with a pleated overleaf passed by, Dion turned to her backup dancer Pepe Mu\u00f1oz and said, \u201cI\u2019m freaking out; I want everything.\u201d Dion\u2019s preferences may not speak for everyone\u2019s, but it was clear that this collection once again highlighted Van der Kemp\u2019s alchemical knack for transforming material cast-offs into singular designs imbued with the codes of couture. Where else this week could you find a floaty floral dress constructed with leftover lampshade gauze (donated, incidentally, by buzzy designer Marcel Wanders\u2019s Moooi studio)? Or a ladylike, \u201950s-inspired wedding look in which the cape originated as an embroidered bathtub covering? Or a perfectly pleated bustier in bleached denim? Or a chic, molded minidress in sheets of python that were deemed \u201csecond choice\u201d on the market? For his fourth show, Van der Kemp wisely ditched the camp performance aspect that had started to feel like a detriment when overlaid atop the dramatic \u201980s referencing that he favors in all forms. Here, he seemed to be thinking in timeless terms: the opening Grecian gown, for example. And though color-blocked tracksuit, porter uniform, and Barbie-inspired dress still conjured stylistic archetypes, several looks possessed their own inherent elegance and arty character. It\u2019s worth reminding that because Van der Kemp\u2019s creations are determined by his supply, deadstock suddenly becomes ultra-desirable\u2014see the unisex tracksuit, slick bomber, and sneakers made with stock from Amsterdam sneaker brand Filling Pieces. To him, the industry\u2019s excess is an opportunity to express his creativity."}, {"Designer": "Schiaparelli", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "As a little girl, Elsa Schiaparelli considered herself irredeemably plain (with a cluster of beauty marks on her face that poetically mapped the constellation of Ursa Major), so she had the bright idea of scattering flower seeds in her ears. \u201cTo have a face covered with flowers like a heavenly garland would indeed be a wonderful thing!\u201d she recalled in her autobiography Shocking Pink, in which, with characteristic eccentricity, she referred to herself in the third person: \u201cAnd if she could make flowers spread all over her face she would be the only woman of her kind in the whole world.\u201d Taking this idea of the magic of childhood memories, flowers, and constellations, Bertrand Guyon scattered his whimsical and eclectic collection with flowers worked in a myriad of ways. Doing so, he showcased his knowledge of the sundry crafts and techniques of the haute couture, and imbued his collection with a child\u2019s \u201csense of optimism, lightness, and freshness,\u201d reflected in a playful palette that included unexpected mixes of Pepto-Bismol-pink, lime, icy blues, lilacs, and chrome-yellow. The fragile blooms fashioned from 18th-century porcelain that were used to decorate candelabras, for instance, were replicated in a myriad tiny sequins, while those painted at the same period in astonishingly eye-popping and modern looking mixes of shocking pink and turquoise. Others were embroidered in silk thread with the na\u00efve hand of a child\u2019s drawing, or to add three-dimensionality to the luxurious warp-printed taffetas of the sort that were used to decorate Marie Antoinette\u2019s bedchamber at Versailles. The constellations appeared in various guises too, from elaborately embroidered Baroque maps of the skies to an intarsia of joyful pastel stars inset into a silk ziberline trapeze-line dress. This season, Guyon looked to Schiaparelli\u2019s postwar designs. These have been more or less eclipsed in fashion history by the memory of her avant-garde fashions in the 1930s, but still, as he discovered, yield a trove of inspirations. His new jacket shape, for instance, with rounded hips emphasizing a small waist, a softer shoulder, and stand-away pockets, was taken from documents of this period. That flattering silhouette was echoed in abbreviated little hourglass dresses, while natural hair and makeup and the surprise of star-spangled cowboy boots cut the nostalgia with a knife. Guyon has certainly made eclecticism a hallmark of this house, and never more so than this season where the looks ran the gamut from a whimsical mini globe of purple and red feathers to a stately Zurbar\u00e1n-inspired gown of marmalade and golden floral brocade; from a blossoming evening dress composed of liquid tiers of pale organza (that moved like an ocean lapping the shore), to a fitted shift embroidered in micro sequins, and finally to a gown of buoyant tiers of pink and orange tulle that was gamely worn by a nine months pregnant Erin O\u2019Connor. However, a sleek evening dress of black crepe, with a lick of white at the sleeves and a brace of diamond stars at the throat, and the unadorned black double face coat worn by the house\u2019s former directrice Farida Khelfa, with a subtle starburst of darts to shape the inner elbow, showed that Guyon doesn\u2019t always need razzle-dazzle showstoppers to showcase the art of haute couture and evoke the legendary Schiap herself."}, {"Designer": "Valentino", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about more than clothes,\u201d said Pierpaolo Piccioli backstage at his magisterial Valentino show, which effectively brought Paris\u2019s haute couture season to a close.

Designers including Raf Simons, Clare Waight Keller, Giambattista Valli, Christian Louboutin, and Valentino Garavani himself were on hand to support Piccioli, and if the preshow atmosphere was ripe with anticipation, Piccioli did not disappoint. The collection was indeed transportingly beautiful, a triumph of audacious color, flawless workmanship, and bravura statements for night leavened with glamorous and insouciant real-life propositions for day. And then there was the show casting. In the midst of fittings two days earlier, Piccioli had diversity on his mind. \u201cWhat if Cecil Beaton\u2019s [1948] photograph of those Charles James dresses could be with black women?\u201d he asked, pointing out that iconic picture of a bevy of mid-century swans on his inspiration board. Piccioli had surrounded the image with others taken from the pages of Ebony and Jet magazines from that period through the 1970s, which included such icons as Eartha Kitt and Beverly Johnson. They were joined by stately medieval depictions of black Madonnas, painterly representations of black beauty like the women in Kerry James Marshall\u2019s impactful contemporary work, and the cover girls of Franca Sozzani\u2019s July 2008 Black Issue of Italian Vogue. Piccioli\u2019s casting shamed the tokenism of even recent memory and included Sozzani\u2019s cover girls, Liya Kebede and Naomi Campbell, alongside newcomers such as Ugbad Abdi, making her runway debut, her face framed in volutes of chestnut brown horsehair crin. The diversity in the show made Piccioli\u2019s idiosyncratic colors sing even louder. \u201cYou don\u2019t invent color,\u201d said Piccioli, \u201cbut you can invent new harmonies for color.\u201d This season, those unexpected mixes included a sugared almond pink cashmere coat faced in coral, worn with a chocolate crepe blouse and emerald gabardine pants, or a lilac serape thrown over orange pants and an oyster crepe blouson fringed with floor length budellini\u2014the padded rouleau fringe beloved of Valentino himself\u2014in pale mauve. Even the solid colors were remarkable and included voluminous ball gowns in Matisse blue organza, peridot green sequins, turquoise lace, and tangerine silk faille. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in modernist couture,\u201d Piccioli protested during that preview. \u201cI love couture for what it is\u2014the lightness, the uniqueness.\u201d Nevertheless, by taking the tropes of the haute couture and of the house\u2019s particular brand of romantic femininity\u2014ruffles, ball gown volumes, lace, and old-fashioned wallpaper florals\u2014as well as the techniques and embellishments that Valentino himself perfected through the years and reworking them in dynamic ways, Piccioli created a couture that looked entirely relevant for 2019 and beyond. \u201cI don\u2019t like to show the efforts [it takes] to arrive at the magic,\u201d said Piccioli as he pointed out the astonishing details of the clothes in the Valentino atelier that are transplanted from Rome to the brand\u2019s Paris HQ in the Place Vend\u00f4me for the days leading up to the show. The famed workmanship is a justifiable source of pride for the house, and some of the more extraordinary details were printed alongside the descriptions of the looks in the run-of-show program. It is worth considering them. This season, for instance, the signature budellini that shimmied on a big-sleeved gown of silk organza scattered with cabbage roses required an additional 236 meters of the same costly custom-designed fabric, while an astonishing 63 meters of bitter yellow faille were required to make a ball gown with a butterfly-winged bow in back that was worthy of a Zurbar\u00e1n saint. Seven hundred hours of handwork, meanwhile, went into a floral-print dress with insertions of metallic lace, creating a subtle patchwork. And the narrow organza ruffles on a gown of pale organza and lace\u2014each one rolled and finished by hand with stitches so small and invisible that they can barely be detected by the human eye\u2014contributed to the 1,050 hours of work on the dress. This is what haute couture means; even the handcrafted hosiery was fashioned from collages of couture lace. Many of the models\u2019 eyes were framed in petals to transform them into flower fairies out of the 19th-century French artist J. J. Grandville or the 1960s makeup genius Pablo Manzoni, and the 65 looks were each named for flowers. By the time Campbell sashayed through the salons of the palatial late-19th-century townhouse built for Salomon Mayer von Rothschild wearing Chocolate Dahlia of deepest brown translucent organza, hemmed with deep tiers of taffeta ruffles, the crowd was on its feet cheering this celebration of grace and beauty."}, {"Designer": "Viktor & Rolf", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren titled this collection Fashion Statements. \u201cTo what extent can you say something with clothing, literally,\u201d they said backstage. Their studio had imagined 18 outstanding, outsize dresses constructed entirely in brightly hued tulle: some with puffed sleeves, others with tiered skirts, all very colorful and very voluminous. And, well, each creation spoke for itself. Who were these ingenues with their Rapunzel hair meant to embody? I am my own muse, said the one in solid green. Is fashion overrated? Less is more, replied the extra-wide one in gradient pink and blue. What is your position on climate change? Give a damn, declared the one in white trimmed in white and fluorescent green. Will you watch the Super Bowl? No, exclaimed the one in striped blue. Naturally, with their characteristic monotone, the designers said they were not imposing any meaning, inviting us to arrive at our own readings. One impression was that such exaggerated volumes, while familiar territory for Horsting and Snoeren, could be a visual metaphor for the noise of likes in the virtual world, where these language memes live (Snoeren seemed pleased with this idea). What\u2019s more, there was no mistaking these creations for actual slogan T-shirts or variations on the infamous Melania Trump jacket. All the assorted typography and graphic design\u2014the text as well as the eagle head, the skull, the candy hearts, and so forth\u2014resulted from layers of additional tulle. Trite sentiments backed up by technical prowess. Altogether, the collection showcased Viktor & Rolf in the brand\u2019s finest, sweet-meets-sinister form. As a fashion statement, it was ironic in attitude; historically inspired and Pop in presentation; detail obsessed and sophisticated in execution. The perfect formula, in other words, for the Costume Institute\u2019s forthcoming exhibition on camp. Otherwise, several pieces could prove quite impactful on the red carpet, unwieldy shapes notwithstanding. The obvious choice: No photos, please."}, {"Designer": "Zuhair Murad", "Season": "Spring Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "The underwater life of mermaids and sea creatures seemed to fascinate quite a few couture designers this week; actually, it\u2019s the easiest, first-degree inspiration for any summer collection. This being couture, the oceans were obviously imagined like fantastical dreamlands\u2014certainly not like the plastic-infested, pollution-endangered future wastelands they actually are. The sustainability conversation has a long way to go before landing on these shores. Sea life was thus referenced in Zuhair Murad\u2019s dramatic collection, where opulence blended with a modern flair on \u201980s-inspired silhouettes. The designer kept the theme rather controlled, without any too-literal translations, save for a multilayered nude tulle ball gown encrusted with embroidered corals. Still, its exquisitely executed embellishments had a lovely lightness. Wispy ruffled confections were offered in quite a few shades of blue d\u00e9grad\u00e9: \u201dThey evoke the feel of ripples on water,\u201d said Murad. Yet beyond an apparent predilection for allover, look-at-me sparkle (\u201cMy women want to be seen,\u201d he said), he favors a young, contemporary feel. Here, he was at his best when working on sleek, streamlined shapes, sensual more than overtly sexy, as in a series of long figure-hugging, sequined silk tulle numbers, with slit sides and billowy, sheer chiffon trains. The train was sort of the collection\u2019s leitmotif; in a deep blue shade of layered silk chiffon, it was tied on the back of a tailored miniskirt suit, lavishly embroidered. Worn with a matching brassiere, it exuded a modern appeal. The color palette was charming, progressing backward from blue-black tones inspired by the ocean\u2019s depth, through all the conceivable shades of turquoise, aqua, shell pink, and coral, reaching the luminous quality of mother-of-pearl, abalone-gray, and silver at the finale."}, {"Designer": "Alberta Ferretti Limited Edition", "Season": "Fall Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Alberta Ferretti went for sculptural shapes in her Limited Edition collection, a far cry from the wispy concoctions she\u2019s known for. In recent seasons, she has tried to break away from her familiar aesthetic of ethereal femininity, experimenting with a more substantial and modern take on design, expanding the daywear offering, and addressing a younger audience. Here she continued her exploration on new style templates, working on more structured, 3-D volumes while keeping silhouettes fluid and simple. \u201cI like simplicity but not simplification,\u201d she said. What stood out in the collection was the color palette, unusually audacious for Ferretti, who favors paler and dustier hues. Instead she went bold, with bright shades of chartruese, fire red, turquoise, and fuchsia enhanced by the luscious textures of radzimirs and liquid silk satins. It gave impact to a voluminous, dramatic winged cape worn over slim-fitting pants, or to a red carpet\u2013worthy, floor-sweeping number with a feminine bow-front bustier. The play of elongated, simple contours was continued in tiered chiffon dresses and evening jumpsuits with lace-embroidered intarsia and fan-pleated ruches. Sequined minidresses had a svelte allure. Yet Ferretti\u2019s flair for romance cannot be easily dismissed. \u201cWe need to dream,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need a bit of magic and eccentricity.\u201d No arguing with that.

While that\u2019s not exactly headline-making news, it is interesting that designers are finding a receptive audience for made-to-measure tailoring. That was Alexandre Vauthier\u2019s message today. \u201cCouture,\u201d he said, is \u201caussi pour le jour.\u201d Vauthier is an accomplished technician, and he pointed out that much of the work in this collection was done by hand. Women in the market for a sharp le smoking could do worse than the one he showed at the top of his show with a ruffle-front white shirt, bow tie, and pink carnation pinned to its exaggerated lapel. His other jackets had a more oversize proportion, cut boxy and with big shoulders in an \u201980s vein, which accentuated the attenuated silhouette of his midi skirts and super-brief running-style shorts. As for flou, Vauthier avoided the grandiose gowns typical of many couture designers. For every strapless pouf, there were slinky draped jersey dresses studded with grids of Swarovski crystals. In the past, that kind of sexy fare was standard issue chez Vauthier, but he prefers a sweeter, more romantic look for the most part now. His palette was black, white, and baby pink, pulled from a hand-painted print of flowers that he used on a pair of dresses: the first a shirtdress with a lampshade skirt and the second a strapless number with a train. The after-dark stars were the shapely yet understated LBDs cinched at the waist with silk ribbons and blooms."}, {"Designer": "Alexis Mabille", "Season": "Fall Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Alexis Mabille opted out of a runway show this season, presenting his couture collection in the gilded salons of the Fondation Dosne-Thiers. \u201cI wanted to get back to the very essence of couture, which is about a personal relationship between the designer and the client,\u201d he explained. Indeed. Unlike ready-to-wear, buying a couture dress is a truly unique experience, tailor-made according not only to the customer\u2019s body type but also her special requirements. More often than not, the client in question has stellar spending power and a lifestyle to match, which makes exclusivity (and dedication to her whims and wishes) almost a prerequisite. Tellingly, this collection was called T\u00eate-\u00e0-T\u00eate. The dresses, exposed on mannequins, were almost like a series of diverse characters: the Frivolous, the Playful, the Wild, the Thoughtful. There was something for every Mabille-loving woman, a variety of shapes and silhouettes encompassing a vast spectrum of body types (and a smaller spectrum of bank accounts). Elongated, sleek, mermaid-like bustier sheaths, lavishly embroidered with pearls and silver threads, alternated with theatrical, roomy, ample ruffled capes in dramatic black faille. Sexy corseted bodysuits and see-through black lace catsuits that could make a Playboy Bunny blush contrasted with demure, Parisian-bourgeois ensembles of silk pleated skirts paired with white lace high-collar blouses. What could possibly look good on a romantic femme bonbon? Obviously, an ethereal cloud of dusty pink tulle whipped up merengue-like into tiered concoctions. And what about an intellectual prima donna who has a penchant for architectural shapes and isn\u2019t afraid of grand gestures? Voil\u00e0! A long wrap dress, not too revealing, but magnificent in its white splendor, with a wide collar for added drama. But beyond the very of-the-moment, diverse offering, the thing all the looks had in common was not only the exquisite, sumptuous execution required from an experienced couturier but also the panache and youthful esprit the witty Mabille infused the collection with: No matter the body type, a joyful sense of glamour always feels uplifting."}, {"Designer": "Armani Priv\u00e9", "Season": "Fall Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Giorgio Armani held two haute couture shows at the Petit Palais today. This writer attended the first and the celebrities attended the second. The week has been light on A-listers, the omnipresent C\u00e9line Dion notwithstanding, so how disappointing to learn that Nicole Kidman, her IRL husband, her Big Little Lies husband, and Zendaya, to boot, were front row at show two. Armani has been movie crazy since his youth, and his Priv\u00e9 collection has long been designed with an eye to the red carpet. It\u2019s engaging to watch it march past, wondering who might choose the austere black zip-front coatdress embroidered with crystals, and who would prefer a tiered tulle confection in icy shades of pink, mint, and baby blue. The extensive collection was more or less evenly divided into two sections: black looks opened and closed the show, and in between Armani inserted an array of sweet pastels. In both sections the tailoring template followed this general rule: Structured but imaginatively tailored jackets topped trousers with a pajama-like ease; in most cases the pants were veiled with a net, which increased the sense of flou or movement, especially when that net was dusted with sparkle. On one striking ensemble, the jacket\u2019s grid of bead clusters was echoed by the polka-dot print of the veiled pants. (The veiling concept worked less successfully on tops.) Turning back to the red carpet, there were two likely contenders that showcase the range of the Priv\u00e9 evening offering. The first was a strapless powder pink silk satin dress embroidered with pearls and crystals in a lozenge motif swathed in lam\u00e9 tulle. It dipped alluringly low in back but retained a regal aura. The second was a black tulle full-skirted gown with a matching cape. Both gown and cape were ebullient with lam\u00e9 polka dots."}, {"Designer": "Azzaro", "Season": "Fall Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Now minus a creative director\u2014although one is expected to be named imminently\u2014Azzaro finds itself in limbo once again. It\u2019s in good company: A number of other once-illustrious houses are now desperately seeking a 21st-century identity. But that\u2019s not a club anyone ever deliberately chooses to join. Given this unenviable set of circumstances, you gotta hand it to the studio. It pulled together a coherent show, and a team of six took a bow together\u2014three women and three men. Among them were three who knew and worked with Loris Azzaro. The living memory remains in-house. True to form, the team was in a party mood: \u201cFestive bohemian\u201d was how one spokesperson put it, while the show notes evoked a woman fluent in \u201cthe subtle art of unveiling\u201d and \u201cboldly\u2026revealing spark\u201d without a hint of irony. Indeed, there was a lot of near \u201cbare\u201d here, from a handful of tributes to Mr. Azzaro\u2019s defining, 1970s-era three-ring dress to a silver crystal cage dress worn with a whisper of a black cape. On-trend embellishments included d\u00e9grad\u00e9 in tie-dyed fabric, beading treatments, and shimmering fringe, as well as a certain notion of gender fluidity in elaborately studded men\u2019s jackets and iridescent trenches, for example. This particular dance floor is already jam-packed, so one wonders how the house will be able to rise above the commotion. Even so, in-house sources say that revenues have doubled since last year; they also say that they\u2019re fielding requests from A-list stars in Hollywood\u2014Vogue Runway promised not to jinx it by naming names, but if any one of those women actually shows up on the red carpet in Azzaro, that could prove a game changer. And if, as rumored, a beauty heavyweight steps in to burnish a label with fragrance franchises named Wanted and Chrome, there may be synergies and a new life yet on the fashion side. Those are some big ifs.

The models moved at a more leisurely pace than usual through this contemplative environment to a soundtrack created by music maestro Michel Gaubert that included Portishead\u2019s \u201cGlory Box\u201d with its lyric \u201cI just want to be a woman.\u201d Although Gaubert insisted the music had been chosen for the \u201cmore casual\u201d feel of the presentation after Lagerfeld\u2019s fast-moving, high-octane pyrotechnics\u2014and the introspection of the library environment\u2014it seemed an apt complement to this woman-friendly collection. Self-effacing as ever, Viard didn\u2019t appear to take her bow after the show; instead she was backstage being congratulated by her teary-eyed premiers d\u2019ateliers and the great fournisseurs of Paris\u2014the embroiderers, feather artists, button and ribbon makers, et al.\u2014who have collaborated with her for the three decades that she worked alongside Lagerfeld as his studio coordinator at Chlo\u00e9 and subsequently Chanel. The savoir faire that Viard developed over that time with these wizards of technique and craft was on display in this quiet collection, which revisited the Chanel tropes developed by both Mademoiselle herself and subsequently by Lagerfeld, including skinny coatdresses to the ankle that flashed luxe silk satin linings as the models moved; full-skirt velvet gowns cut to romantic ballet length or grazing the floor about flat shoes; and tiered chiffon Jazz Age dresses with stitched pleats released into fluttering fullness. In place of Lagerfeld\u2019s hard geometry, Viard added her softer touch in the rounded volumes of a magenta bomber jacket worn over a minidress with a cool Parisienne, retro-\u201980s vibe; in the surprise of tweed dungarees; and in shapely jackets (some with gentle leg-of-mutton sleeves) with face-flattering ivory satin collars or organza ruffs, worn over wide oxford bags of the type Chanel herself carried in the 1930s. Viard\u2019s skill in harnessing the genius of the flou and tailoring ateliers and suppliers was revealed in touches such as a diaphanous T-shirt embellished with white plumes bearing written poems; a bolero jacket formed from clustered feather \u201croses\u201d; textiles that looked like tweed but on closer inspection proved to be solid embroideries; and the liquid flow of acres of pale mauve chiffon made into a strapless evening dress that rippled like the waters of a stream in movement. It was a collection that almost felt anti-fashion but was instead an ode to flattering elegance that should keep the pampered Chanel couture clients happy."}, {"Designer": "Elie Saab", "Season": "Fall Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "As guests were taking their seats, ambient music gave some indication that Elie Saab had looked to China, or Asia more broadly, for inspiration. This was confirmed from the first look, with gowns moving through harmonies of construction and craftsmanship that conjured empresses and women of high rank displaying their beauty and influence. Richly jewel-toned in velvet and satin, or else ethereally light in satin or tulle, the silhouettes were all manner of ceremonial, romantic, and regal. There were floor-sweeping trains and thigh-high slits; peaked shoulders and one-shoulders; kimono sleeves and cape sleeves; enveloping robes and stricter columns. The embroideries were exceedingly lavish, suggesting auspicious flora and fauna but more abstract than figurative, as though rendered in movement, as well as tracery patterns that would be found on royal garments. There were also a number of dresses whose surfaces displayed not a single sequin or bead; most certainly, these will be well received for existing outside the theme. In the collection notes, Saab is quoted as saying, \u201cI was drawn to East Asia\u2019s rich culture, and the more I let my mind dive into it, the more I explored imperial volumes within the collection, using signature touches that remain true to the Maison.\u201d Waist emphasis qualifies as one of those signature touches: This season, more often than not, the dresses were enhanced with belts comprised of contoured golden discs. Meanwhile, the soundtrack largely toggled between Thom Yorke and Ryuichi Sakamoto, underscoring the contemporary East-West trope that, for whatever reason, proves endlessly alluring in fashion and beyond. Apart from hair and makeup that played up a more caricatured look, this sumptuously executed collection treated the traditional elements with artistic respect. But it\u2019s interesting to consider that on the same day that Christine Lagarde was named the first woman to lead the European Central Bank, these dresses seem to elevate women within a fantasized realm."}, {"Designer": "Fendi", "Season": "Fall Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cWe dominate the city from here!\u201d declared Silvia Venturini Fendi exultantly before her show, surveying Rome\u2019s Colosseum from the Palatine Hill. \u201cThe city was founded on this hill,\u201d Fendi added. \u201cThe first stone of Rome was laid here by Romulus.\u201d Karl Lagerfeld had been enthusiastic about the prospect of a show set against this magnificent backdrop, and of the Fendi company\u2019s underwriting of the restoration of the Temple of Venus and Roma, built by the emperor Hadrian in 121 (where the post-collection dinner for 600 would be held alfresco under the moonlight). Venturini Fendi explained that her collection was an homage to the late designer, who revolutionized fur with his innovative designs and transformed the company\u2014founded by her grandparents Adele and Eduardo Fendi in 1925\u2014into a design force and a global luxury powerhouse in the 54 years that he designed for it. For Venturini Fendi, Lagerfeld\u2019s legacy includes not only the skills and techniques that he inspired those workrooms to develop, but \u201chis attitude to break rules and push boundaries.\u201d For him, she added, \u201cnothing was ever impossible, and that\u2019s what we all tried for.\u201d The supremely elegant collection celebrated the astonishing feats that the Fendi workrooms are capable of. The clothes took their cue from the floors of Rome\u2014of the ancient mosaics, timeworn terra-cotta or stone, and the marble that once clad the Colosseum itself, and then of the plants growing up through those monuments and the sturdy roots linking them to the strata of the city\u2019s history. This was a tour de force of complex intarsia work that looked from afar like geometric prints. The opening looks set the tone, evoking Lagerfeld\u2019s early-\u201970s glory years when he first made himself felt as a design force at Chlo\u00e9 and Fendi\u2014from the ABBA-tastic pudding bowl wig to the rock crystal heels. The show opened with a shapely white felted-wool suit with a full-sleeve jacket and wide boot-leg pants. In this period mood there were maxi coats with fur strips worked in different directions or sheared to create Deco patterns in other Lagerfeld signature inventions. Every coat was reversible, and one example\u2014a swaggering, ankle-grazing duster of faille lined in darkest sable (and worn with a chunky medallion and attitude)\u2014paid homage to the Fendi costuming of Silvana Mangano for Luchino Visconti\u2019s iconic 1974 movie Conversation Piece. Mindful of global warming, and on a sultry Roman day that saw the thermometer bubble to 95 degrees, Venturini Fendi had also noted that even furs need to be \u201clighter and lighter.\u201d This meant \u201cbricks\u201d of finely sheared fur or fabric pieces with sheer tulle as the \u201cgrout.\u201d For this Fall collection there were even sheer black ball gowns, worn over marble-print sports bras. The evening gowns\u2014shown under the slither of a picture-perfect crescent moon\u2014bloomed with a Renaissance beauty: flowing Juliet dresses in rose or celadon quartz\u2013colored chiffon embroidered with sheaves of wheat or trembling tendrils like the powdery stamens of lilies, and magnificent gowns that might have excited a Titian or Bronzino. Like the haunting live soundtrack by Caterina Barbieri, the virtuosic composer, the clothes evoked a mystic past but remained firmly rooted in the present and the future, proving that the ever-inventive, questing Venturini Fendi and her team are able standard-bearers of the Lagerfeld legacy."}, {"Designer": "Giambattista Valli", "Season": "Fall Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Giambattista Valli is having a busy year.

Come November, he\u2019ll launch the rest of the project with another event the location and scope of which is still TBD. And over the weekend he dressed Charlotte Casiraghi, a granddaughter of Grace Kelly, in a one-of-a-kind dress for her and Dimitri Rassam\u2019s second nuptials. It\u2019s not surprising that Valli\u2019s instinct for haute couture week was to create a \u201cmoment of peace.\u201d His idea was to stage an exhibition rather than a show, but it\u2019s not necessarily the easy way out that it sounds. \u201cEverything has to be perfect,\u201d he said of the installation. \u201cYou can\u2019t get away with what you can get away with at a show.\u201d Valli approached the exhibition as a reexamination of his successes. The presentation opened with a group of mannequins dressed in monogrammed white button-downs and big tulle skirts. Two large rooms followed, one dedicated to what he described as the art of the atelier\u2014i.e., a bustier dress embellished neckline to hem in three-dimensional silk taffeta peony blooms and a micro-minidress of wool crepe and silk with tiny embroideries of orange blossoms and dahlia petals. The second room was filled with his \u201cobsessions,\u201d which more of less boil down to rose prints, ruffles, exuberant volumes, and, bien s\u00fbr, high-low numbers of the sort Jenner rocked in Cannes.

There\u2019s computer programming and physics and alchemy behind each one; they\u2019re complicated to make and just as difficult to explain. Better is to think of her work as art pieces, with each dress a canvas and the model who wears it the frame on which it\u2019s stretched. This season van Herpen collaborated with American kinetic sculptor Anthony Howe, whose pieces are powered by the wind. His spherical Omniverse sculpture had pride of place in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Montmartre venue. The designer said she was compelled by the way its arching vertebrae, spinning on a curving axis, simultaneously expand and contract. Her finale dress was made in the image of Omniverse, with rotating wings constructed of aluminum, stainless steel, and feathers. For the show, Van Herpen explained, the spinning was mechanized, but outside in the wind the wings would twist just like Howe\u2019s kinetic sculptures. It was spectacular but in a performative way. What\u2019s so interesting about this collection is the way that even the pieces without Howe\u2019s input were kinetic. They positively vibrated. Van Herpen achieved this in part by utilizing the Japanese ink-on-water technique of suminagashi; it created a print of lines, which she heat bonded to Mylar and laser cut in contrapositive ways. See what we mean about complicated? There were many other compelling treatments besides, including the same \u201cglitch\u201d laser cutting that yielded Broadway mogul Jordan Roth\u2019s arresting Met Gala look, only here she did it on silk duchesse painted with erotic flowers. Picking up on Howe\u2019s work, Van Herpen\u2019s theme for the season was nature and the interconnectedness of its systems. A pair of other glitch dresses looked animal spotted.

Of late, Galliano has toggled between unbridled excess and sober, even austere-by-his standards, structure. He is one of precious few designers working today who can do both absolutely convincingly. Inspired, he went on to explain, by his perception of \u201cdecay and the breakdown of social structure,\u201d he came down on the side of sensory overload and decadence for this coed Fall couture show. That sounds not unlike what he was up to in January, when he presented his Spring couture. But though the instinct may be the same, Galliano\u2019s thought process and methodology here were new. Two major dynamics were at work. The first he described as \u201cprojective filtrage.\u201d Inspired by the sense that we are \u201ceternally walking through a projection\u201d\u2014which has to be the most poetic description of Instagram ever uttered\u2014he created his own projections, printing images of tweeds and houndstooths, as well as animal skins and erotic photos, onto translucent technical fabrics which overlaid his Teddy Boy tailoring. Veiling has been a theme of the week, used variously for seduction or protection. Galliano\u2019s take on it is the most conceptual. In a sense, the vibrating translucent materials act as personalized filters, elevating and optimizing the garments and their wearers. Who needs Facetune? The other angle Galliano worked was more familiar to his followers. He calls it \u201cnomadic cutting,\u201d and it\u2019s the idea of taking familiar pieces, turning them upside down and inside out, supersizing them, and transforming them into novel garments, so that, say, a pair of pants becomes a bustier dress. More so than in seasons past, Galliano used traditional couture gestures to create his shapes\u2014not just bustiers, but also Watteau backs and prodigious trains. These virtuosic pieces were a reminder of the heights Galliano has achieved, but they produced a new frisson. He sees them as utterly genderless now. Fashion eyes may have adjusted to boys playing the coquette in thigh-high boots and garters, but it\u2019s still a fairly radical look in much of the real world. Instagram and our various other social media streams are sold to us as celebrations of the self, but there\u2019s a dulling and anesthetizing that\u2019s happening.

What followed was a transition into color starting with Impressionist pastel hues and soft surface detail, then gowns that turned more dazzling and, at times, rather glitzy.

Their clients, meanwhile, keep getting younger and younger\u2014as in, 18-to-25-year-olds. For them, the relevance of couture is that it can be both exclusive and everyday. Ralph said when these girls find a look they like, they might have it modified into a skirt and a top. This would explain why the tweed peplum jackets and miniskirts worn with flats had a more ingenue spirit than many of the diaphanous gowns. In any case, what the designers understand so well is the fantasy made real\u2014and to their credit, they do this with an intense level of craftsmanship and without repetition. \u201cPeople still want that\u2014and they always will,\u201d said Ralph.

Instead, Rucci focused on lean jersey dresses fashioned for a particularly chic mother superior, and a focus on elegant daywear that reflects the feedback from the designer\u2019s discriminating clientele. Rucci has been quietly making bespoke pieces for his devoted clients for several years now, and his self-financed RR331 collection\u2014made in collaboration with Nicolas Caito\u2019s New York atelier, which evidently holds its own with the best of the Paris couture workrooms\u2014whispers in a noisy world. But in an haute couture season that saw a gentle pragmatism at Chanel, courtesy of Virginie Viard, and a monochromatic rigor at Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s Dior, Rucci\u2019s collection seems more timely than ever. As he expresses it, he makes \u201cfashion where a woman emerges and not the clothes.\u201d Although he does not shy from the grand gesture, Rucci\u2019s monastic clothes for RR331 rely not on runway theatrics, but on the superb workmanship that has always characterized the output of this master craftsman who knows his devoted clients as well as his way around a sweep of duchess satin, silk gazar, or double-face wool. \u201cIn my first collection in 1981, I experimented with draping on the bias in paper taffeta and jersey,\u201d Rucci explained. He recently returned to the technique for the first time since then when he dressed the Mothers and Fathers of the legendary Voguing Houses for the Fabulous Independent Educated Radicals for Community Empowerment (FIERCE) benefit event L\u2019Hommage\u2026A Night of Celebration, Unity, and Love at Judson Memorial Church last May. \u201cIt just felt so right again,\u201d Rucci said.

Gr\u00e8s in those savant draperies of Taroni paper silk taffeta and jersey; Balenciaga in the funnel-collar tunics and balmacaans and the sophisticated construction that allows Rucci to create voluminous shapes using the inherent qualities of the materials; and James in the curving seams that writhe round the body, and that Rucci modernizes with sly translucent insets that flash slithers of skin beneath and affirm the designer\u2019s place in this pantheon of perfectionists."}, {"Designer": "Schiaparelli", "Season": "Fall Couture", "Year": "2019", "Text": "This was the scene of Daniel Roseberry\u2019s debut outing as the creative director of Schiaparelli: in the center of the blacked-out room, an artist\u2019s drafting table with a thicket of half-smoked cigarettes wafting smoky incense, and on it the most frightening and exciting thing an artist and designer can be faced with\u2014a blank page. Soundtrack? The rackety sound of the Manhattan subway train as it emerges into the sunlight to cross the bridge to Brooklyn. In a sign of his fearlessness, the preternaturally calm Roseberry himself emerged to take his seat at his drafting table. Just as he did last winter when he was working on his Schiaparelli presentation, he put on his headset to block out the sound of that train (as heard from his own Chinatown apartment) and the room broke into the eclectic sounds on his playlist (Buffy Sainte-Marie\u2019s Up Where We Belong, Chic\u2019s Good Times, Aretha Franklin\u2019s Freeway of Love), as he began sketching the clothes in his elegant, sweeping hand, and they started to materialize before the audience\u2014\u201cgetting off the page and getting 3D,\u201d as he expressed it, \u201cwith volume and freedom and this celebration of the body.\u201d In one carefully orchestrated gesture, Roseberry was showing the world what this relatively unknown designer\u2014a behind-the-scenes force at Thom Browne for a decade or so\u2014looks like, as well as what he can do with the courage of his convictions (which include marking the 1930s Schiaparelli \u201csignature\u201d label with his thumbprint in just the same way that Schiap\u2019s contemporary, Madeleine Vionnet, guaranteed her own original clothes). During a preview on the eve of the show, Roseberry laid out his philosophy for the brand. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be nostalgic,\u201d he said while showing a mood board with eclectic references that ran the gamut from Jack Whitten\u2019s \u201cabstract cosmologies\u201d and Sarah Lucas\u2019s disquieting stuffed stocking sculpture to jagged Art Deco bracelets and model-artist Veruschka von Lehndorff\u2019s body-paint \u201cclothing.\u201d Instead, Roseberry looked at the Surrealist idea of displacement\u2014a Stephen Jones \u201cbrain\u201d hat, a bustier top set in at peplum height\u2014and what for him has emerged as \u201cthe most interesting part of the Schiap universe: animalia, that obsession with nature.\u201d This meant Schiap surrealisms such as scarlet acrylic false nails transformed into ladybugs (some of them encrusting the bustier top, worn with a ballgown\u2019s billowing skirts); a giant rhinestone python coiled around the neck; and exotic skins used to face handsome tailoring (a pragmatic response to the Schiaparelli couture sales team relaying their client\u2019s requests for daywear). Roseberry disdained reedits of the celebrated Lesage embroideries, but was inspired instead by a trompe l\u2019oeil belt like a folded ribbon that now snaked around jacket revers as well as defining waistlines. He used those acrylic nails (including kitschy island-sunset variants) as both embroidery and jewelry elements\u2014and crafted a sheath dress in Velcro with beaded elements that could in principle be moved around at will (for the less adventurous, the same silhouette is available in velvet). The man-woman dynamic that is a potent legacy of Roseberry\u2019s Thom Browne years was given exuberant expression in a \u201ccatch and release\u201d tailored jacket with sleeves that billowed into wings of faille that had been overdyed and beaten to knock the formality out of the fabric, paying homage to Schiap\u2019s use of rough-textured materials.

Backstage before his show, the designer recounted a recent invitation to a gala in Marrakech that allowed him to discover Morocco for the first time. What he saw blew him away. \u201cMarrakech is paradise; I fell in love,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch a cosmopolitan city. There\u2019s so much heritage and tradition there, but it also has a modern vibe. It\u2019s like Beirut but with a different style.\u201d Back in his Beirut atelier, he decided to make it his own. Drawing, magpie-like, from his own lexicon along with a dash of Yves Saint Laurent in Marrakech in the \u201970s, he transposed the colors and artisanal motifs he had admired on tile work and carpets, and borrowed from the traditional tattoos worn by desert tribes, conflating those with Indian influences and recasting them all through meter upon meter of bejeweled, sequined silk chiffon and taffeta. The first look, a tulle minidress with a plunging neckline, was embroidered all over with decorative motifs. It neatly encapsulated a collection of embroideries so intricate you can see why the designer needs two fully staffed ateliers (one in Beirut, the other in Paris) to complete them. The embroidered leopard-print jacket was just one case in point. For a gown with a black velvet bodice, the tile motif was transposed literally into a jacquard Murad developed specifically for lightness, in desert colors like brick, amber, and amaranth with sunset-gold Lurex. It was lavish and also relatively restrained in this context. Elsewhere, a patchwork of different tile designs appeared on a fully embroidered jet-black ball gown. Sequined florals cascaded over gowns, some with feather-trimmed capes, and tattoo motifs spilled over tuxedo stripes on a rare pantsuit. The show, like the runway, could have been shorter, but Murad\u2019s ladies thrilled to it all, posting looks frenetically from the front row. By Murad\u2019s own reckoning, he fulfills as many as 10 couture bridal commissions a month on average. True love aside, these brides marry for The Dress, and to close, he offered them something to dream about, an ivory gown with an abstract floral-carpet pattern in tonal crystals and sequins that, in his own words, was designed with a real-life princess in mind."}, {"Designer": "A-Cold-Wall", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Samuel Ross is the only designer in London who has 15- and 16-year-old boys skipping school to congregate outside his show in hopes of getting in.

Freedom of movement, nationalistic fears; these are nuances I\u2019m touching on in this show.\u201d There was a regular runway in the narrow space between the two tanks, in which two groups of black performance artists clung together, helping each other to crawl through the water. In a week when a Royal Navy patrol has been sent out to intercept boatloads of migrants desperately crossing the English Channel to seek asylum from the camps of France, it made for conceptual imagery that came uncomfortably close to home.

You don\u2019t see the surrounding drama in the water in these pictures\u2014or the moment when a Rottweiler was let out to bark at the actors. The brief Ross seemed to have set himself is that his vision of streetwear isn\u2019t going to be confined to any sub-cult lane. His collection spoke to the graphic design education the 27-year-old received at De Montfort University, filtering the symbols of graph paper, rulers, and protractors into his brand identity, with the slogan \u201cModernist\u201d printed on coat hems and scarves. It reached for a sophisticated level of design, integrating the familiar language of utility pockets, zippers, and puffers into a collection that now extends to tailored suits in technical fabrics, trenchcoats, and leather jackets with cut-out portholes. Like so many of his young British menswear peers this season, Ross went one confident stride beyond what might have been expected of those representing a country mired in adversity.

Abdul Abasi and Greg Rosborough\u2019s Fall 2019 collection offers a glimpse at what happens when designers modify their perspective. Though their six-year-old label has always utilized deadstock fabric and natural materials, this season they took the concept a step further, offering buyers a greatest-hits selection of silhouettes available in combinations exclusive to each store. The goal of the customization: pieces with greater individuality and less resulting waste. By targeting their menswear staples to the needs of each market and creating only what is needed, Abasi and Rosborough cut down on overhead while getting a blow by blow on what their consumers actually want. Wool coats and thick sweaters may satisfy designer whims, but clients in temperate locales don\u2019t need them; likewise smaller orders with one-of-a-kind pieces edge closer to the limited-edition-drops model adopted by countless labels. In a moment when exclusivity is prioritized, the move toward fewer items is a smart one, but let\u2019s be honest: Without great clothes, it\u2019s all moot. Thankfully, Abasi and Rosborough\u2019s output is compelling all on its own. Fall found the duo playing with ideas about functionality, offering up reversible outerwear in contrasting shades of crimson and black, luxe leopard-printed bomber jackets, and an array of textured separates shot alongside reams of material in the corresponding lookbook.

Here, he worked to mash together many disparate elements into a newly coalesced menswear proposition. Farming has been a pretty rare reference at the shows, but it was present today in tractor-soled, half-length rubber work boots reimagined in leather; a flecked pale work jacket with a strapped satin utility pouch; and cow-print trenchcoats.

There was stretch suiting in textured jersey, some nice long coats in soft velvet in hard colors (the pale, pale pistachio looked especially strong), fitted pants and tightly darted shorts in top-to-toe finely lined brown with lavender topstitching, and super-oversize work shirting. Pants featured vibrantly lined pockets that could be worn open on the hip, as they were in this show, but were also built to function when fastened at one side by hook and eye to the waistband.

For this collection Macclesfield-raised Sarah Burton (this makes her a northerner) transported the McQueen aesthetic away from soft, southern London and up toward the rugged heartlands of her upbringing. As in the most recent womenswear collection, there was a heavy leaning on the sartorial that showcased the virtuosity of the Yorkshire textile mills with which McQueen partnered. The fiercest suits featured tooth both hound and puppy, blended and mashed into competing sections of check and pattern. When worn under oversize overcoats in more blown-up houndstooth, these looks were as intense on the eye as a Bridget Riley canvas. More suits came in bold, cock-of-the-walk checks with startling stripes of blue and pink: Mighty fine Fancy Dan fare when teamed with strong-collared silk shirting in check-complementing colors. The glinting crystal necklaces and earrings and crystal-stringed jackets were presented as homages to the glamour of Blackpool\u2019s ballrooms, and pink, burgundy, or blue silk jacquard suits featured metallic rose emblems, symbols so significant to the history of north/south relations that a war was named after them. A beautifully finished gabardine trench came lined in a torn-collage rose print that featured throughout the collection, either as print or embroidery. Burton also mined earthier attire than suiting. On a foundation of exaggerated-soled monkey boots she recast the donkey jacket in brushed wool and shrunk the parka to much punkier proportions than usual. There were boilersuits in dahlia pink silk and black leather; strapped officer great coats, vaguely sinister, in black leather; and a funnily hardcore-mumsy mix of housecoats in painted check over leathers: when Coronation Street met Carnaby Street. If you looked hard at those leather great coats you could make out the faintest patterned relief: On jacquard suits, trousers, and jackets was a pretty enlarged Sheffield lace pattern whose boldness here functioned as the antithesis of the net curtains that inspired it.

There are a lot of cottons, a lot of wools.\u201d Ahn\u2019s profile has risen dramatically since last summer, due largely to her appointment as Kim Jones\u2019s jewelry chief at Dior Homme (Ambush began as a jewelry line). In the months since, Ahn has collaborated\u2014and will continue to collaborate\u2014with Nike and expanded Ambush\u2019s offerings. This collection is her biggest yet, and it includes another partnership, this time with Converse on brilliant (and sure to be copped) rubberized boots. They feature a raised sole, layered seams, and utilitarian markings like Keep double laced to hold firmly. They\u2019re one of the strongest shoe styles of the season so far. Cotton sweaters have a faded dye\u2014almost like a sunburn or a washout, the consequence of polar glare. Pants have a snowboard kick, and jackets are technical, insulated, but most of all, interesting (see a super-cropped glacial blue bomber paired with statement, elbow-reaching gloves). The clothes, very much like Ahn herself, retain a relaxed but decisive character. Lastly, the jewelry: This is where Ahn\u2019s creativity physically shines. She noted that charms sell well; for Fall, she\u2019s added scorpions, spiders, a lightbulb, even a clasp that holds a plastic water bottle. Chain links were inset with pav\u00e9 crystals, and lighter holders returned. But most satisfying were USB sticks plated in silver or gold.

There is no rock music without rebellion.\u201d He furthered that by citing the period, and youth-driven fervor, around the emergence of the Antwerp Six circa the early 1980s (Demeulemeester was one of them). \u201cThe time was full of super-activity, and it was a bit anarchic,\u201d said Meunier. \u201cI went for something that had this energy, a big mix, more rock, and less romantic, than what I\u2019ve done before.\u201d It was indeed a more texturally and chromatically varied Ann Demeulemeester show than what\u2019s become expected of the house. Though, in that, the collection did not sacrifice the label\u2019s signature . . . let\u2019s call it louche nostalgia. Velvety elongated shirts, in ruby or emerald, flowed with an after-hours sense of go-with-it ease, likewise bathrobe-silhouette tops and coats.

Floral jacquards, shearling, bandanas, and fur accents rounded the \u201cbig mix\u201d Meunier was aiming for, and all together, as strobe lights flashed and Siouxsie and the Banshees pumped through the sound system, one felt that rock \u2019n\u2019 roll feedback.

That physical gesture of support is key to the Art School dynamic\u2014it\u2019s about a movement as much as the clothes. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of community within the show itself,\u201d said Eden Loweth, who, with Tom Barratt, has been instrumental in rewriting the language of fashion in London over the past two years. It\u2019s hard to compute that it was only in 2017 that Art School placed gender-nonbinary performance presentations in the fashion domain with their first Fashion East show, which was choreographed by Theo Adams Company. They\u2019ve since been part of the collaborative wave of expression of LGBTQI identities in London fashion that was initially formed by the caravan of creative people led by Charles Jeffrey with his Loverboy shows. This time Art School were out on their own, flown the Fashion East nest for their first stand-alone show. Perhaps that\u2019s why they reached for a posh, grown-up, establishment idea: a night at the Opera, rather than Vogue Fabrics, the Dalston club night that is second home to the young queer culture of London. Quite a good trope to cover the fact that Art School\u2019s chief thing has turned out to be eveningwear, whether glittery dresses or tailoring. The term glad rags could have been coined for it. There were developments of their asymmetrical bias-cut dagger dresses, new skirts in giant gold paillettes, a gold-foiled belted safari suit, and big-skirted cotton gowns. The ragged bit? Fragmentary velvet dresses with jagged holes, and cutaway T-shirts. On heads: What might have read as off-kilter top hats were actually constructed by Shiori Takahashi from old boots and other trash can detritus. In fact, as a program note told us, they were \u201cfound objects . . . created from disregarded, repurposed lost property from queer spaces across London.\u201d Each work comes with a label indicating the area from which it was inspired. So, that\u2019s progress, then. There is at least one more welcoming place, now: catwalk fashion, an arena in which Art School has brought the terms gender nonbinary and trans into mainstream discussion. Remarkable that this has happened in the space of only 24 months.

This was a transition collection, fascinating if you follow the hieroglyphics of the designer. For those who expect her to do one thing, and just that, it might have been a confusing topic-swerve.

Under no obligation, he replied. \u201cI think we are living in a world where everybody starts to pick a fight for no reason, just for the sake of the comments. And I think this is dangerous.

Rousteing, after Ozwald Boateng at Givenchy, the second creative director of color in Paris, and a man raised by (loving) adoptive white parents in a predominantly Caucasian town, knows a fair bit about being on the outside looking in. He has worked his way from the fringes to the heart of the fashion world he loves, and tonight he used his collection to make a statement not only about perspective in a digital world\u2014many of his models wore iPhones on metal-hardware leather harnesses, faced out on the chest, to express a sense of scrutiny returned\u2014but about gender. \u201cI want women to have the same power as the men and I want men to be able to discover their feminine sides . . . in the collection there is both men and women and you cannot necessarily tell by the clothes who was the woman and who is the man. It is kind of like there is one gender.\u201d On the runway that translated into a long opening section, all monochrome, that played with old-man and old-woman eveningwear\u2014satin lapeled tuxedos and boucl\u00e9 jackets\u2014by mixing up both their contexts via gender-swapping and altering their gait through the addition of sportswear and military details. On women, this produced a very effective fresh iteration of Le Smoking, wide-shouldered and defined above the waist, but loosely tapered and sneaker-booted below: Saint Laurent touched by Yohji Yamamoto. The boys, conversely, were often clad in boucl\u00e9\u2014just French for tweed, after all\u2014in hybridized parkas and bikers. Personally\u2014very personally\u2014I absolutely abhor the saggy-assed, narrow-legged drop-crotch pant that Rousteing recurrently raises and to which he returned tonight, but it was presented in a context that made sense. And hey, freedom. Later there were softly stenciled leathers with scrawled implorings that went back to Basquiat (although nobody owns scrawls) on bikers that went back to Schott (how did they not copyright that design), plus houndstooth (the beautiful broken check born in Scotland) on hybrid suiting and ingenious skeleton cut-out sneakers on a German Army (out of copyright, and used by everyone) template. At the end the models wearing iPhones facing outwards came and faced the audience: boys dressed like girls dressed as girls dressed like boys watching us watching them."}, {"Designer": "Berluti", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "When Kris Van Assche traveled to the Berluti factory in Ferrara, Italy, he was still trying to get a fix on what might become the thematic algorithm\u2014the heart\u2014of his first runway show for the brand he joined last April. And then he saw it: the huge square marble table at which Berluti\u2019s artisans sit to apply dye and polish up the patina of the shoes for which this 1895-founded company is so renowned. Struck not only by the creamy deep whiteness of the marble, but the circles and blotches left by years\u2019 worth of lovingly applied polishes\u2014flecks of pink and blue and orange and green and red\u2014Van Assche knew he had stumbled upon the key with which to unlock his new iteration of Berluti. \u201cI totally, totally love the contrast of the noble and the rough. So we photographed it, and it became a print on the silk shirts, suits, and coats\u2014we didn\u2019t retouch it at all. And all those colors provided the palette for the rest of the collection,\u201d Van Assche explained. To show how fundamental he feels the patina is, the designer\u2019s first look was a hand-cut suit in patinated brown leather. The technique used to apply the richly layered fluctuating densities of color was different to that used on a Berluti shoe\u2014say an Alessandro or an Andy\u2014because on the suit it would have stained the clothing worn beneath it. Both through his use of color drawn from the stains on the patina table and this first suit, Van Assche was building a connection between the accessories upon which Berluti was founded and the clothes he now becomes the third designer charged with producing. Like Haider Ackermann before him, Van Assche populated this show\u2014the only exclusively masculine house in the LVMH group\u2014with plenty of women. With the exception of a rib-knit dress in complementary shades of blue, women-worn outfits were variations of the menswear. The final looks, simultaneously presented on both genders, were a brace of black suits: Van Assche is Van Assche. Unlined kangaroo-hide trenches, some a rich red russet, some a soft throbbing fluctuation of several colors\u2014plus a great astrakhan-effect gray shearling, a black croc bomber, and several leather hoodie and track pant looks\u2014supplied the powerfully animal accent you\u2019d expect from a house that stands on its heritage in leather. Paneled moto pants stamped with the year of the company\u2019s founding were worn beneath table-print shirting and strong-shouldered, tailored jackets or overcoats in some of the brightest tones in the kaleidoscope. Often these came with leather shoe tassels attached to the lapel by a safety pin brooch. A gray leather trenchcoat over a charcoal city suit and a dark gray suit in a jacquard of irregular black clouds were looks in which Van Assche explored a darker aspect of patina. The shoes, all important, were bold adaptations of the Alessandro, radically sliced to produce an irregular chisel-toe shape, often emphasized with metal plates that shined under the spotlights, another play on patina. White sneakers came in the same shape. The stealth submarine toe shape was reflected in the molded leather bags\u2014richly patinated, naturally\u2014slung across many of the looks here. This first in-the-wild display of Berluti 3.0\u2014the Van Assche update\u2014explored a series of interesting dialectics: between the shine and depth of patina, between the differences and overlaps in accessories and clothing; and between the expressively idiosyncratic appeal of the brand\u2019s core products and its position in a highly formalized luxury menswear sector."}, {"Designer": "Boss", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "In a season of tailoring, what will motivate women to buy their suits from Boss? The brand has its name recognition, heritage, and quality going for it, but lots of designers are coming for Boss\u2019s market share. Some of them are making \u00fcber-luxe hand-stitched suits that hark back to the earliest days of men\u2019s tailoring. Other designers are deconstructing, reassembling, and exploding the proportions of their suits with no regard for tradition whatsoever. Boss\u2019s suits are somewhere in between: a mix of classic silhouettes, luxe materials, and interesting, of-the-moment tweaks. Backstage after his Fall 2019 show, chief brand officer Ingo Wilts explained his \u201ccurated\u201d approach to the men\u2019s and women\u2019s collections. He was inspired by actual art curators and the New Yorkers who frequent their galleries on Thursday nights. They\u2019re not wearing hoodies and jeans; they\u2019re dressed up, but still feel relaxed. They\u2019re into arty touches and would appreciate Wilts\u2019s two-tone trousers, patchwork shearlings, color-blocked knits, and sturdy boots. More broadly, he said he wanted everything to simply feel soft. There were new cocoon-like silhouettes, both for men and women\u2014see: the men\u2019s long quilted ivory puffer and the women\u2019s voluminous camel cape\u2014and the suits on each side were just barely loosened up. One women\u2019s suit combined a long, gently oversize navy blazer with ultra-slim bootcut trousers. The contrast looked good, and the look will inspire many women to wear their suits with thick-heeled boots, not stilettos. Still, Wilts\u2019s challenge each season is to show off Boss\u2019s prowess beyond tailoring. The sculptural wool dresses\u2014an extension of suiting, in a way\u2014had a cozy, polished appeal, and Sasha Pivovarova\u2019s mercurial satin finale dress looked surprisingly red carpet\u2013worthy."}, {"Designer": "Bottega Veneta", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Daniel Lee\u2019s runway debut was a long time coming; the 32-year-old C\u00e9line alum was appointed Bottega Veneta\u2019s new creative director last June. In the interim, Lee presented a Pre-Fall collection in the company\u2019s Milan headquarters that indicated he was well acquainted with the Bottega DNA\u2014it\u2019s a leather specialist with a proprietary intrecciato weave\u2014and that he\u2019s not afraid to blow it up. Literally. Along with a distinctive square-toe pump and boot, the maxi intreccio totes were the pre-collection\u2019s big takeaway: distinctive and identifiable without resorting to logo branding. The house motto of old was \u201cwhen your own initials are enough.\u201d At today\u2019s show, held in a clear tent with the sun blazing, the benches were decorated with leather cushions in that maxi intreccio pattern. They\u2019re a useful signifier for Lee\u2019s approach to his first big gig: He respects the house\u2019s heritage, but he\u2019s got an independent streak. The designer wasn\u2019t doing interviews today, but at the Pre-Fall appointment, he said, \u201cI like real clothes. I think there\u2019s a need for a return to elegance and sophistication.\u201d This collection was far bolder than that statement suggests. For the Philophiles wondering, it wasn\u2019t a straight-up C\u00e9line redux either. The show started with a black leather tank dress cut with a simplicity that belied the experimentation that would come later. Lee worked leather in all sorts of ways: quilting it into a slim puffer coat with a chain belt, laser-cutting it into small squares linked loosely together on skirts and more tightly on outerwear, and bonding it (apparently) with neoprene to create the look of motocross gear. The biker leather was more believable on the men. Knitwear was a big part of Lee\u2019s vision for both genders, and it produced the collection\u2019s most desirable pieces: subtly sexy sweater dresses with cutaway clavicle-exposing necklines, and another double-layer dress in black and white of twisting, complicated construction that nonetheless looked like it will be easy to wear. A scoop-neck sweater had a substantial gold chain built in. The guys got clingy, asymmetrical, double-layered knits of their own. They\u2019re not a conservative, bourgeois proposition. Neither was Lee\u2019s tailoring. His women\u2019s jackets were cut with a raised collar, which created a strongly sloping shoulder line, or, more compellingly, they were lapel-less with gold hardware at the neckline that created a graceful cut-out framed with leather. For the men, there were narrow, almost two-dimensional sleeves that extended well past the wrists and a pronounced shoulder line that put Martin Margiela in mind. Most of this marched out on sturdy lug sole boots\u2014real stompers. A lot of what was on the runway was directional enough to challenge the eye, or at least to challenge what we expect from Bottega Veneta. This was an ambitious debut, full of risks. We don\u2019t get a lot of those these days.

Similar to their previous three collections, this latest offering tapped into their shared Caribbean heritage (Cura\u00e7ao on his side, the Dominican Republic on hers) and Amsterdam influence.

There was an additional layer, one that developed from their acute observations of refugees throughout Paris, and more specifically, their resourcefulness with clothing.

The fact that one side of the face appeared smiling and the other scowling gives you a good sense of Botter\u2019s underlying tone. Several creations showcased a lively legerdemain, whether the electric green puffer that began as a pair of pants with arms filling out the legs, or jacket panels placed upside down, or the application of adjustable flaps. While these experiments may not be functionally necessary, they had next-gen Margiela appeal. \u201cWe like to search for the boundaries in menswear and cross them a little bit or not cross them\u2014just play around, and not only with shape but also with fabrics,\u201d Botter said. Which brings us to the undisputed hero piece: an outerwear jacket that spoofs a preppy polo shirt, its piqu\u00e9 pink and green stripes meticulously bonded to a sculpted, neoprene-like material. An actual polo with frayed edges made just as much impact. The duo hinted that the Do you see us now T-shirt was mainly directed to those who doubted Botter\u2019s potential. Touch\u00e9.

Stumpfl said: \u201cLucas was my teacher. He taught me everything about fabrics and cuts\u2014he is a real designer.\u201d And so say all of us. That education became apparent as Stumpfl toured us through his first-season panoply of luxury menswear, highlights of which included a greatcoat with crocodile under-collar in a robust, floury finished camel cashmere wool mix; suede and leather shirts and pants with a new, near-invisible seaming technique involving a complicated bias-cut stitch; a check seersucker suit so pared-down that the jacket weighed just 340 grams; Japanese denim lined with cotton checks; silk-paisley-lined soft-shouldered cashmere jackets; a cashmere and wool hoodie lined in shaved mink; Norwegian shoes in cordovan leather (the bit from the horse\u2019s ass) handmade in the waterproof veldtschoen construction; and knit Astrakhan jackets and gilets over cashmere cotton track pants\u2014plus a sweetly Astaire-ish tailed evening suit and a very Prince Harry morning suit.

So there\u2019s no need to change the winning formula; the Fall collection was actually a riff on familiar style territory.

Cucinelli is definitely the detail-obsessed type; to receive his seal of approval, everything must be perfectly in balance. The color of the silk pocket square, perfectly folded and tucked in the pocket of his fitted corduroy blazer, had to be just so; the stripes of the crisp poplin shirts must be exactly the right width. The cashmere turtlenecks, which this season were worn as a leitmotif under the slightly more generously proportioned jackets, passed muster only when their hues obliged to his favorite color chart of neutrals. Cucinelli, as fond as he is of celebrating traditions, usually doesn\u2019t indulge in vintage references; yet this collection had a distinctive retro flavor, expressed in a few \u201950s-inspired style accents. Marlon Brando was assigned the starring role as the collection\u2019s style influencer, with his generously cut, enveloping coats and comfortable suits worn with nonchalance over tees or jumpers tucked into wide-leg pants. These retro-tinged ingredients were translated into a general sense of debonair comfort permeating the lineup, where the fit of blazers and trousers had slightly looser proportions than usual.

Specifically, said Dainty, the duo sought to \u201cdevelop a range based on traditional British menswear looks, while challenging both expected dress codes and masculinity overall. It was inspired a lot by my childhood in Essex, and Ben\u2019s in Bristol.\u201d Broadly, the impression hit an all too rare sweet spot: It\u2019s not often that you see sportswear that looks fresh, especially in this day and age where sportswear is ubiquitous. Cottrell and Dainty have become adept at making tracksuits, which they call their signature, but Fall expanded well beyond that\u2014with sharp editing, a solid execution, and a fair amount of heart, to boot. As their runway was deeply below street level, let\u2019s start from the ground up: the shoes. One editor cleverly remarked on the way out that the footwear, made in collaboration with Reebok, might be called a \u201csneafer\u201d: a lovechild of the ugly-sneaker trend with a loafer. Much as the world might be sick of the ugly sneaker, these were nonetheless strong. Then, there were the trousers, which were consistent highlights. They came cropped and in crushed-velvet-mimicking denim, which in turn mimicked the moss that grew and crept along the set\u2019s edges. Or they came high-waisted and semitranslucent. Or they came in chartreuse yellow with extruded pockets, like some kind of futuristic cargo pant. Outerwear\u201410 pieces of which were made in collaboration with the Italian firm Allegri\u2014was also notable, like with an intriguing off-the-shoulder-but-still-attached double parka in Yves Klein blue or a bathrobe coat in yellowy-green sheepskin. Placed throughout were flashes of hyperconscious tweaking; altered pockets with exposed zips, and even random, flashy embroideries of Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and Lotus logos, sartorial odes, perhaps, to a young man from Essex or Bristol\u2019s ultimate status symbol. But what really made Fall gel was the clarity with which it came together, and the subsequent provocation that that clarity ignited\u2014it\u2019s a fascinating thing, when designers work off of their own personal backgrounds, particularly their youths. The catwalk featured two sculptures that looked like covered birdcages, with lichen growing up their sides and water spouting out of their tops (denoting what? Perhaps an old memory suddenly bursting to the forefront?).

Ton\u2019s take on the traditional two-piece is not all that traditional, however. The jacket is buttonless (its closures are on the inside) and the trousers fit a little like straight-leg jeans. Its color is a steely gray that reads a bit lilac in certain light. Ton and Tsao haven\u2019t entirely rewritten the Deveaux playbook, though. And that\u2019s a good thing.

A great deal of this collection, however, bore a less heavily stamped house signature and instead took time to explore, luxuriate in, and subtly update archetypical tropes of masculine dressing from the interwar years. The whole vibe was back-to-analog. At the end of the stage, company tailoring workers gave fittings and made alterations. A finely spoken English master of ceremonies provided a running commentary of each section\u2014sometimes reverting to serviceable Italian\u2014just as you imagine the first menswear shows at Pitti in the 1950s would have been narrated on the newsreels. Opening black and white sections presented a distinctly late-1920s to 1930s silhouette of strong shouldered short jackets and straight-legged wide pants, which were updated\u2014and slightly 1990s-ified\u2014via a heavy break at the leg. A passing cluster of heavily pomaded models in silk pajama suits printed with fountain pens or umbrellas (which along with ornately handled swagger sticks featured heavily as accessories) presented the notion of this man as a collector and aesthete. A new D&G logo in Art Deco font that resembled the personal monogram of some Rockefeller or Mellon from way back when featured on country-club knits above tweed check pants in the same high-waisted wide shape, but worn for the sake of contemporaneousness with sneakers instead of saddle shoes.

We have lost this sense of elegance recently\u2014fashion is the mirror of the time\u2014and of course we do sportswear and mix and match too. But we\u2019ve found that a lot of the guys we have worked recently with get very excited at the prospect of wearing an amazing suit or a tuxedo\u2014a really strong suit or a tuxedo, not something boring\u2014because that is not something that is so available to them.

With the exception of an excellent technical denim ski/snow section, two mountain-rescue parkas, and two down jackets in water-repellent velvet (plus the all-EA7 white ski and snowboard section near the end), not much in this collection was explicitly technical in the utilitarian sense.

There was a recurring return to blanket-like scarves with pockets used as outer-outerwear (jankets?) and a compelling intro to the business suiting section in a three-piece jersey suit that looked as flexible in the wearing as any technical piece, but retained the authority of its origins. The suits, when they came included a pinstriped single breasted with cuffed pants, plus a few suits cut much more closely to the body and with a far more pronounced shoulder than in recent seasons. These were teamed with shirts and ties whose tumultuously styled collar arrangements hinted at the tooth-and-claw appearance of the earlier faux-fur-led section.

What if all the so-close-but-not-quites of modern life evaporated and the cuff of your pants hit perfectly above your sneaker, and the chest rig vest fit snuggly under or over that corduroy blazer? Wouldn\u2019t that make life easier? That is the general principle of Engineered Garments, a brand that takes its commitment to function so seriously, it\u2019s literally in the name. With workwear on the rise, and on the backs of everyone from Daniel Day-Lewis to Brooklyn Beckham, the moment is right for Engineered Garments. What sets designer Daiki Suzuki\u2019s vision of supreme functionality apart from more mass makers of painter pants and button-downs is his artistry and devotion to materials. This season, Suzuki drew from the New Romantics, cutting a loose silhouette in velvet, wide-weft corduroy, and rich brocades alongside the more standard-fare cottons and a custom double-face dull satin inspired by army fatigues. A jacket comes with a button detail pulled from Tyrolean coats, while another outerwear piece is a supersize take on medical gowns. It\u2019s all just peculiar enough to stand out but just normal enough to qualify as everyday wear\u2014and it all fits together like a garmento\u2019s jigsaw puzzle.

Inside\u2014oh Lord\u2014there was a group of Etro-clad interpretive mime artists, some wearing plain white masks, some wearing plain white masks with long gray beards. There are few things less liable to make you feel self-conscious than a mime artist mimicking you while you work\u2014in this case your reporter was feeling the pile on one of those aforementioned piumini and checking the jacquard on the suit below it.

There was a dreamy fairy-tale theme running through the decorations in jacquard, print, or embroidery on these pieces\u2014dragons, unicorns, slightly freaky fairies, and the like\u2014which also presumably informed the Legolas vibe in the casting of this lookbook. There were some pretty forest-print parkas and a bomber jacket decorated with alchemical symbols in metal thread. The reality part of the the collection lay in its fabrication. That wonderful brushed overcoat in a dark, rich check was entirely made of recycled fabric, the boldly decorated oxford shirting was made in sustainably produced eucalyptus fiber, or bamboo, as well as \u201cbiological\u201d cotton drawn from producers working to make this especially wasteful material less so.

Stefan Cooke and his partner, Jake Burt, didn\u2019t exaggerate when they dropped those words into the description of their collection\u2014it was one of those occasions when mouths gaped open at the skill and originality of a fully formed, completely desirable vision of fashion walking by. Just take it from the bright white torso-hugging, zipped-up leather shirt that seemed as if it might be a ribbed knit at first, but turned out to be made of vertically slashed strips of leather with delicately serrated edges\u2014and which also seemed to be connected to a white fringed peplum. But then that again was an eye trick, being in fact a wraparound print on the top of a pair of trousers. Whoa to Look 31. And whoa to the rest of what Cooke and Burt did: argyle knits that left peepholes in the lozenge patterns; seamlessly fitted jersey trousers made in that vertically slashed leather; silver chain-mail stoles casually flung over tailoring; ingeniously slashed English dad coats\u2014the lot of it, actually. But how did they do that? Backstage, Cooke and Burt were bubbling over with irrepressible glee in describing how they came up with the leather technique\u2014the last look, a red coat, was concertina-ed across the musculature of the model\u2019s back, to show bare skin in a diamond pattern. \u201cWell, it was finding an old Chelsea boot from a charity shop and looking at its worn-out strips of elastic,\u201d Burt began. \u201cAnd then we got this Lycra and applied the leather on top,\u201d said Cooke, \u201cand then we sliced it all through with rotary pinking shears!\u201d Presto! The discovery of a technique that invents incredibly chic male leggings (meggings?) and other garments that stretch to show either a different base color, or skin, as they move. It didn\u2019t for a second read as a textile-geeky gimmick. These things sometimes do. Nope: The amazing surface effects were trained to engineer an impressive, sexy, classy sense of the way a young man would kill to look. Cooke came out of the Central Saint Martins M.A. program in 2017 and got together with his school friend Burt to start presenting his body-hugging trompe l\u2019oeil preppy-classic silhouettes on the Fashion East runway. The challenge with coming up with a brilliant idea over five years in college is: What will be your next trick? Some people only have one. Cooke and Burt proved with this collection that they have the rare dynamic talent to keep coming up with new ideas, while twisting and twirling around their original ones\u2014like minimizing, exploding, or cutting out their argyles, or messing about with chain mail in unique ways. This is the last of the three-season Stefan Cooke tenure on the Fashion East runway. That\u2019s why, Cooke laughed, they came up with the wacky colored wires draped on some of the boys: \u201cWe thought they looked like party streamers!\u201d These two can allow themselves a moment to celebrate. They have their heads screwed on: a vision of being able to make small orders of their high-intensity, elaborate pieces, and then being able to offer the printed things at more accessible prices. It\u2019s the fun and uniqueness that will give them a bright future. Burt put the attraction in a nutshell: \u201cWe\u2019ve placed everything really, really carefully on each garment. Like, we were the ones that placed it on you and no one else.\u201d As Lulu Kennedy is waving off the Stefan Cooke duo, she\u2019s also waved in two newbies this season.

It was at Casa Fendi\u2014the real one\u2014in Rome. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what he was doing,\u201d she reminisced this afternoon. \u201cI thought he was a painter.\u201d In a working relationship that goes back to 1965 (way before Chanel was but a twinkle in his eye), Lagerfeld has become profoundly insinuated within the fabric of both the Fendi business and family. Or as Venturini Fendi put it today: \u201cIn my fantasy world, he is the only man related to Fendi. So yes, he is the man in my life.\u201d Given that, it\u2019s surprising that what came to pass at today\u2019s Fendi menswear show has not happened previously. Lagerfeld was both the inspiration for, and a contributor to, the collection, the latest and most prominent in the series of guest star collaborations that have marked recent seasons here. For the collection, Lagerfeld sketched a strong-shouldered double-breasted jacket with a shawl collar on the right side and a notch on the left. This in-your-face asymmetry in a menswear genre typically defined by symmetry\u2014tailoring\u2014was one starting point for the series of complementarily opposing dualities that ran throughout the lineup: the half-and-half jackets, the interplay of calligraphic monogram and futurist logo, the kinkily veiled back-and-forth between transparency and shine. Also influential was the personal style of Lagerfeld himself: a play in several acts that included his Caraceni years, his Japanese interludes (Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Undercover, Number (N)ine), and the Dior Homme coup. Even the physical mementos of Venturini Fendi\u2019s almost lifelong collaboration with Lagerfeld were included here. The collage print on suitcases, plastic trenches, and a voluminous seamless piumino were made up of a lovingly assembled cache of the notes and images the designer has sent her over the years. This collection was a wearable expression of Lagerfeld\u2019s encyclopedic knowledge and history of self-expression through menswear\u2014indeed, the show space was a re-creation of his personal library in Paris\u2014but it was not an homage or an exercise in costume design. Certainly you could never imagine him wearing any of the metallic technical outerwear pieces, sometimes in organza overlay for extra shine. As Venturini Fendi noted, \u201cI have never seen him wearing sportswear; he is always wearing tailoring in a contemporary way.\u201d What the use of Lagerfeld achieved so cleverly here was to remind us that while tailoring might seem like old hat right now, it is a dynamic form that constantly evolves. Venturini Fendi declared that she would love to see a younger client discovering that dynamism, which is perhaps why\u2014as a pretty hard-to-resist sweetener\u2014she teamed many of the tailored looks with what she said was the first-ever-for-men iteration of the Baguette. Redesigned in collaboration with the Japanese technical luggage specialist Porter-Yoshida & Co. to be harnessable at the waist (or, of course, slung cross-shoulder), it came in various sizes and fabrications\u2014nylon, crocodile, shearling, metallic leathers, and more. Inspired by the man in Venturini Fendi\u2019s life, this collection deserves to find a place in the lives of many other men, too."}, {"Designer": "Giorgio Armani", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "For tonight\u2019s coed Giorgio Armani show we moved across Via Bergognone to the Armani Silos, the sprawling exhibition complex the designer opened pretty much at the same time that Prada opened its Fondazione in 2015. Titled Rhapsody in Blue, the collection was a languid exploration of smoky reliefs and pencil-sharp silhouettes played out on a dark mirrored runway. With the occasional exception of a padded velvet overcoat over a hammered silk shirt (in blue), or a chevron-etched suede bomber (in blue) or a large-hooded piumino over a pant of puckered crushed velvet (blue too), the menswear here\u2014via a section of luxury utilitywear accented by leather-framed safety goggles\u2014mostly stayed true to the key architecture that Armani both revolutionized and revived: suiting. It went from an opening section of Vitruvian-precise double-breasteds into a loose trousered flirtation with single-breasted jackets into a blue-busting section of black tuxedos. The more exuberant ornamentation came in the womenswear. Atop pants cut slim or with jodhpur eruptions at the quad, Armani served a pre-millennial nightclub\u2019s worth of smoky whorl and twist. From the bunched swirls of leather on the square-toed boots to the glinting shivers of midnight blue pattern under mesh on jerkin tops, or the hard exhalations of leather ruffle on handbag straps, or the meandering back-and-forths of leather peplum, this was an overwhelmingly dark collection packed with playful decoration. Bow-belted pleated pants were served south of a silk shirt in shifting clouds of midnight blue. A double-ruffled leather collar furled forth from the neckline of a leather-piped black velvet jacket. The swirls slowly settled into abstract flowers etched in purple beads or mirrored enamel, before an evening section featuring one multitiered narrow-cut gown but which focused mostly on velvet pants and extravagantly decorated one-shoulder tops."}, {"Designer": "Givenchy", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Clare Waight Keller is an incredibly fluent and conversational public speaker. This morning, she walked across the parquet floor of the Givenchy couture showroom, stuck her hands in her marine blue trouser pockets, and gave a small group of guests a complete and personal explanation of her \u201cdeep dive\u201d into menswear. \u201cI went into my own self, really, back into the \u201990s, and how I felt when I was really young, how we\u2019d dress on not a lot of money. At Givenchy we have young Parisians from schools here, and there\u2019s this same perverse poshness, wearing tailoring in a really sharp way, with a shirt or T-shirt,\u201d she said. \u201cQuite clean, really.\u201d In other words, a new kind of youthful aspiration\u2014to look smart and gorgeous no matter what\u2014is coming down the line, taking menswear up several significant fashion notches from the commonplaces of the street. \u201cTo me, Givenchy is an elevated house,\u201d she said. Even in distressed times, with luxury stores under attack from the \u201cgilets jaunes\u201d every Saturday, the world still looks to Paris to take the lead when it craves a chic idea of how to dress. Waight Keller\u2014British as she is\u2014nailed that frisson in the single- and double-breasted, flared-trouser suits she sent out. If you wanted to get intellectual about it they might have seemed like a gender blend between Hubert de Givenchy and Audrey Hepburn, in those famous pictures of them casually strolling as friends along the Seine\u2014when tailored flared trousers and belted trenchcoats were the quintessential Thing. But relevant fashion is always about designers hitting the right time, not trotting out house costume themes\u2014and this suit resonated on multiple frequencies. Take the flared trousers. In a way, the over-the-shoe thing they had going on indeed evoked what poor boys wore in the \u201990s, but they were also calibrated precisely to a certain elegant slimness in the leg. Waight Keller attributed this to the \u201csoftness and fluidity I like for men,\u201d and put it down to the \u201ccrossover palette I dip into\u201d from the womenswear into the menswear. There was a lot else in the show\u2014including an oversize peacoat with painted buttons, a parka in slick black, and a reflective-tissue trenchcoat. But to project an intended trajectory, you need the conviction of one strong and definite look. Those suits\u2014and specifically those Givenchy trousers\u2014did that. Dads and grandads everywhere will feel a pang to look at them. Much as they\u2019ll chuckle about wearing such suits in their youth, unfortunately they really can\u2019t now.

A man in a sculpted-waist officer\u2019s coat (with mock backpack straps applied to it) and a woman in a similarly dyed, logo-smattered blazer might very well have been the cocaptains of this scorched-earth abdication. There was also somewhat of a decadence in the departure; a dry Champagne-color suit glinted in the overhead lights and broke generously at the knee, giving the pant a sort of flowing boot-cut shape. Likewise, a long-sleeved dress in steely blue had GmbH\u2019s floral and metal motifs printed through the torso\u2014evacuation, but make it evening.

Then there were the masks: Jason Voorhees masks, fetish store masks with 2-inch-long spikes, a stupendous brass eagle with talons clutching the jawline. At the press conference afterwards, Michele explained his fascination, saying, \u201cA mask is hollow but also full.\u201d It conceals and reveals; it\u2019s a defense and a welcome sign; disorienting and its opposite.

But he sees clothes in the same way; they\u2019re the means by which we become what we feel we are, an open possibility. Michele gave us plenty to mediate on, especially in the context of the recent blackface uproar surrounding a Gucci balaclava jumper with a cut-out mouth and red lips. Regarding the incident, Michele said, \u201cThis must be used to create something new; this will help us do things in a different way.\u201d The collection was as \u201cfull of little things\u201d as always, many of them deeply personal\u2014there\u2019s comfort in the familiar, even for a guy as free associative as Michele. He emphasized the sober \u201940s tailoring of his grandmother\u2019s generation in jackets worn by men and women: shoulders sharp, waists nipped, and trouser legs full above ankles cinched with cord. Many of the pieces were unfinished, with basting stitches tracing seams or the outline of outsize lapels, and raw edges elsewhere. Pierrot collars, in contrast, seemed to speak of childhood whimsy and innocence, as did the nonsense words ice, lolly, and sucker that appeared throughout. Different identities to slip into and out of as easily as a woman changes her Gucci sneakers for mismatched gold and silver platforms. A few of the models carried trainers from the laces, like handbags. Michele called the sneakers \u201cgame changers,\u201d for the way they\u2019ve liberated women from heels. There were none of the Major League Baseball references he\u2019s used of late, and logos for the most part were eliminated.

Recently, the designer has been feeling the need to get back to something more real\u2014\u201ctraditional French workwear,\u201d he said, \u201cbakery guys, farm workers. They are real, real clothes, cotton, wool.\u201d He said the subject made him feel awkward about having a show\u2014a general mood of questioning the formats of fashion. He did it anyway but tried to inject an idea of nonurban reality into his presentation. Jacquemus and his models arrived in a white truck outside the Palais de Tokyo\u2014as if arriving from the country\u2014and, after a turn around the gallery, sat down to eat breakfast at a rustic table laden with bread, cheese, and coffee. The playful slice-of-life spontaneity of it had typical Jacquemus directness and charm. It was full of relatable outdoor boy-basics, interleaved with whimsical embroidery\u2014a wheat sheaf on a linen overshirt and faded prints of rosemary sprigs on a white Sunday-best suit. Jacquemus shows are often suffused with youthful romanticism, but this one had a grittier poignancy. The erosion of traditional occupations\u2014and the divisive tensions which have boiled up in the regions\u2014is precisely the issue which is fueling the Gilets Jaunes protests in Paris and across France. \u201cThere is no political message, but I am from the countryside, from a farmer family,\u201d said Jacquemus. \u201cI was born with these guys, these Gilets Jaunes. So all these messages about people\u2019s suffering, I understand them. I feel close to them. But it\u2019s a bit wrong to have a message in a fashion show on a Sunday morning.\u201d Still, there was a nuance which spoke volumes: The worker boys he brought to breakfast were a completely diverse crew. \u201cI grew up with North African kids, but also my family is mixed\u2014my sister has French and Algerian roots,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, this is the France of today.\u201d Jacquemus is plowing his own field in fashion as a burgeoning successful young entrepreneur and employer, and, at a time when far-right racism is rearing its ugly head, he added an affirmative subtext to his love letter to the country he comes from."}, {"Designer": "Jil Sander", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cWe were really into the idea of looking at tailoring,\u201d said Lucie Meier immediately before this show. \u201cHow to wear tailoring today.

Suitably, the collection took place in the Navy Yard of Brooklyn in a dimly lit, wet-floored industrial warehouse used to make modular homes. The show focused around a skeleton of a house from which the models emerged. The unfinished space fit neatly with Elliott\u2019s experiments in process, among them a padded jacket nicely faded so that missing patches left ghostly marks, akin to removing furniture from a weathered deck; and a bomber jacket made from insulation-like material in a method so exacting that it can\u2019t be produced in large quantities. An abstract print on polar fleece derived from Elliott\u2019s grandparents\u2019 own wallpaper, and a laboriously stitched floor-length poncho could have been lifted from an old homespun rug. A proprietary tie-dye technique involved bleaching rolls of fabric and overdyeing it with rich indigo; otherwise the palette remained in the moody zone of misty-gray, green, and sand. Elliott\u2019s myriad collaborations returned as well, including those curiously seamless down jackets with Descente and leather biker jackets with Blackmeans, both Japanese companies, plus two new shades, brown and black, of his runaway-hit sneaker with Nike, the LeBron James x John Elliott Icon. Add to that an entirely new apparel collaboration with Caterpillar, a sleek departure from the construction company\u2019s bulky connotations. Elliott said he was going for a long and black look so that it could segue into night. Very Hitchcockian. As a whole, this was Elliott\u2019s elevated streetwear elevated further\u2014a familiar wardrobe wrapped in concept. The women\u2019s side, introduced more recently and now fully incorporated, seemed to have found its place as a feminized version of men\u2019s, but not too removed from the unisex silhouette that streetwear demands. The matured vision will need a home to call its own. Enter Elliott\u2019s just-signed new store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, where his line is based and manufactured, opening this Spring.

That may sound a bit boring, but the often convincing thing with Joseph is that, even though it looks straightforward at first glance, there are usually details that give its offerings a little something extra. This is helpful in a consumer landscape where it feels like there is so, so much of the same thing available, from high street to the high end. Layered trenches, a puffa greatcoat with argyle-mimicking topstitching, and a sleek jogger pant with a raised cargo pocket at the very top of the left thigh were the best in show, or at least the most singular.

First the men\u2019s, then the women\u2019s collections played out against the backdrop of wildly illustrated murals by the late artist and shaman Pablo Amaringo, with music that was traditional yet trancelike. Many of the visions were intensely saturated and collided urban with expedition elements\u2014hot pink suits, pinstripe outerwear that glinted silver, polar fleece in optical patterns, and a whirling atmospheric motif that was unearthed from the archive.

In the mid-19th century, people of Chinese ancestry settled in Peru; they are referred to as Tus\u00e1n and they now number in the millions. Leon said he still has family there and flew them over for the occasion. They would have likely recognized some of the traditional garments, creatively updated: pollera skirts, now boasting drawstrings and worn with puffer jackets; hot pink ponchos in waterproof technical fabrics; and blanket plaids as workwear shirts or sweaterdresses.

The historic Neapolitan menswear company\u2019s traditions of skilled tailoring and high-quality materials are still firmly in place, even if the style has evolved to accommodate a modern high-spending global demographic.

Apparently, he\u2019s one of the not-so-few outrageously rich Kiton aficionados who can afford its vicu\u00f1a blazers, the label\u2019s jewel of the crown. The vicu\u00f1a mystique is such that the fabric is said to have been used by ancient Inca tribes to wave their kings\u2019 mantles; it\u2019s a precious fiber, produced in extremely limited quantities. Kiton has secured not only a privileged access to vicu\u00f1a suppliers, but also, through the recent acquisition of the prestigious Lanificio Barbera, the facilities to directly control the very production of the made-to-order vicu\u00f1a blazers, which are sought after by clients who can spend \u20ac30,000 to \u20ac50,000 on a jacket.

Divinely soft, smooth, and featherlight, it was cut into relaxed tailored blazers, paired with corduroy pants for luxurious, comfortable ease. Kiton belongs to the long line of Neapolitan tailors whose traditional technique of soft tailoring is at the roots of the laid-back construction now dominating men\u2019s updated formalwear. The label\u2019s repertoire has expanded and morphed into a luxurious hybridization of tailoring and sportswear, which is also offered in made-to-measure iterations. This season, even denim was given the luxury treatment with nutria appliqu\u00e9s, while the streamlined city coats were lined in weasel or mink; what looked like a sporty, outdoorsy fleece jacket was actually made of a thick, sensuous cashmere yarn. In true Italian manner, Kiton is a family business; De Matteis\u2019s twin offspring, Mariano and Walter, also presented their third small collection, called KNT (Kiton New Textures), a line of upscale-cool unstructured urbanwear for a younger, but surely deep-pocketed, clientele.

Another example, in womenswear: a great wool car coat in somber gray, but with bright red adhesive bandages zigzagging atop it. The mountain climbing and patchwork stuff was also convincing and, again, freshly myriad in effect.

Salable items included those hats and a cool tracksuit with emotive calligraphic swirls running down their stripes. Akasaka also partnered this season with Kurabo, a Japanese manufacturer that is able to take the sustainability practices at core of his work and evolve them. Specifically, Kurabo takes the scraps of denim that are cut away in production and respins them into cotton fibers to be used again. Until now, Akasaka had done so by hand, creating his stunning sakiori woven jeans as a conceptual project.

I spotted Bruce Pask of Bergdorf Goodman on the corner, mid-meeting in the Broken Arm, and asked if he was Lemaire-bound. This never-miss-a-trick looked startled at the idea of a presentation not on his spreadsheet. He was right, and we were wrong: It transpired that the presentation was today, Friday, not yesterday. The mistake proved to be serendipitous.

Tran said the school had offered them the space as a consequence of projects the pair were running with current students. \u201cAnd we shot the looks here, too, although you cannot really see it.\u201d Of the collection, Lemaire said: \u201cThere are some references, like Nick Cave. His Birthday Party period, when he used to have his suits made in Hong Kong. Slightly \u201970s.\u201d Tran added: \u201cThe silhouette is maybe more defined, and the shoulder more shaped than in previous seasons.\u201d There was certainly definition in the fiercely creased polyester wool pants worn with same-color work shirts and heavily heeled Portuguese-made boots, which in brown were very like a pair I just-about-remember my grandfather wearing in the 1970s. Teamed with overdyed trenchcoats in rich blue, wide pants, and some desert boots, the headwear (berets produced in collaboration with Laulh\u00e8re) looked as French as French gets but eminently translatable to other more far-flung milieus. There was a further collaboration with English cotton specialists of fine-rib knit T-shirts and vests, as well as Lemaire\u2019s dream pair of midnight-blue-to-black piped pajamas\u2014he was especially excited about these. Felt wool suits and an overcoat in a m\u00e9lange flecked prettily with many different colors. Silk shirting and trousers were printed with irregular lines reminiscent of wood grain. Maybe it was the moustache on one of the models and that kicky-legged \u201970s flavor to the silhouette, but there was something slightly sleazy, yet still decidedly civilized, about the general impression the collection lent\u2014this Lemaire was more louche than usual but as attractive as it so often is. It was also a pleasure, by consequence of a snafu of spreadsheet, to find the designers at a moment of relative ease."}, {"Designer": "Linder", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "For Fall, Linder\u2019s menswear lead, Kirk Millar, filtered his deeply personal take on fashion through anecdotal avatars: the Romanov family. \u201cTheir story is sort of an allegory for the fashion industry,\u201d said the designer in Paris this afternoon. \u201cOnce powerful, but to have that power eradicated . . .\u201d Touchy stuff, but the legend and intrigue around the Romanovs retains plenty of ornateness to diffuse\u2014\u201csort of like the way Sofia Coppola took Marie Antoinette and made it like . . . Los Angeles girls gossiping,\u201d said Millar. The overall point being: Established structures, norms, and ways are not impenetrable, no matter the context, and they eventually either morph . . . or crumble. Millar was trying to find some creative petrol in that, without being too forcibly outspoken. There was lots to like therein. See: diamond-printed spandex\u2014a kind of sicko concept, like armor for the headily wealthy\u2014or na\u00eff-sketch appliqu\u00e9s reinterpreted from drawings Alexei Romanov made long ago. Likewise lightweight boxer-esque shorts with a little cameo detail on the thigh. A lavish handwritten signature appeared on a jumper, while another artwork redux, this time the painting Red Cavalry Riding by Kazimir Malevich, was banded around sleeves and hems. The motif featured horses, which also got Millar thinking about Western tropes; he created semi-\u201cpulpy\u201d-movie poster tees, with the faces of the Romanov family juxtaposed against saloon-style fonts. (Also, worth mentioning, he self-photographed this entire lookbook\u2014an uncommon occurrence with designers.) \u201cI feel that fashion is now missing the catalyst of being able to imagine, or dream wildly, through the images we\u2019re seeing,\u201d concluded Millar. \u201cIt\u2019s a dark theme, but ultimately it\u2019s about the fantasy.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Loewe", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Jonathan Anderson has joined the ramping-up of menswear shows in Paris this season, taking Loewe men\u2019s from an exhibition presentation to a runway format for the first time. \u201cAfter five years, I felt like we needed to show it moving,\u201d he said. \u201cMenswear has quadrupled since we began.\u201d Positioned as backdrop, setting the tone, there was a yellow ocher cloth sculpture by Franz Erhard Walther. His body of work\u2014performances which involve getting people to assemble fabric on their bodies in unconventional ways\u2014is an apt metaphor for Anderson\u2019s knack for abstracting shapes and putting familiar/unfamiliar details in odd places. This time, he\u2019d evolved what looked on first sight to be chaps, which flapped open to add an \u201980s type of volume in the trouser leg. On second, third, and fourth sights, it became clear that they were actually unzipped boots, going all the way up to a belt. Over to Anderson: \u201cWe were looking at gaiters and fishermen. It was early-\u201980, kind of, when we unzipped them. It created kind of flaps\u2014Western, but non-Western. It was how to take something fetish and de-fetishize it.\u201d Plus, they served the purpose of flagging the message: This is a luxury leather house. Here\u2019s the thing about Anderson, though. In one breath, he can be parsing the multiple meanings behind an object, and in the next be speaking merchandise: \u201cHow do you take basics, and make them fashionable? It\u2019s about the border between these two. How do you get a customer to buy just a knit, and get the full impact of it?\u201d The point is that Anderson\u2019s high-concept approach is a deceptively solid framework for unerringly desirable pieces which have people running to get their hands on them. That goes for his own JW Anderson label as well as for the handcrafted ethos he\u2019s installed as central to Loewe\u2019s luxury attraction. Take the variety of knits\u2014running the gamut from a kind of striped caftan to elongated sweaters to a skinny rugby shirt with cashmere track pants in a different striped colorway. Or the simple, genius quirk of a striped blue-and-white shirt with beige shearling popping out of its seams. Or any of the bags showcased here: a cornflower blue leather fanny pack, an enlarged men\u2019s version of the women\u2019s Puzzle bag, to name but two. We haven\u2019t got on to the tailoring yet, but we must: It\u2019s another high-fashion shot in the arm for Loewe\u2019s fashion quotient. Looks were slim in the torso, with wide-ish trousers. A pin-striped iteration had one lapel in white satin. \u201cI like the idea of an Oxford bag, it\u2019s very elegant, I think. We\u2019d done the suit in the women\u2019s collection\u2014we kept the waist, and extended the back,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cThere\u2019s something quite chic and suave about it.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Louis Vuitton", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cLet\u2019s behave like we want the world to be, and not get into the dead end we\u2019re at now.\u201d Virgil Abloh has brought the creative optimism of inclusivity to Louis Vuitton menswear. In a preview, he said that his main objective in dedicating his sophomore show to Michael Jackson was \u201cnot to make costume, but to take him as backdrop, to make a point about the humanity in his vision. I wanted humanity in the forefront.\u201d He went on: \u201cThe bigger question for me here is why are we making clothes? This is menswear\u2014but what makes men? That\u2019s way more profound.\u201d There was a New York sidewalk set from the \u201cBillie Jean\u201d video, a live performance from Dev Hynes\u2014a lot going on. It\u2019s a been a prerequisite to put on a majorly theatrical, globally impactful performance at Louis Vuitton ever since Marc Jacobs invented awesome immersive experiences as a vehicle for fashion at this house. Job well done, considering all the Instagram-generating buzz surrounding the show. There is so much goodwill around Abloh; his constantly everywhere fame; and his massive, interlocking networks of friends and followers, right through to the ranks of teenage boys who congregated outside the Vuitton show tent in the freezing Paris weather, pleading with the audience as they left for invitations, show notes, anything, as souvenirs of just being there. That is the revolutionary generational reach Louis Vuitton knew it was co-opting when the company hired Abloh: a 21st-century skipping of the old, excluding boundaries between luxury fashion and what kids\u2014boys in particular\u2014passionately care about. But it\u2019s a bigger responsibility\u2014and an ambition that Abloh has in his sights\u2014to rise to the more difficult challenge of contributing something new to fashion. Before he arrived, the industry made its assumptions. \u201cYeah, you know, they thought it would be streetwear,\u201d Abloh chuckled. But no. His aim is elevation, only seen through a new prism. And first, he\u2019s tackling tailoring. \u201cIt takes an intense amount of time to do something subtle,\u201d he observed. The opening looks showed him taking that seriously, in the sophisticated layers of gray suiting\u2014long vests wrapped under blazers, fluid wide pants, a cropped bomber jacket on top of a tailored one. All of a piece, with bags to match. \u201cI wanted this layered level of making, which is actually just beautiful but has depth to it,\u201d he said. The attention to cut was obvious in close-up. A pair of trousers, for instance, came with regular knife-edge pleats, which opened to a flare breaking over the shoe. There were multiple luxurious fabrications and techniques: embossed military cuffs on a leather admiral\u2019s trench, semi-sheer rococo prints on shirts and pajama suits. And later, a take on a houndstooth suit, with a pattern made up of miniaturized maps of Africa. \u201cYeah, I spun the globe,\u201d Abloh said. \u201cYou know, every kid in America draws the map with Europe at the center. This is looking at it from the other direction.\u201d He carried that train of thought\u2014a wholly different lens through which to see Vuitton\u2019s travel heritage\u2014into flag prints, gathered from the nationalities of the people in his studio. \u201cGreat Britain, the USA, Germany, Kazakhstan\u2014and we put in the flag of Michael Jackson\u2019s home state, Indiana,\u201d he noted. To Jackson\u2019s influence: There were crystal-beaded tour jackets, references to the military insignia of his costumes, and an athletic performance by dancer Alton Mason, an avatar for Jackson\u2019s Peter Pan\u2013like fragility, flitting among the models in a purple satin suit. For all the peripherals, there was somehow an atmosphere of gentleness and calmness rather than noise and hype. That comes from Abloh\u2019s personable character, no doubt, but it also spoke to his ability to unite people and new viewpoints in uplifting ways. If only the world\u2019s politicians could be more like him."}, {"Designer": "Maison Kitsun\u00e9", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Of all the brands that #oldceline shoppers might consider for a Philo-esque fix, Maison Kitsun\u00e9 almost certainly wouldn\u2019t come to mind. But with Yuni Ahn\u2019s recent appointment as the creative director of a label more recognized for its music production and fox mascot than for insider-y fashion, there might now be reason to reconsider. In her first role since leaving Celine as design director, Ahn made her Maison Kitsun\u00e9 debut this evening, which also marked the brand\u2019s entrance on the official Paris calendar. Apropos of its Friday evening time slot, the presentation was cohosted by Boiler Room, a popular music platform for techno enthusiasts, with music provided by Paris DJ du jour, Kiddy Smile. Founders Gildas Loa\u00ebc and Masaya Kuroki might be in the midst of upgrading the brand\u2019s positioning\u2014and expanding its worldwide presence\u2014but kudos for sticking to their club-culture roots with this coming-out. Anyway, Ahn revealed she was (maybe still is) a club kid, too. What initially struck Loa\u00ebc, however, was her focus, saying, \u201cShe brings so much savoir faire; she has a really precise eye.\u201d And she also blurred the line between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s collections by proposing unisex layers that lent a streamlined coherence to the look. \u201cThe feeling of being modern comes from choosing the right fabric and the right shape,\u201d she explained, her inky-blue technical blazer with its relaxed tailoring and drawstring waist effectively catching the eye. Back onstage, androgynous models made clear that the brand had graduated from Parisian preppy to global urban. A high-shine black trenchcoat, Prince of Wales down jackets, monochromatic workwear layers, an overall \u201990s influence, and chunky sneakers in collaboration with Brandblack all signaled Maison Kitsun\u00e9 2.0. The brand\u2019s status sweatshirts still looked relevant; only now they featured thick web straps and a tone-on-tone logo\u2014and were shown under a dressy black puffer coat or as a hoodie dress. The cute fox became a kool fox, which was literally spelled out on a graphic jacquard sweater and polo. Ahn gave the girls a smart update on the Lavalli\u00e8re shirt by transforming the bow into an integrated bandana, and wasn\u2019t afraid to elevate looks with enlarged volumes and high-heeled footwear in collaboration with Michel Vivien. Brand reboots can be risky, but truth be told, Maison Kitsun\u00e9 had mostly outgrown its look. Anh\u2019s challenge will be to keep this minimalist cool from creeping towards Uniqlo while also avoiding watered-down old Celine. \u201cI can\u2019t help being that woman,\u201d she conceded of that latter. \u201cI put myself in deeply, so in that way, it is there. But Kitsun\u00e9 is a very different brand; I love the music heritage and I love the playfulness.\u201d It sounds like she\u2019s ready to have some fun."}, {"Designer": "Maison Mihara Yasuhiro", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Mihara Yasuhiro\u2019s translator had stepped away when WWD and I arrived, but we managed to inveigle the man himself into speaking up. He said: \u201cNow I think fashion became a game. And who makes the rules of the fashion game? It is a totally changing game. In my philosophy I believe in creativity in fashion . . . people need intelligence in fashion. Here we have the fake logos. At this time I want to make something and give kind of a \u2018junk\u2019 feeling. Do you know outsider art? Like this . . . today it is the big companies that make the rules in fashion. But I am not a big company. I focus on creation.\u201d Who needs a translator, anyway? This season\u2019s outsider art\u2013inspired accessories included necklaces looped with ephemera such as basin plugs, strings of pearls, a very small saucepan, and feathers. They nicely complimented Yasuhiro\u2019s signature studied mishmash of reconstructions. Shirts were made of two shirts\u2014one a flannel check, say, and the other a work shirt for the fake private-jet company that was one of Yasuhiro\u2019s graphic motifs. They came teamed with a sewn-on tie. An MA-1 was grafted onto a check rain jacket. And so on: single pieces with multiple layers. When a look came that was less reconstructed\u2014a tailored red-on-black check coat over a green corduroy tracksuit\u2014it was almost shocking. Garments were stapled with fake lottery tickets; prints and knits depicted playing card boxes and roulette wheels. Held in the American Cathedral, sound-tracked by the urgent percussion of a having-fun dance troupe, this was a collection resonant with playful echoes and serious implications."}, {"Designer": "Marcelo Burlon County of Milan", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cIt started with this idea of an amusement park that has been abandoned\u2014there\u2019s a spookiness,\u201d said Marcelo Burlon of his Fall collection this evening. The resultant clothes had the sort of remiss appeal of a rave that might take place in such an inoperable venue\u2014they were consciously grungy-glossy, with hits of neon, sequins, and consciously \u201cwrong\u201d acid-hue animal prints. This lineup also felt more rounded-out than seasons past; for Spring, we noted that Burlon had depressurized his aesthetic. This inclination continues to serve him well. In the theme park after-hours dawn, carnival stripes banded to form a faux fur jacket; another long coat had the words \u201cunlimited rides\u201d on the back. Sparkly separates, leopard-print-inset anoraks, denim\u2014particularly painted-over black pieces that were distressed away to reveal abrasions of fluorescence\u2014and even a few tailored jackets further set the scene. Burlon mentioned that he\u2019s just opened his sixth store; so far, they\u2019re all in Asia, but his hope is for global freestanding outposts.

Just. Make. Clothes. Of course, it\u2019s not easy, at all, especially given the mercurial relationship that so many of us now have with what we want to wear and what we want to buy. Correct me if I am wrong here\u2014and I\u2019m truly happy to be proved otherwise\u2014but has fashion ever been more tricky to navigate? It\u2019s everything about it. The looks that seem to last a nanosecond, hooking us on to the new new thing. The proliferation of (there is no other word) product. And, the increasing (and rightful) rising awareness of the environmental impact of our mad need for more, more, and yet more. No one could ever accuse Margaret Howell of not making clothes, but there\u2019s no \u201cjust\u201d about them. They come layered\u2014literally and metaphorically\u2014with so many associations and triggers: Englishness, craft, respect, utility, consideration, tradition, purpose, and a tangible sense of a future. The latter might surprise some who see Howell as a wonderful purveyor of nostalgia, a designer of misty-eyed remembrances of the past. Not so. Her coed show for Fall 2019, held yet again in the Rambert dance space on London\u2019s South Bank, demonstrated how you can take everything you do and stand for, yet still be clear-sighted about what\u2019s needed now\u2014and next. Once again, this was a terrific showing of clothes; clothes that looked like they\u2019d stick around, clothes that weren\u2019t hung up on gender distinctions, clothes that felt like they could be personalized to a point that they\u2019d really feel like yours. An interesting side note to this: Howell has always been a lover of the carefully considered styling flourish, but this season it often felt like the models had actually just put on what they were wearing themselves and figured out how they\u2019d actually want to wear them: the casual rolling of the ankles of ecru cotton drill pants; the cinching of trouser waistbands with sturdy belts; silken scarves trailing from back pockets, a deliciously fey touch in contrast with the slouchier, oversize, and casual feel of the pieces they were worn with. Those proportions are key, particularly to the great outerwear that was on show: functional/utilitarian coats with breast pockets in black or army green; blazers in brown corduroy or earthy check tweeds, cut with a slope to the shoulders, irrespective of gender; and, the standout, black waxed-cotton anoraks and bomber jackets. These were variously worn with white or salmon pink cotton shirting, ivory sweaters and olive cardigans, and pleated skirts in a graphic 2-D leaf print. Clothes, in other words. And truly effortless, real, and desirable clothes, at that."}, {"Designer": "Marni", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Backstage before today\u2019s show, Marni\u2019s Francesco Risso could\u2019ve easily been mistaken for one of the models patiently waiting to step into the black boom box built inside an industrial space as the set. Risso sported what looked like a spongy hybrid coat/bathrobe in a black-and-white, vaguely nondescript diamond pattern, worn loose, unbelted and trailing, topped with a wool matching-not-matching beret with a dangling pom-pom at the end. He looked like the crazily stylish fashion template around which he has built the new Marni aesthetic. Risso has an oracular, almost esoteric way of explaining his collections\u2019 meaning. His narrative definitely doesn\u2019t lack charm. \u201cI wanted to address the elephant in the room,\u201d he said. \u201cThe puppeteers out there who are busy playing soccer with our planet, hanging their coats on elephants\u2019 tusks\u2014they don\u2019t realize that these neuro-tribe movements are emerging from the streets and they\u2019re invading the space: This for me is the sense of this collection. They are atypical kids, extravagant and not diagnosable types. You have to imagine an invasion, like in a 3-D Risk game.\u201d Inside the black boom box, while a rather disquieting remix of Claude Debussy\u2019s \u201cPr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l\u2019Apr\u00e8s-Midi d\u2019un Faune\u201d was booming, the aforementioned neuro-tribes made their appearance, stomping their banana-sock boots, wearing what looked like a gentle parody of conservative suiting. There were ginormous blazers and matching trailing pants in wool boucl\u00e9 or moleskin in dark classic colors, \u201cimposing like if they were dressed with moveable apartments,\u201d mused Risso. The conservative, slightly David Byrne\u2013esque, magnified suits slowly unraveled, morphing into grand-scale, full-on pyrotechnics. It was a riotous, sensually crazy, Dionysian psychedelic extravaganza of knitted jumpers or layered pajamas printed in acid-bright patterns. These were inspired by Allegro Non Troppo, a \u201970s animated movie by the Italian director Bruno Bozzetto, which was a parody of Walt Disney\u2019s Fantasia. \u201cThey\u2019re disheveled, disassembled, they are Les Enfants Terribles du Paradis,\u201d enthused the designer. Like a pagan ritual reaching its climax, when delirium unfolds into a sort of quiet stupor, the show\u2019s rhythm regressed into a more muffled atmosphere; l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi of the young fauns approached the twilight zone. Volumes, proportions, and colors reverted to slimmer, neat incarnations, almost bromidic in their graceful, sensual blandness. Bromidic \u00e0 la Marni, of course; you could feel that the neuro-tribe\u2019s ferocious energy was ready to bite back."}, {"Designer": "Martin Grant", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Martin Grant has lived in Paris long enough to have mastered the essence of French style: \u201cIt\u2019s a cool mix of effortless simplicity and refinement,\u201d he said. Grant could describe his own line the same way; his loyal cohort of customers, including plenty of French actresses, would surely agree. They appreciate the timeless quality of his designs, tweaked every season with slight updates in cut and proportion. Lee Radziwill, whose best-dressed-list credentials are impeccable, has been wearing Grant\u2019s coats and dresses for decades. Pre-Fall revolved around pieces of easy sophistication; the beautifully cut outerwear included reversible wrap coats in dry Prince of Wales wool, round-shaped three-quarter-length balmacaans in navy or black cashmere, and straight-line peacoats in a charming shade of Titian red. The color palette was charming throughout\u2014warm rust tones contrasted with an intense hue of forest green, accented by touches of soft pink and deep black. Tailoring was also one of the collection\u2019s strong points. Pantsuits were cut sharp, either with abbreviated blazers nipped at the waist or with masculine-inspired elongated double-breasted jackets, worn with smart high-waisted wide-leg pants. Grant\u2019s dresses are quintessentially feminine, without indulging frills, embellishments, or overt sensuality. Their purity of line has a certain aristocratic hauteur. Case in point were two standout numbers in emerald green silk, one with a plunging V-neckline and a trapeze skirt, the other a sinuous midi dress with billowing sleeves, cinched at the waist with a silver leather belt. They had sophistication and modernity in spades. Grant has been presenting a well-edited men\u2019s collection for three seasons now; it had the same refined style and streamlined design as his women\u2019s line. He used fabrics that allowed for the shapes, volumes, and the neat contours he favors: checkered wools, double cashmeres, thick wool felts. Suits and city coats were cut with precision but without any stiffness."}, {"Designer": "Martine Rose", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Odds-on, this is possibly the most exciting lookbook fashion men and boys will see this season. Martine Rose\u2014when she speaks, whenever she shows, whenever she doesn\u2019t\u2014there are people all over the place who hang on her every move. The show she staged on a street in north London last summer is now legend in that neighborhood and amongst those who attended from around the globe. \u201cI talked to everyone beforehand, but I didn\u2019t really know how it would go. Then, people started coming out of their houses and setting up chairs in their front gardens with a couple of beers and the odd Pimm\u2019s to watch,\u201d she remembers. \u201cBut when the children came out and ran along the street before it started, I knew it was going to be good.\u201d But there was no Martine Rose on London\u2019s men\u2019s Fashion Week schedule this time, and people were wondering where she\u2019d gone. Especially tortured were her youngest followers. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s nothing like the number that Virgil [Abloh] has . . . but I do have people who I can\u2019t believe the level they will go to to get things or find out snippets of information. It\u2019s so sweet, and deeply flattering. And they\u2019re really young, students and teenagers. They\u2019re just really geeky about clothes.\u201d Now, they can be put out of their misery, for Rose is here with her clothes in a showroom in Paris\u2014only showing when she feels like it suits her. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on designers and brands to outdo themselves every season, so to actually not do something, and being quiet felt like the most radical thing I can do. I really love clothes; I\u2019m so interested in how people wear them, and their cultural meaning. That\u2019s why I decided to really reduce it, be really simple and plain, and concentrate on the clothes, on a top and a bottom.\u201d She makes it sound like nothing\u2014Martine Rose is ridiculously self-effacing\u2014but as cognoscenti will immediately notice, she has performed one of her sick things with proportions and sexuality that is guaranteed to get people staring. It involves being fearless and self-interrogating, this talent for shifting things. She stood by the first look on her rail\u2014a cropped denim jacket with dropped shoulders and the genius touch of press studs outlining the pocket flaps and shoulder seams. \u201cI like it when you look at something, and you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s horrible or it\u2019s actually great. Is it good taste or bad taste?\u201d she laughed. \u201cMe, I don\u2019t even want to be someone with \u2018good taste.\u2019\u201d Well, praise be that she doesn\u2019t bother herself with what\u2019s now and acceptable because otherwise, it\u2019s likely that the concept of \u201coversize\u201d jackets in fashion\u2014for women as well as men\u2014wouldn\u2019t have happened. She picked up a tan leather overshirt-jacket. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny. When I first did this shape back in Spring 2013, people were like, \u2018Ugh, what is that?\u2019 Now, it looks completely normal.\u201d The link in this chain is Demna Gvasalia, who was a fan of Martine Rose before he was anyone, and he brought Rose into Balenciaga to consult on the menswear collection. \u201cI\u2019ve just finished my last season there,\u201d she said. (Industry note: A gold-dust originator is free!) But as to pushing daringly forward this season, Rose has cut narrow-leg, super-high-waisted trousers, and created a kind of (for want of a more adequately hip term) toreador silhouette with a striped T-shirt bloused into it. She\u2019s also done a pair of flares based on what the style-oblivious U.K. hero and former soccer manager of Arsenal Ars\u00e8ne Wenger used to wear that fashion eyes would have cringed away from until now. Because, after the drop-crotch tracksuit bottom years, new things are shaping up in the men\u2019s trouser department. Rose\u2019s can get a lot more sexy than that. One pair has a fly zipper that goes continuously \u201call around.\u201d She\u2019s also turned regular football shirts into \u201cclubwear\u201d by cutting out the shoulders and collaborated with a collector of \u201950s to \u201970s memorabilia from gay San Francisco culture in finding and using defunct logos from condom brands of the time. A local London manufacturing supporter she\u2019s worked with is the organic denim-makers Blackhorse Lane. \u201cBecause they have a lot of waste, and I\u2019ve taken it and reused it to patchwork together limited runs of shirts and jeans.\u201d The most personal parts in the collection, however, are prints based on \u201chonoring the Jamaican family I come from. My grandparents are from the Windrush generation.\u201d The Windrush was a ship that transported thousands of hopeful people from the Caribbean to England in the 1950s on the British government\u2019s promise that they were needed to fill jobs and help put the country back on its feet post-WWII. An unfolding state scandal has only recently emerged: that many of the children who traveled (legitimately) under their parents\u2019 passports, who are now in middle and old age and have lived in Britain for roughly 60 years, have recently been rounded up and sent \u201chome.\u201d Theresa May, while she was home secretary, was particularly zealous in ramping up the deportations. \u201cThe stories are harrowing, of people being taken away after a knock on the door at 2 a.m. without even being told why.\u201d Rose has made three prints, one a recipe for ackee and saltfish, on a tea towel, which, she said, \u201cReminds me of a Jamaican home.\u201d Does it help that she can use the platform of fashion? \u201cI can\u2019t do anything to change things,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can use it to talk about it.\u201d Again, she is quietly underestimating herself. A lot of people are paying attention to Martine Rose.

She made him a star.\u201d The Halston documentary was picked up at Sundance last month and will have its theatrical release later this year. And HBO is making a third season of The Deuce. Michael Kors isn\u2019t about to let this party pass him by. And why should he? He lived it. At a preview, he remembered tumbling out of Studio 54 way past dawn, grabbing breakfast at a diner, and heading straight to his job at boutique Lothar\u2019s, where he washed the nightclub\u2019s fake snow out of his hair in the bathroom sink. \u201cNew York was a pit, but we were dressed,\u201d he said. \u201cOptimism in the face of adversity, it\u2019s the only way you can win.\u201d He isn\u2019t the only designer who\u2019s following the good times for Fall; the feathers and fake fur have really been flying at the New York shows. Kors had both, in the form of colorful boas and an intarsia chevron coat. The collection was informed by his West 50s stomping grounds, with Studio 54 playing the lead role. Kors secured the rights to the logo, and he made plentiful use of it, embroidering it on a sequin T-shirt dress, splashing it across a full-length puffer, and printing silk blouses for both guys and girls, worn unbuttoned to the navel in both cases. Andrea True was on the soundtrack singing \u201cMore, More, More\u201d\u2014of course she was. Kors knows all the oldies, and he isn\u2019t one to shy away from camp. But there were also subtle cashmere knits in the mix\u2014minimalist nods to Lincoln Center\u2019s ballerinas that balanced the maximalism elsewhere. And he brought the lithe athleticism of those knits to dresses in sequined matte jersey. Dance-floor ready whatever the decade. To finish, a black curtain pulled back to reveal a wall of gold tinsel and Barry Manilow. The crooner performed \u201cCopacabana,\u201d after which Kors came out for his bow with another legend of the era, model Patti Hansen, who closed the show in a metallic trouser suit.

Installed in the center of the pristine white space were sculptures by the Swedish-Chilean artist Anton Alvarez. Part of a series called \u201cAerobic Alphabet,\u201d the boldly colored organic formations were made using the Extruder, an imposing self-constructed three-ton machine that basically works like a big toothpaste tube, squeezing out ceramic paste in various tubular shapes. \u201cI\u2019ve been collecting his work for several years,\u201d said Angela Missoni. \u201cIt\u2019s textural, yet abstract; he also wraps architectural elements with colorful threads or yarns.\u201d The sensual, tactile aspect of Alvarez\u2019s work resonates with the Missoni aesthetic and, indeed, it infused this men\u2019s collection, which was designed with artsy types in mind. \u201cI was thinking more of a gallery owner than of an actual artist,\u201d said Missoni. \u201cThe style here is more soign\u00e9, a little more subtle, less eccentric.\u201d There\u2019s a new formality in the air this menswear season. The designer captured and Missoni-fied it via gently eccentric twists, most notably in the elongated silhouettes of knitted soft-tailored suits, whose beautiful tonal d\u00e9grad\u00e9s echo Alvarez\u2019s vibrant color palette. The collaboration with the artist proved fruitful, also inspiring the design of a few gorgeous jumpers: Abstract patterns were knitted on flecked mohair, while undulating motifs were hand-embroidered on an oversize turtleneck sweater. Worn with high-waisted, tapered, loom-knitted pants, they looked cool enough to appeal to fastidious artsy types. Yet discriminating as they may be, they won\u2019t be able to resist the glamour of \u201970s-inspired tuxedos in woven lam\u00e9, worn with debonair pliss\u00e9 string scarves.

There were 11 different collections presented side by side in various formats in a series of railway arches under the lines north of Milan\u2019s central station. Most of the city had been invited to roll up at 8:00 p.m., but we nipped in 40 minutes early while the coast was relatively clear and tried to get the job done. That entailed sometimes interviewing designers without seeing the looks as they were still backstage, or sometimes seeing looks without interviewing designers. It was, as they say here, a casino\u2014but a fun one. Looking at the pictures that will go above this review, you\u2019ll probably have a better view of some of the collections than this reviewer. However, below is what was gleaned from the launch, in order of the collections\u2019 numeric categorization. 0 Moncler Richard Quinn\nThe sad truth is I never got to see this collection. But I did see its setting, a tunnel whose roof was clad in wild print with a runway flanked by black blooms. Happily, I also saw Quinn, lolling with two members of his team outside, and frantically pumped him for info. His response was: \u201cIt\u2019s about taking the shapes we usually do but putting them in a down-jacket context. Also using the fastenings that we used in the collection we showed in London yesterday. We have nice high puffer boots and puffer bags that are synonymous with Moncler. It\u2019s really a mash-up of the two worlds.\u201d 1 Moncler Pierpaolo Piccioli\nThis collection saw Valentino\u2019s often smoking and always interesting creative director apply a collaboration to a collaboration. He approached his friend Liya Kebede to input the patterns and aesthetic of her sustainable and socially responsible Ethiopian label Lemlem to his couture interpretation of Moncler. When we found PPP he was in his tunnel shooting his mise-en-sc\u00e8ne on his iPhone, surrounded by the usual phalanx of international PR reps. The looks had the same voluptuous volume of his first presentation for Genius, but here they were interrupted by the graphic vibrancy of Lemlem\u2019s contribution. So how has Moncler + PPP + Lemlem turned into his latest expression of Genius? He said: \u201cI don't think that you can really do anything new today. But you can create new harmonies\u2014new points of view and perspectives. Actually, I did this little collection while I was doing couture, while I was doing other things. And of course what I wanted to do is, through my own identity, interpret the worlds of Moncler. I felt I wanted to add the feeling of another perspective\u2014specifically the Liya perspective. I think that inclusivity is not a just word; I really believe in the idea of working together in a way that gives you new points of view . . . and I was thinking that when couture was born it was not meant to be for black women. It was just for white women. Magazines like Jet were not even allowed to borrow clothes! So this collection is to show that the dream of couture should be allowed for everybody, and that\u2019s why the idea of Liya worked so well.\u201d Kebede\u2019s virtuous circle of a label, Lemlem, is produced by artisan seamstresses in her native Ethiopia, who apply traditional patterns to contemporarily pitched European-style clothes. Piccioli said: \u201cI love the idea of celebrating craft and giving these women the opportunity to work. I wanted to re-create the Lemlem fabrics in nylon. I think that if you talk about something like this\u2014a new perspective\u2014it is very good.\u201d 2 Moncler 1952 (Donna)\nVeronica Leoni is one of the apparently endless supply of Phoebe Philo studio prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who have broken cover since the great Celine schism of 2018. I can\u2019t tell you she is the next Philo, but I can tell you she knows how to show a collection. Leoni\u2019s space was a large box filled with feathers in which her models stood looking out. The box was apparently made of reverse-reflection glass, so while the audience could see the models, they could not see us. About 30 seconds after we entered the room, it was plunged into darkness, interrupted only by strobes and Kate Bush (I think) at top volume on the PA system. So the clothes were essentially invisible but the designer was not, and she said: \u201cWe would consider this box a gathering of the greatest women we can find, in there to feel empowered by themselves but also exposed to us. We are kind of spying on them. And yeah, I think it is a fine line in between fashion and what needs to be after fashion. The dream of what you want to share.\u201d At this point I pleaded with Leoni\u2014we were standing in pitch blackness and her clothes were invisible. She laughed. \u201cYeah, but you are going to buy them! You will get the chance to see them!\u201d I had glimpsed some patches on a down jacket. \u201cThey were a collaboration with Itchy Scratchy Patchy\u2014made by Edie Campbell and Christabel MacGreevy. We tried to bring a little bit of that do-it-yourself vibe. And we decided to do a recognition of all of the female heroes in history, so there is Salome there is Sappho . . . there\u2019s a little bit of a \u201990s London clubbing atmosphere.\u201d In the strobe-punctuated darkness, it all made sense. 2 Moncler 1952 (Uomo)\nSergio Zambon\u2019s was, along with the Grenoble collection and Fragment, my favorite tunnel of the night in terms of being full of clothes I wanted to hustle the Moncler PR department into giving me. Zambon said: \u201cThis season it is about a very laid-back guy who loves nature but lives in a very big city. Specifically it is a guy from L.A., where the nature is very close. There is a slightly hippie mood in the collection. So there is a fringing on a down jacket and a down jacket in a cotton tie-dye.\u201d The looks were presented in surface-less survival domes and were pretty great. There was also a side note in Zambon\u2019s collaboration with Valextra, which was made up of oversize totes in super-luxe leather with piumino straps and customizable letter identification. 3 Moncler Grenoble\nThis was awesome. I like to ski, and I love Moncler\u2014whose roots are in ski and mountaineering\u2014to wear on the slopes. But today more than ever before, Sandro Mandrino elevated his skiwear to a conceptual level that sat above even the atmospheric by injecting the spirit of 1969 into this collection for 2019. \u201cThe idea was to translate the concept of old festivals in a modern way\u2014like a rave, but in the snow. We translate what is in our culture.\u201d Mandrino\u2019s tunnel was filled with lots of multi-colored tufted podiums and good music. Fringed summer-of-love-style touches were applied to hyper-technical GPS-enabled skiwear. The models in this tunnel were totally happy\u2014they\u2019d drawn the long straw. A great collection, and coolest room of the night. 4 Moncler Simone Rocha\nThe lovely and brilliant Simone Rocha was the first designer I bumped into this evening. She was gathering with the others for a group photograph but spared a moment to chat about a collection I had yet to see. She said: \u201cThis collection I was thinking more about nature. The set is outdoors\u2014they are in a forest of silver birch trees\u2014and I was thinking about Girl Guides protecting themselves against nature . . . the idea of camping and tents almost becomes their protection. And that is molded into voluminous puffer capes that are tied on . . . key pieces are definitely the tent capes which I have done in a blush with red. And I\u2019ve done some very special pearly headpieces, which I think are very Moncler.\u201d 5 Moncler Craig Green\nCraig Green ended up showing me pictures of his collection on a phone as the installation had yet to open\u2014and gave this commentary on what he showed. \u201cSo every season we draw on something that we think is at the core of Moncler\u2019s DNA. This collection was about lightness. All of the garments can pack into really small squares. As we were going through the design process, all of the choices we made\u2014in the zips, the poppers, everything\u2014were defined considering lightness as a prime factor. Including fabrics. I know everyone has done packable to death, but here we\u2019ve done it in a new way: There is a series of zips that pull the air out of the down as it is being closed. We've developed a new structure in making down panels. There is a 2.5-cm gap in between every single pillow, which acts as a hinge so you can fold it. And then the series of zips squeezes it and the whole folds into a flat square.\u201d Oh, Craig\u2014you chisel-chinned technical virtuoso\u2014you are almost OCD in your applied technicality. But the result is garments unlike those produced by any other designer. 6 Moncler 1017 Alyx 9SM\nMatthew Williams was still limping from his now legendary soccer injury when I met him in his installation. It consisted of models on a series of raised platforms as well as floor level. There were plenty of recognizable details from Williams\u2019s own line named after his daughter, Alyx. His key rollercoaster-belt fastening had been adapted into a chain belt worn above puffers and fastened by a carabiner. Those puffers were garment-dyed\u2014a key Alyx signature that had never been explored at Moncler before. He added: \u201cI just wanted it to be a real blend of some of the iconic parts of Alyx and of Moncler meshed together. And then we also have these seamless knits which are base layer garments\u2014tights and tops\u2014made from Econyl, recycled fishing line, which is really cool. Also a first, which is really nice. These vulcanized waterproof boots, made in a mold, are also new. We do a lot with leather at Alyx, so it was good to merge that into the bonded-leather jacket. And in some garments there is a material we developed for this project which is made of coated down feathers\u2014we took the most iconic thing for Moncler, the feather, which is something that is usually unseen\u2014and made it seen by coating it.\u201d At this point we went up some stairs at my demand to look further at said fabric\u2014which, to be frank, simply looked like a normal technical fabric, but which I totally believe was once made of feathers. At the top of the stairs I remembered Williams\u2019s leg is currently broken, and felt awful. 7 Moncler Fragment Hiroshi Fujiwara\nHiroshi Fujiwara obligingly emerged from his railway arch, in which a crowd of handsome young fellows was mingling on a floor of distorted check to a cacophonous soundtrack, to chat. The clothes in his third Genius collection looked heavily tinged by highly researched Americana\u2014technical Ivy League, and demob military surplus. This is what Fujiwara was kind enough to share: \u201cI am slowly getting used to how we can progress this mix between Moncler\u2019s and my kind of things. This time I think we\u2019ve made an even better combination. Moncler has great craftsmanship and technology for the winter clothes. So I\u2019m putting kind of my favorite things\u2014like vintage and military\u2014and combining them with this new technology.\u201d This idea of combining the emotional significance laden in the codes of vintage, as polished and nurtured by Fujiwara, with the technical metier of Moncler resulted in a collection that looked particularly strong. 8 Moncler Palm Angels | Art Breaking\nIn the event, Francesco Ragazzi\u2019s Palm Angels was the only Genius installation of the bunch we failed to inspect. There was just too much Genius to take in. Catching up with him a couple of days later, Ragazzi brought us up to speed: \u201cThe concept of the installation was that of a vandalized art gallery. It started with this image of a Jeff Koons show being vandalized by protestors, and then I collaborated with Willi Dorner, an artist out of Vienna who works in urban spaces, and we worked on this series of images. Then at the event, we had a lineup of outfits, and the idea was the audience could press this button and spray them with paint\u2014it was really fun.\u201d For the collection, Ragazzi said he took still more inspiration from Koons, incorporating his queasy metallic shades and playing fast and loose with conventional norms of volume. Over this were layered details that implied a subsequent and irreverent imprimatur: \u201cThere was graffiti, and the Moncler was distorted and twisted in volume and mashed up into collages. It was touched by punk and had this protest aspect\u2014mixing the purity of Moncler with something aggressive and darker.\u201d Moncler & Poldo Dog Couture\nThis was the big one, the one I\u2019d been especially keen to see: dog couture. A standalone article about it will follow, since many of the models were not on site, and this review is already as long on words as Moncler\u2019s Genius is full of ideas."}, {"Designer": "Moschino", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Jeremy Scott\u2019s men\u2019s Fall and women\u2019s Pre-Fall collections for Moschino\u2014strutted out this evening on a set at Rome\u2019s Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios\u2014were high camp and just as clever. \u201cIt\u2019s Fellini,\u201d said the designer backstage, regarding the late Italian filmmaker. \u201cIt\u2019s all the things I love about him, come to light . . . . There are exaggerations, off-duty showgirls, Casanovas. It\u2019s surreal, it\u2019s otherworldly.\u201d Scott has long been committed to pomp. But analyze his work a bit further, and it\u2019s the circumstance that really rings. His Fellini-inspired Roman parade felt, somehow, apropos of the greater moment\u2014of a world where fools hold power, and hyperbole and excess are the new normal. Scott called out characters from Satyricon, La Dolce Vita (which was filmed at Cinecitt\u00e0), Roma (1972), and more. They came to life as women in herringbone tweed topcoats with starkly contrasting satin bows, tailored coatdresses with ancient font embroideries, flou in force, and chandelier earrings the size of actual chandeliers. For men, eccentricity was also front and center: trompe l\u2019oeil sequined officer coats, a finely beaded lattice embroidery on a suit under a technical parka, and a spin on white-tie dressing\u2014replete with a leather jacket and a tutu\u2014all included. Pointing to a rose-red evening dress, Scott said, \u201cThat\u2019s my baby Anita Ekberg\u201d (Ekberg was the actress who famously waded into Rome\u2019s Trevi Fountain in La Dolce Vita). These nouveau Fellini sketches were embodied by everyone from Teddy Quinlivan to Denek Kania to Jon Kortajarena to Nadja Auermann. Not all of the fashion tonight was fresh-out-of-the-box original. But, when it comes to the intersection of style and pop cultures\u2014be they fueled by the social media apps of now or the silver screens of Fellini\u2019s era\u2014few have as sound and confident a grasp in this business as Scott does. This show, with its high-piled wigs, little prince crowns, juxtaposed tones, and almost consciously falsified opulence further proved it through a chaotic, flighty sense of control. What he does is arch, but it\u2019s both cinematically engaging and slyly smart (slash low-key biting). It does get you thinking . . . . What would Jeremy make if he went behind the camera?"}, {"Designer": "MSGM", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "A glossy, superfast race car isn\u2019t the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of MSGM; what Massimo Giorgetti extracted as inspiration from the competitive world of Formula One superstar pilots wasn\u2019t the aggressive glamour of their lifestyle, but rather the concept of speed. Just to make the message clear, the show\u2019s invitation was a Niki Lauda\u2013style sporty cap emblazoned with the word turbo, reinforced by the slogan \u201cIf everything is under control, it means that you\u2019re not going fast enough.\u201d Was it an ode to the breakneck speed at which today\u2019s world is crazily spinning? \u201cNot really,\u201d said Giorgetti. \u201cI intended it more as a provocation. The world is definitely going way too fast.\u201d To bring home his point, he quoted the lyrics of Italian progressive post-punk bands Confusional Quartet and Kina, which provided the show\u2019s soundtrack and were quite telling of the designer\u2019s mindset: \u201cThese years are running/ Like crazy cars/ You hear them coming/ You turn and they\u2019re gone.\u201d The years are surely running fast, and MSGM seems to be expanding at a quick pace, as reflected by the collection\u2019s confident, bolder attitude. The sporty racing theme was in evidence in the eco-leather side-striped pants, and the allover flame prints in fire-engine red on no-nonsense poplin shirts and matching straight pants. Oversize knitted jumpers were emblazoned with slogans like \u201cMore Speed\u201d or \u201cRun Away,\u201d highlighting an ambivalent attitude towards the idea of velocity. Running, but where and in which direction? One target the label is moving towards is a more elevated attitude, which was perceivable in today\u2019s lineup. Sporty pieces in eco-leather, such as bright-colored parkas and trucker jackets embossed with Milan\u2019s Duomo skyline, had an upscale, almost luxe feel. Yet for street-native labels the elephant in the room today is tailoring being back in favor, including for younger customers. Giorgetti is a designer with his finger on the pulse, so he was quick to address this trend, offering a series of well cut boxy city coats and suits in classic tones of gray and beige. Worn under humongous padded eco-leather bombers or huge zebra-printed fleece sweats, they looked like if they were running in the right direction."}, {"Designer": "MYAR", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Christopher Raeburn, Greg Lauren, Joe Casely-Hayford, and many other designers have worked to rework army surplus. But there can never be a surfeit of talented surplus reworkers, because giving deadstock originally dedicated to combat a new incarnation designed to be enjoyed is a deeply worthy exercise. Andrea Rosso is doing it very well at MYAR. A U.S.-issue jacket in Gulf War\u2013era desert-night camo\u2014a gridded green-on-green, designed originally to obscure the wearer from night-vision equipment\u2014was enhanced with reflective tabs. Marines sweats featuring the ballsy insignia of eagle and anchor overseeing the world, with the U.S. in the foreground, were reflected in an added MYAR insignia of an Italian-facing globe and the lion of Venice. Really very lovely was an already handsome Swiss Army shirt whose camouflage was overprinted with periwinkle daubs; a patch of the unaltered fabric placed between the shoulder blades displayed the original. Linings were customized with additional pockets and zippers to transform them into bombers. An olive-drab boilersuit was recut into dungarees. Field jackets\u2014some olive, some camo\u2014were spliced into half-and-halfs; Swedish scout shirts received a similar treatment. A Battaglione San Marco jacket originally produced in the \u201980s featured a handsome exposed yoke. An especially nice touch is that each piece comes with a little tie-top bag in which all the off-cuts removed from the original garment during Rosso\u2019s reworking are included, along with a mark of provenance. Sometimes, the designer added, he is reminded much more directly of the history of the garments he is working to give new life to: \u201cOne time in Bologna, this older guy came up to me and said, \u2018I did my service wearing that jacket!\u2019 This is nice, this connection, and it is nice to give these clothes another incarnation.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Neil Barrett", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Ideas of masculinity, queerness, power, and sensuality are at the heart of what designer Neil Grotzinger does with his eponymous brand, Nihl. In the two seasons he\u2019s shown since graduating from the Parsons MFA program, he has established his look as delicate yet thoroughly enticing, coming apart at the beaded seams or cinched with sensual hook-and-eye closures. It\u2019s a mesmerizing aesthetic, only amplified by the fact that for all the copying and referencing and Insta-appeal of contemporary fashion, Nihl does not look like anything else. That\u2019s to the credit of the young designer, who has plumbed his own life story for subversions of classic military and American tropes. This season he\u2019s added the idea of a video gamer, bringing takes on compression tops\u2014including one with a giant O cut out on the chest\u2014and cargo shorts into the mix. There are moments of poetry, like spray-painted lace pants, and others that have an aggressive air, like full-body leather numbers. Somewhere in between are Nihl\u2019s new commercial-facing pieces: the lowest of low-rise trousers and shrunken tees with logo patches and photo prints. Clever, to mix the artistry of his early work with a more viable business model. Then, you learn that the images of suburban houses and stoic, sullen-cheeked men on the tees are pulled from queer porn.

Not only is the style of photography similar, but back are the fringe and the tracksuits the designer has been showing for decades; also returning are slim-fit suits and black-and-white prints. So more of the same? Yes and no. As a businesswoman, Kamali has to think globally and consider how she can appeal \u201cto everyone in the world who has access to me, and who I have access to\u201d while taking into consideration different climates, attitudes toward gender, religious behaviors, lifestyles, et cetera. It\u2019s a big remit, but Kamali is confident that it\u2019s possible to complete this puzzle without flattening or watering down her work. \u201cThe way you stay authentic,\u201d she says, \u201cis to evolve and grow and be relevant.\u201d Having a well-defined design vocabulary is a boon to her brand equity; still, it would be refreshing to see some new silhouettes from Kamali. The Fall collection does deliver newness and relevance in this collection. It\u2019s there in the transparent pieces, for example. When worn over a black leotard, as seen in Look 10, a see-through slip dress evokes a Helmut Newton power woman. Peek-a-boo track separates, meant for layering, in contrast, are unexpected and playful. Kamali is a pragmatic designer in some ways (her clothes can travel, be thrown in the wash), but she also possesses a special radar that\u2019s tuned into the now\u2014and the next. Currently she\u2019s deep into learning about VR and AI, and she\u2019s looking into ways they can be applied to fashion. Her great experience gives her perspective, too, allowing her to place current needs and trends within a larger matrix. Her use of khakis and olive drabs and her focus on gender neutrality are right for now, but they also relate to what came before, specifically the 1970s. \u201cWe keep talking about the 1970s,\u201d Kamali says, \u201cbut there\u2019s a reason: [It was the time of the] Vietnam War. There was meditation and peace and love, and then there were protests, fires, police . . . . That energy is back again.\u201d It\u2019s a contradictory force that has some running for shelter in the designer\u2019s famous sleeping bag coats, offered in camo for Fall. This motif, which is apparently a huge draw at retail, appeals to a \u201csubliminal sense of protection,\u201d says Kamali. The designer, who has dressed the New York Dolls, hasn\u2019t ignored exhibitionists though.

Luke Meier was living in Seattle during the early \u201890s; the music, the aesthetic, and the scene turned into firsthand memories. Some of this found its way into his latest OAMC collection, but he took great care to avoid the obvious and advance it forward. \u201cGrunge doesn\u2019t have to look old and like it\u2019s falling apart; it\u2019s the attitude,\u201d he said backstage. \u201cMaybe even subconsciously, I wanted to make it newer, cleaner.\u201d He did so by realizing a collection that appeared expressive yet balanced\u2014and unique from look to look. Utility, always a form-meets-function pillar of OAMC, felt different once again this season; Meier\u2019s word for it was purity. Suit-type statements were assembled as staggered layers; flannel shirts were elongated and worn over matching second-skin sleeves; and technical coats in matte quilting or double-face check were elegantly finished from all angles. Further on in the lineup came oversize graphic intarsia sweaters and twisted textile necklaces that were more ornamental, yet evidenced Meier\u2019s discerning eye. Indeed, a quick glance at the sneakers in pale surgical green and pink, developed with Adidas Originals, were the perfect antidote to all the steroid styles that remain popular. On the subject of color, the collection\u2019s pastel accords\u2014pleasantly nonconformist in the midst of the lights and darks\u2014and the use of latex were manifestations of another reference, Matthew Barney\u2019s Cremaster Cycle, which Meier experienced while living in New York in the late \u201890s. \u201cI was pretty lucky to be in these places at these times,\u201d he quipped backstage. Ultimately, the collection emerged as highly personal; these were cultural moments that had left an indelible mark. As for the selection of sketches contributed by Daniel Johnston, Meier spoke of the outsider musician and artist in the highest terms. \u201cWhat he does is real and honest and pure.\u201d Accordingly, OAMC has committed to working with Johnston\u2019s charity organization dedicated to mental health issues, simply named, Hi, How Are You."}, {"Designer": "Off-White", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "People seated around today\u2019s Off-White runway may not have realized that the sharp green staging allowed landscape images to be superimposed on the background of the livestream, almost like a high-concept weather report. In calling this show \u201cPublic Television,\u201d Virgil Abloh said he was making the point that, at least for those of us who grew up watching TV, the barrage of ads and images were actually forming our environment and shaping our view of the world. Conceivably, the same remains true whether our screens are handheld or wall-sized. But instead of dwelling on the deleterious effects, Abloh\u2014whose chill-factor is off the charts\u2014channeled this subliminal influence with his own heavily branded programming. This made for a pretty good show, partly because, like all good TV, it was entertaining. From the opening sample of Mr. Roger\u2019s Neighborhood to the rhymes of Ghostface Killah, the music calibrated eerie with intimidating. Though mostly meaningless, the use of football helmets\u2014especially on two girls in floral catsuits\u2014made for catchy social media posting. And then there was Offset from the rap group Migos, who shuffled down an earthy path in a full-length, lilac-hued puffer coat like a winterized guru. None of this distracted from a collection that largely reaffirmed the standard Off-White repertoire rather than aiming for reinvention. Looks that paired boxy, deconstructed blazers with pooling denim, or else minimalist jackets with graphic streetwear once again toggled between Abloh\u2019s youth and executive archetypes. A fleece pullover countered with a fur-collared coat; ties appeared under shirt hoodies. \u201cYou get better through repetition, more focused,\u201d Abloh said. \u201cI\u2019m finding my voice, which is what happens when you repeat.\u201d Maybe this voice will always bear traces of others (he openly credited JNCO jeans for the baggy pants, while his co-opted shipping logo looked flagrantly familiar). Yet there were details that could win over devotee and doubter alike. The belt bags fused to the fronts of quilted jackets and vests were clever; the embroidered tagging, TV bar motifs, and spray-painted faded knees on pants, creative. And what to make of the large labels sewn onto sleeves\u2014the kind that guys occasionally, embarrassingly, neglect to remove?

Six years ago, I was working from my kitchen.\u201d It might be tempting to describe his clothes as straightforward, too. Relaxed, winter-weight pleated pants for men; an everyday suit for women; basic knits and shearling bomber jackets for everyone\u2014not a single piece in the show would be complicated to wear. Get him started on the details, however, and you sense the effort involved in bringing these complementary collections to life. Take his update on the three-button jacket; Mah\u00e9o determined that the cut should be closer to a workwear style than one that is classically tailored. Accordingly, the fit through the body runs straight while the sleeves and shoulders appear slightly rounder. With the women\u2019s jackets, small shoulder pads were added for the first time but the result remained lean. Double-breasted jackets were designed so they looked just as smart worn open. Mah\u00e9o continues to reveal a fair amount about both his process and his mindset in the written statements that accompany each show. This season, he wants you to know that he has opted to stop sourcing denim from Japan\u2014from now on, only Europe\u2014in recognition of the impact that unnecessary transportation has on climate change. Wool that comes from Scotland will stay there to be manufactured into his sweaters and, likewise, yarn from Italy. \u201cAll the little efforts will become big one day, and we all need to do it,\u201d he said. Lastly, if Mah\u00e9o\u2019s design range gives a narrow impression, he\u2019s made it clear that you will find all the newness you need in the right layering of olive green or a perfectly flattering pair of jeans. \u201cYou can\u2019t go against your DNA,\u201d he said backstage. To this end, he joked that baggy pants remain a nonstarter.

The theme was Alpinism, but it was one lightly trodden: a green velvet casual suit with climbing rope piping, the vaguely Nordic pattern on a two-zip knit jacket, and the rope-laced shoes were about as yodelayheehoo!/fondue as it got. More broadly, the mountain theme was meant to complement and inform Spencer\u2019s ongoing commitment to producing his garments and accessories in sustainable materials. The standout of those fabrics was a wool featuring wide crimped ridges about the same size as jumbo wale corduroy; in blue or gray this \u201cwool seersucker,\u201d as Spencer called it, was cut into a great trouser shape (tapered with a square panel at the knee, ski pass below the left hip, and cuffed with a popper at the hem) and matched with a version of the four-pocket collarless jacket he does so very well. Along with bombers in velvet or micro-cord teamed with similarly proportioned pants, these made for an excellently proportioned semiformal option. Spencer is a master negotiator of one of the hardest territories in menswear to scale: the middle ground. If that sounds backhanded, it isn\u2019t.

The Sumerians told tales of Gilgamesh, the Mayans built a ball court, and at the Super Bowl, players raise up the Lombardi Trophy and thank god for their victories. For twin brothers Ariel and Shimon Ovadia, the relationship between the religious and the athletic hits very close to home. When they were young children in Jerusalem, their father was a professional soccer player. When they were slightly older children in Brooklyn, they were schooled in Judaism at a yeshiva and schooled in basketball on the courts off nearby Ocean Parkway. Their Fall 2019 collection married their personal and familial histories into clothing that\u2019s subtly sporty, mystically religious, and very wantable. The first look is their mission statement: A coach\u2019s coat made of custom Scottish tweed styled over a deliciously soft black sweatsuit, it\u2019s the sort of outfit you\u2019d see on Paul Pogba as he exits the stadium. From there, the brothers turned the first photo of their father to run in Jerusalem\u2019s sports newspaper into a print; dad is midair in a bicycle kick, and the other player lays defeated on the ground. His number, five, appears throughout the collection, as do hand-drawn graphics that celebrate an immigrant\u2019s experience in America, like postcards, taxicabs, and musical notes and dancing silhouettes evoking jazz. A collaboration with Yoshida Porter extended the sporty spirit in ripstop and tapestry materials, while a leather jacket came with its own silver whistle necklace. Elsewhere, the pair referenced ancient texts and prayers that date back to the time of King Solomon, creating amulet patches to bring good fortune and printing interpretations of these texts on tees, sweatshirts, and on the inside lining of jackets. Some images are abstract statements on spirituality, like a neon pink graphic of concentric circles printed on the back of a tee. Others are more literal: \u201cAnd the lord will become king over all the earth and on that day god and his name will be one.\u201d Soccer and spiritual symbolism are the collection\u2019s main tropes, but its backbone is the Ovadias\u2019 inventive tailoring, wearable cuts, and expert fabrics. They\u2019ve mastered a leather puffa, turned track pants into suit pants with a touch of elastic at the back waist and extended grosgrain stripes at the sides, and developed a custom metallic Tyvek material that will wrinkle and wear with age. Even the heathens among us couldn\u2019t resist."}, {"Designer": "Palomo Spain", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Palomo Spain has returned to New York City, with designer Alejandro G\u00f3mez Palomo revealing his Fall collection on Manhattan\u2019s West Side early this afternoon. There was a reason, besides his love of Gotham (he showed here circa Fall 2017), for the decision: \u201cThis season is called \u20181916,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the moment that the Ballet Russes went from Russia to Spain, and Sergei Diaghilev and the Spanish avant-garde got together and created these mixed, unconventional pieces. Ballet has a lot to do with traveling around, going around in a caravan. We carry on with this attitude.\u201d There\u2019s no arguing that Palomo Spain emits nomadic feedback: Palomo\u2019s group, his tribe, is both dedicatedly fierce and fiercely dedicated. They go where he goes, whether that\u2019s Andaluc\u00eda or the Big Apple. This inherent tight-knitted-ness, plus his narratives\u2014always strong when it comes to research and personality\u2014are what make this brand so unique. And while the rearview abstraction of Diaghilev in the Iberian Peninsula initially felt a little dated, Palomo was able to entwine in it a modern heat. That came with an expanded accessories roster (including sharp new slip-on shoes and doctor bags) and new textiles, like nylon. \u201cMy take on sportswear, taken into my universe,\u201d said the designer. See: a wide-collared, short-sleeved optic white anorak, cinched at the waist, and styled over a netted dress. Another parka was done in velvet and finished with a massive bow. And yet another was made again in nylon, this time salmon-hued, curving from the shoulders to the hem in what had to have been a wink to Spain\u2019s most famous designer, Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga. Palomo\u2019s variety here was wide but calibrated; a polka-dot motif, which deteriorated into melted bubbles, shone through with a Pop Art aestheticism, while elsewhere structured and tailored trenches nodded to the original designs of the clothing type conceived by Thomas Burberry. On top of that, there were sequined bodysuits, sheer slip dresses worn over underwear made in collaboration with the Spanish lingerie brand Andres Sarda, and a raven-feathered closing dress duo. The show\u2019s soundtrack switched from orchestral strings to a gritty techno for the finale lap; it was a smart idea, as it placed these clothes, at least spatially, in a more contemporary zone. If Palomo Spain sometimes feels repetitive, or if it still seems, at times, like too much visual reverie and not enough of an exercise in commercial practicality, it\u2019s a forgivable charge. Palomo should be praised for the message he sings; his casts are always diverse, and they always include openly gay male models (being an out model can still hamper one\u2019s chances at certain jobs). And with the weather vane turning in terms of male dressing\u2014no matter how one identifies or what one\u2019s sexuality is\u2014the distinction of what is the norm will eventually be redefined. But in Palomo\u2019s world, this freedom, this openness, this love\u2014it\u2019s all already deeply entrenched and steeped in irresistible appeal."}, {"Designer": "Paria Farzaneh", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "There have been some hair-raisingly dystopian underground performances around London these past three days. The one young Paria Farzaneh put on was skeweringly on point about the social media\u2013altered existence we\u2019ve all surrendered to today. She led her fans to a hole-in-the-wall club under a railway arch and involved them in a scenario that felt like a Black Mirror episode. There was a front door at the end of a darkened runway, with a boy in a bed behind it. Suddenly, the unmistakable, piercingly loud, universally despised sound of an iPhone alarm went off. The boy got up, stepped through the door and onto the \u201cstreet,\u201d phone in his hand. As we all do. Only the street wasn\u2019t a street but a rolling conveyor belt. The boy stood still, raised his phone, checked himself out, and started videotaping himself as he moved along. Almost as one, the audience auto-responded by lifting their own phones\u2014as we do, at fashion shows\u2014and videotaped him videotaping himself. All the boy models\u2014and a couple of girls\u2014then did exactly the same, before stepping through the transparent plastic curtains of a room that looked like a sterile decontamination unit. With a loaded irony pointed at our obsession with posting every second of our existence, Farzaneh titled her show Here, Right Now. \u201cIt\u2019s the mundanity of it. The alarm we all have. The conveyor belt we\u2019re all on. People aren\u2019t thinking what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wish people would put their phones down, start looking each other in the eye, and start talking.\u201d Ironies within Black Mirror ironies: Backstage, the models were taking photos of themselves, and the audience lingered until they\u2019d pressed post on their Instagram feeds. Instagram is where what happened in the club lives. But Farzaneh only posted still photos of the clothes she\u2019d designed. You see them here. They were a stepped-up development of what she\u2019s established in two short seasons\u2014clothes that retain her British-Iranian identity in the printed fabrics, a stamp now implanted more as a detail in piping and some terrific laminated cross-body bags. But she\u2019s moving on into smarter, more tailored looks and some terrific hand-knits, too. And beyond the salutary commentary she delivered about screen-dominated consciousness, she had another message for her youth following. \u201cI feel it\u2019s time we get away from the streetwear movement. That\u2019s fast fashion now.

Mary Godwin, her lover Percy Shelley, and their traveling companion Lord Byron decided to have a competition to see who could come up with the creepiest horror story. In a dream, Godwin imagined Frankenstein: Even though she was just 18, her story was unanimously declared the winner. Two of the most feted poets of their age knew brilliance when they saw it. If there was a competition among fashion designers today, Miuccia Prada would, you\u2019d wager, trounce the overwhelmingly male opposition.Tonight in the Fondazione she presented a monster of a collection\u2014dark and alienated, but twistedly pretty too\u2014that will have her acolytes stumbling, entranced, to the stores.

It was set against a very tough world\u2014that is why war and military was in the air. But to make it not boring and for the fashion\u2014because fashion has to be light somehow\u2014we borrowed the symbols of trashy horror movies. From Frankenstein to The Rocky Horror Picture Show and all those movies. Frankenstein is the example of the monster with a big, big heart who searches for love.\u201d That\u2019s why Gigi Hadid was in a cutely pleated, crystal-studded gown that Janet Reiss would have relished. And why the models walked among 120 oversize light bulbs with helter-skelter elements glowing in the gloom. And why menswear shirting featured lightning bolts zigzagging to the heart, or the closing knitwear pieces\u2014the Pradaphile trophies of the season\u2014featured felt hearts attached by safety pin. Beneath the horror\u2014the horror!\u2014Prada was doing the time warp (again), to compelling effect. All in black or gray, the men\u2019s suiting was classic boxy-shouldered, high-notch-lapelled house fare. Triple-belting distracted the eye, but was a styling detail. For women, the fitted, strapped off-shoulder silhouette, also classic to the house, was presented in its barest and hence possibly most versatile and desirable form. One strapless black dress featuring six billows pockets\u2014a sort of field dress\u2014was a fabulous contrast of distilled femininity and military. There were jackdaw, trophy-post asides in boldly colored marabou trimmings on hats and shoulders. Many of the models were heaped with backpacks worn high on the back that pushed the sternum forward. Mrs. P was almost dismissive of this detail. She was much more interested in the origin story of Frankenstein and Mary Godwin, who first released her yarn in 1818, anonymously. \u201cThis woman in the 19th century, she could not publish her book. She invented Frankenstein but the poet Shelley had to publish it . . . because they didn\u2019t publish a book written by a woman.\u201d At this Prada paused and assumed a satisfied expression: \u201cAlthough it seems that in literature now, if you are not a woman you don\u2019t sell.

Now look how the world has caught up with the pioneer: Raeburn was recently appointed global creative director of Timberland, a fact manifested on his runway in several Timberland x Raeburn pieces, which were made in the brand\u2019s original shapes but reinterpreted in the designer\u2019s typical fabrics, including decommissioned British military parachutes. After audience eyeballs had followed such details as the patchwork army green Raeburn Cut \u2019n\u2019 Shut technique and noted the new funnel-neck scarves (which would be so handy for withstanding the upcoming weather onslaughts of January and February Fashion Weeks), it was backstage to congratulate Raeburn for all he\u2019s achieved in setting up such a credible, authentically functional brand. The jam-packed crowd, diverse in age and every other sense, attested to the fact that the sustainable and the ethical is now a concern that everyone wants to be in on.

The specter that sudden severance of a lauded major designer raised was more general. Does it herald the death, or at least the belittling, of creativity and meaning in fashion? Simons had a tangential answer to that. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be negative,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to do something abstract and beautiful and elegant and proud and sophisticated, but without losing the edge of what the brand stands for: the young generation, the dark movies.\u201d Well, he delivered on that, in a show dominated by dramatically long silhouettes\u2014they\u2019d be called maxi coats on a woman\u2014which came freighted with all the kinds of messages Simons\u2019s cult followers find gratifying to decode.

As for him personally? He said that the outpouring of feeling from fans and supporters over the past few weeks was something that \u201cmakes me very proud and happy. You start to think about how scale starts to become completely irrelevant. The size of something. The size of a company. Big or small.

Surridge started off today with one of Cavalli\u2019s signature tiger prints. His idea was to abstract it using many colors so it didn\u2019t look quite so literal. The results on a round-shouldered but otherwise sharp double-breasted coat were bold, like we expect from Cavalli. The show ended with a white tuxedo, its sartorial aspect nodding more to Surridge\u2019s own roots than the house founder\u2019s.

These appeared alongside more of the clean tailoring he likes, which he gave womanly curves by cutting the trousers with a super-high waistband and tapering the legs above the ankles.

And it\u2019s a subject that came to mind as Anthony Vaccarello\u2019s superconfident new collection for Saint Laurent marched past\u2014starting with look number 2, a broad-shouldered, ivory wool coat modeled by a 21st-century doppelg\u00e4nger of the YSL muse Betty Catroux, complete with signature sideswept peroxide mane and black shades. Since his arrival nearly three years ago, Vaccarello has seemed comfortable to explore the parts of Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s legacy that most closely align with his own\u2014briefly: anything short, short, short. But spanning 40 years as it does, YSL\u2019s oeuvre is vast. Vaccarello\u2019s latest explored several eras or moments of that legacy, but the aspect that had everyone in the audience so jazzed tonight was the tailoring, which was strong, almost man-size, and focused on the shoulders. In a preview, Vaccarello said he spent six months getting the proportions right and that they were built up with padding to extend two centimeters beyond the shoulder seams. \u201cThe show pieces are all done by hand,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to figure out how to perfect it [in the factory].\u201d Vaccarello is loath to psychoanalyze his motivations, but many in the audience were fully prepared to do so. There\u2019s an old-fashioned rivalry brewing in Paris (something that YSL and Lagerfeld knew plenty about, as it happens; read The Beautiful Fall for all the fabulous details), and competition, as they say, is good for business. As for why Instagram lit up afterward with photos of those boss coats, Vaccarello does have a theory. \u201cShe\u2019s not making war; she\u2019s not a combatant. But she is really strong; she\u2019s fearless.\u201d Many of us respond to that silhouette, especially in our current dark times. The designer\u2019s other subjects this season were YSL\u2019s Opium moment and the haute couture \u201cScandal\u201d collection of Spring 1971. The former produced all manner of lavishly worked beaded evening jackets, worn with micro-shorts, Swiss-dot stockings, and knee boots for a modern vibe. The latter was Vaccarello\u2019s Pop reinterpretation of Saint Laurent\u2019s own revisionist take on World War II\u2013era clothing, which was critically panned at the time but went on to become influential in the street. This section of the show was harder to see, with the models walking behind a wall of glass, in black light, with a Yayoi Kusama Infinity Room mirror situation behind them.

Andrew\u2019s approach to ready-to-wear has been to start with the shoes; \u201cdressing toe to head\u201d is the way he put it. Fall began with a shoe from 1942, a multicolored patchwork suede wedge that\u2019s a kissing cousin to the famous 1938 rainbow platform made for Judy Garland. It provided the collection\u2019s kaleidoscopic palette and the patchwork motif that ran through it. Not that it ever got too theme-y. The vivid colors he\u2019s adopted aside, the Ferragamo aesthetic under Andrew is understated and elegant, a point he has reinforced with his multigenerational casting. The sensationally chill Liisa Winkler scored the show\u2019s hero piece, a generously proportioned robe coat that looked like shearling but was actually fleecy pulled cashmere. That coat silhouette also looked great in a bordeaux-hued leather. Under designer Guillaume Meilland, the menswear standout was a neatly tailored three-button coat with silk satin lapels\u2014classic but with a wink. There was a whole family of shoes on the runway, from dainty flats sprayed with crystals to satin tango numbers to knee boots with angular heels inspired by a 1968 shoe from the archive.

At a juncture when we\u2019re becoming more and more disposed to buy less, as McCartney herself advocates, she\u2019s also expanding her proposition for men.

For McCartney, it\u2019s a double whammy, involving either animal bones or harmful solvents. Bye glue, hello Loop.

Messina and Rizzo also ramped up knitwear; the highlight here was a crewneck sweater in windowpane maroon and white. There was a lot to take in.

Believe it or not, but tonight Poe traveled not only in time, but also between two fashion dimensions (as a recurring motif in this evening\u2019s double-headed collaboration between Valentino and Undercover, presented back to back on the Paris schedule). As Jun Takahashi confirmed when asked afterwards about the significance of Poe, that crazy \u201ctime traveler\u201d theory was the basis of the unlikely web of connections across two fashion shows tonight. Watching this Undercover show delivered the source code\u2014and the logic behind it\u2014for many of the graphics we had already seen on the runway of Pierpaolo Piccioli (who was here and said afterwards he planned to order at least 25 pieces from Takahashi\u2019s collection). This collection was an built around Stanley Kubrick\u2019s A Clockwork Orange, his 1971 film adaptation of Anthony Burgess\u2019s short but shocking dystopian novel of ultraviolence and state-administered extreme psychiatry. Malcolm McDowell\u2019s saturnine features in his role as the protagonist Alex\u2014sometimes sinisterly smirking beneath bowler, sometimes bloodily fanged, sometimes with eyes clamped open\u2014was repeated on the garments. So too were fragments of Nadsat\u2014Alex\u2019s melodious bastard dialect\u2014and the face of Beethoven (\u201cthe old Ludwig Van\u201d) and recording details of the Berlin Philharmonic microcassette that Alex plays as part of his flawed aversion therapy. But. Unlike Takahashi\u2019s masterful Pitti paean to 2001: A Space Odyssey, this was a collection that voyaged\u2014via Poe\u2014in time as well as space and Kubrick. The invitation was a cropped section of Caravaggio\u2019s Supper at Emmaus (the version in London\u2019s National Gallery) that shows the flung-wide arm of Cleopas and his scallop shell pilgrim\u2019s brooch. This was a heavy hint. In the opening section of the show a group of models emerged wearing musketeer-ishly feathered bowlers hats, businesslike gauntlets, and cloaks tethered by ropes. Jarringly they also carried laser-pointer canes and wore technical trainers with IV-tube detailing. They swaggered about, in a fair attempt at menace. As the show unfolded, cutting back and forth between early-17th-century streetwear and Clockwork Orange\u2013inflected contemporary equivalents, it seemed that Takahashi was reimagining Caravaggio as Alex. This made a biographical sense, sort of. Because although the painter created work of eternal beauty he was apparently quite the roistering belligerent beast when not at the easel. He once beat up a waiter because he thought his artichokes had been badly cooked, and he ended his life on the run for murder after killing a man in a duel, apparently over a tennis game. So this Undercover man was Alex, and Caravaggio as Alex, along with his time-traveling banda droogs. Poe acted as trans-dimensional connective membrane and Beethoven via Wendy Carlos delivered the musical accompaniment. There was also a section that delivered Takahashi\u2019s take on the flying saucer, Poe, and Beethoven graphics first presented at Valentino just two hours previously. It was meta-meta. \u201cLike silvery wine flowing in a spaceship, gravity all nonsense now,\u201d this was a collection that stretched your gulliver wide open but was worth the stretching: horrorshow fashion show.

A Diptyque candle burned in the foyer of Galerie Perrotin in the Marais; Taverniti was gracious and chatty as usual, but he seemed more at ease. His brand is well-established at this point, and stocked widely, but the conviction with which he described the collection was the main reason for his demeanor: \u201cI\u2019ve scaled back,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it got too big, and I was trying to satisfy too many people. I\u2019ve always designed for myself, and I started to feel like I was becoming somehow... incorrect.

There was still a strong Instagram it-girl vibe, as well as the label's signature graphic mash-ups, but the silhouette is now more refined. For women, this could be seen through jackets that had been given a more body-conscious, shapely cut, or normcore-meets-elegant satin shirting. T-shirts, too, even had a vague kind of elevation\u2014they featured twists and drapes and keyhole cutouts. For men, there were cropped puffer coats that could be unzipped and worn in cape-like fashion. Trousers had busy pocket details but tops were clean-lined and smooth. Lastly, Unravel would not be Unravel without some bite: When talking with his team about prints, which he\u2019s not a fan of, Taverniti said \u201cfuck your print.\u201d That phrase\u2014surprise\u2014became the print, and was screened onto tees and sweatshirts."}, {"Designer": "Valentino", "Season": "Men's Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "It was a tale of two bros, really. Pierpaolo Piccioli met Jun Takahashi of Undercover when Valentino put on its show in Tokyo at the end of last year. Takahashi and Piccioli decided to collaborate on prints that would appear in both of their menswear collections, one after the other. \u201cIt\u2019s a social experiment!\u201c Piccioli said backstage as the Valentino boys were lining up. Takahashi has done the artwork\u2014themed on Edgar Allan Poe\u2014with time traveler slogans, spaceships, skulls, and a joint VU logo for the Valentino-Undercover-branded bits. But the double-faced shapes and the thinking are still very Pierpaolo. He said he\u2019d been looking at the fluidity of Italian tailoring in the 1980s\u2014there was a Herb Ritts photo of a louchely relaxed Valentino suit on the mood board\u2014but the learning he took from that was thinking how to integrate sportswear into it. \u201cTo me, Valentino is a couture house, but to be relevant today, it has to be more inclusive and open to new opportunities. That\u2019s my idea, always.\u201d So up came another idea: a collaboration with Birkenstock. \u201cIt is a shoe that has universality, like denim. It has no gender, no status,\u201c he said. But Birks in winter? \u201cHa! They\u2019re seasonless too,\u201d he laughed, pointing at the models\u2019 feet. \u201cJust wear them with socks.\u201d Piccioli is adamant that men are not going to give up streetwear, or at least the comfort that goes with it, anytime soon. \u201cI\u2019m not going to renounce sneakers and put back on shoes every day!\u201c he said. \u201cSo the thing is to find a new way to integrate sportswear. To have a coat with the ease of a hoodie.\u201d Still, there\u2019s a distinct Italian-accented glamour about what Piccioli showed.

Although Donatella Versace was not available to talk about the collection this Milan Fashion Week, she did grant an interview to formerly-of-this-parish Alex Fury in The Financial Times. In it, she addressed the \u201cKorsace\u201d question that panicked fans of the house have been pondering: Would the deal dilute Versace\u2019s Versace-ness? Her response: \u201cI don\u2019t know why people thought Versace is becoming like Michael Kors? A medium, lower line. I mean with all due respect to Michael Kors . . . .\u201d Ha! Vintage Versace. This indomitable diva who once joked that her beauty routine is to sleep in her freezer tells it like it is. She also stressed that she would never allow Versace\u2019s sneakers\u2014which, for good measure, she added she would never herself wear\u2014to be made in China, so as not to compromise on made-in-Italy excellence. For those who harbored further doubts that Donatella would take her hand off the tiller now the Kors billions have rolled in, tonight\u2019s collection proved a convincing rebuff. Encompassing men\u2019s and an expensively cast\u2014Adut Akech, Kaia Gerber, Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski\u2014Pre-Fall women\u2019s, this collection was riotously true to the supermodel-mentoring history of the house. The opening section dipped heavily into the early 1990s bondage iconography Gianni had such fun with. Printed harness T-shirts for men, leather pants, and open-backed black silk jackets for men and women tethered by more harnessing provided the slap and tickle. It was sexy and provocative, which was the point. Suits for both genders accessorized with safety pins looked back to another famous way-back-when Versace moment. Then the focus broadened. For men, fluoro knits with contrasting fluoro lace linings were future-kinky. More eye-watering color combinations dilated your pupils, softening the impact of the interesting coalescences between Gianni-print sportswear and gelateria-tone tailoring. The logo-heavy interaction with Ford was a little strange, especially in the context of an Italian thoroughbred asserting its aristocracy, but deals are deals. After a street style\u2013heavy middle section, the collection reverted back to the ostentatiously violent black tailoring, lace, and print that was and forever will be Versace\u2019s meat and drink.

But we only see 20 percent of it\u2014behind that is the part you don\u2019t know about. I didn\u2019t. So we found some people who know how to access the dark net, behind the wall you can\u2019t see. I didn\u2019t know about it, but you can buy guns, drugs, people, order things with kids\u2014anything you want, with Bitcoin. It\u2019s crazy, scary stuff. And you have perfect freedom to do it, because no one can see you, you have no identity.\u201d Identity politics with a whole new savage twist, then. The show was held in the French National Museum of Natural History, around an uncomfortably close display of exotic stuffed animals. The invitation arrived in what had seemed like a jolly, hand-drawn illustration of cute animals on a jiffy bag.

There is a dark side to humanity the censors won\u2019t let you see, but we will. View it at your own risk. What came next looked, for the most part, like a bunch of kids dressed to riot. At a time when there are indeed riots in Paris every Saturday\u2014targeting landmarks and stores\u2014we had truly entered the upside-down of fashion, and Gvasalia seemed to mean that almost literally. There were upside-down anarchy symbols; upended puffer jackets and T-shirts; misspelled but recognizable corporate logos; a faked Interpol sign (\u201clooks like Russian, but isn\u2019t\u201d). \u201cMade in Europe\u201d was printed on a track pant leg in the same fashion as U.S. prisonwear. \u201cWhat is Europe now? It\u2019s basically collapsing all around us.\u201d No: Vetements is one brand that has not rescinded its alliance with streetwear. \u201cI feel this is Vetements territory, and I feel I want to own it,\u201d Gvasalia said. There were references to many things that have become Vetements-isms: printed dresses, some chunky-jacketed pantsuits, and socks that are now sock-shoes, the antidote to the chunky dad trainer that Gvasalia invented, but has now been the first to swear off. Then came the really uncomfortable bit: the black fleece masks inside hoodies, the parkas with flaps extending right over the face, with a peep-hole for looking out, or for taking photos through. Gvasalia laughed at the idea that he\u2019s designed the latter for himself. \u201cI realize there is no privacy. When I\u2019m on public transport, doing work on my phone, I often see people overlooking it, or taking photographs of me.\u201d It struck all sorts of sinister chords about surveillance society, facial recognition technology. In a nutshell: fear. Gvasalia took a big risk with this show. It will undoubtedly be condemned as politically insensitive for a fashion label to have made a show with what looked like a gilets jaunes jacket bottom half. He is not mealy-mouthed about that though. \u201cI know why they are not happy. I understand the revolt of the people. It\u2019s a general problem of the world, the gap between rich and poor. And this is a third world war\u2014whatever you want to call it.\u201d The thing about Gvasalia and his brother Guram is that they know what trouble looks like, because they\u2019ve lived through a civil war themselves. They see what\u2019s happening\u2014the in-the-streets stuff and the stuff that lurks in the dark places. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot run off from it.

This is a potentially below-the-waterline mine of a topic to negotiate for a brand predicated on authenticity. However, as The Wall Street Journal suggested in its analysis of the mill\u2019s last days, it has been on life support for many years now. In fact, that life seems to have been extended by the revenue generated by its former European licensee, now creative director, Bologna, Italy\u2013based Andrea Cane.

We have been working with another mill since forever, and that mill, which is more organized, has been giving us the majority of our fabric. You know our mill is very old. In the last 20 years they didn\u2019t spend one penny to fix it.\u201d He added: \u201cFor sure we are going to keep it as a museum. But it is very difficult.

And, apparently, the recent Woolrich campaign fronted by Lauryn Hill, her first, made a splash. But the real story here is how globalization and lax management have combined to make it economically unfeasible for the Woolrich mill to continue churning out the blankets and shirts that have kept so many generations warm, and which have supported a town for nearly 200 years. Cane was the one, years ago, who realized the international potential of this great American brand\u2014somewhat underappreciated in America\u2014and whose endeavor allowed the mill to operate as long as it did.

Another attractive shell jacket, this one black, featured a charging pocket in which you only had to slip your phone for it to start gaining juice wirelessly. Both of these features were invisible, but there was plenty of displayable technicity, too. One feature that ran through the collection were pants tapered by a double-tabbed velcro fastening, inspired by cycling clips. These looked very cool, especially with the little flashes of reflecting material on the back of each tab. Other trousers and shirts came inset with webbing into which you could attach portage: a military-sourced, functionally driven feature that happens to look badass. Sneakers featured a new sole designed in conjunction with Vibram; made of a honeycomb of nodules connecting the sole of the shoe and the bottom, these allow air to run through the structure and, apparently, reduce humidity in the shoe. Another sneaker feature was a magnetic clasp that functioned like laces and which also featured on some garments. This sounded a very satisfying metallic snikk when engaged.

In reality, so much of what makes a collection sustainable actually isn\u2019t tangible. Abdul Abasi and Greg Rosborough\u2019s spring 2020 menswear presentation was a reminder of that. Yesterday, they showed 12 variations on the navy suit, from their signature curvy blazer to new experiments with jacquard and leather, plus a \u201cshirt suit\u201d for the guy who feels restricted even by their ribbed-knit paneled jackets. Design-wise, there were touches of an Eastern influence in the kimono vests and wrap details, and they introduced a few sportier pieces, like a cobalt parka and satin bomber. It was sleeker and simpler than what the duo showed for fall 2019, but the pared-back approach belied the innovation happening behind the scenes: Abasi and Rosborough\u2019s biggest strides came in the actual design and production process, before these clothes were even made. They\u2019ve spent the past few seasons learning about virtual reality, and have figured out how to design \u201c99 percent\u201d of a garment virtually, without using any resources whatsoever. That means they can experiment with silhouette, fabric, and proportion without wasting any fabric or time. Their fellow designers will recognize the implications of that. How much gets thrown away in the sampling process? And how many of those samples never even make it into the show? As we grow more conscious of the way we buy, wear, and discard clothes, it\u2019s important to consider the waste that happens (or doesn\u2019t) before we even make the purchase. Still, it\u2019s important that designers maintain a human touch. \u201cWhen you think about these futuristic ideas and designs, they often feel really synthetic,\u201d Rosborough said. \u201cWe intentionally only use natural fibers, like cotton, wool, cashmere, linen. We\u2019re not going into hyper-tech nylons. It\u2019s about keeping it natural, and mixing these ancient fibers with the most innovative technology.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Balenciaga", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Fashion people are constantly racking their brains about what makes fashion relevant, but there\u2019s no one like Demna Gvasalia for ushering an audience into a situation where the state of world affairs can bite so viscerally. He set his Balenciaga Spring collection in a political arena\u2014a faux \u201cBalenciaga parliament or assembly,\u201d which he\u2019d convened to investigate the subject of \u201cpower dressing and fashion uniforms.\u201d So there we sat, in an auditorium Gvasalia had pointedly smothered wall-to-wall in a color not far off the blue of the EU flag, to view his socio-design study of the structure of today\u2019s dress codes. Senior delegates\u2014women and men in tailoring, a severe, anonymous, identically suited corporate presence\u2014opened the show. Who were they? On their breast pockets were embroidered badges, two discs bisected with a Balenciaga logo\u2014a construct not dissimilar to the Mastercard design. Then came what Gvasalia called the campaign dresses. \u201cWe looked at pictures of women politicians, of what they wear campaigning. We took this type of tailored daywear dress and tried to make it cool\u2014not an easy challenge, to be honest,\u201d he said. His solution was to \u201cmake them more boxy and cocoon-y, which is quite Balenciaga. So many body types can wear it. Democratic and easy-to-wear volumes.\u201d All the while a bombastic, pounding, semi-militaristic, horror-movie soundtrack insistently filled the space, mixed by Lo\u00efk Gomez, Gvasalia\u2019s partner. The cast of characters\u2014they were named in the show notes as doctors, lawyers, gallerists, and engineers as well as professional models\u2014kept on coming. The closer you looked, the more you saw the prosthetically augmented jutting cheekbones, the blown-up lips. It was subtly terrifying. Relevance, in Gvasalia\u2019s mind, is equal parts sharp observation of what people wear and a focus on creating something that somehow relates back to the heritage of Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga. That takes us to the crinoline dresses right at the end\u2014almost a child\u2019s cartoon fantasy in their bouncy silhouettes. \u201cBallroom dresses go back to the beginning of Balenciaga, when [Crist\u00f3bal] started in Spain. It was mostly this type of silhouette he did, from Spanish painting,\u201d Gvasalia observed. \u201cBut we wanted to make sure they were wearable. If you take out the crinoline, you have a sort of goth dress.\u201d In the middle, there was a Dynasty-era section, with huge shoulders and the fashion glitz that went with oil-rich couture patrons all those years back. What were their 2020 avatars doing, stalking the corridors of power today? No need to answer that. We felt the fear, we saw the clothes. Some of it\u2014the jersey sport pants, motocross pants, and tailored jackets\u2014looked as if it will jibe with that young generation of male shoppers who are looking for a style upgrade from hoodies. Gvasalia senses the social shifts there too. Asked if he considered this collection to be a paring back of shape and a honing in on reality, he came right back with an answer that resonated beyond his pragmatic design issues (easy clothes to feel powerful in) or the diverse personality casting: \u201cReality? I don\u2019t think it gets more real than this.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Gucci", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Alessandro Michele is a natural provocateur, but the beginning of this Gucci show might have been his most outrageous yet. The red-lit room flashed white; corrugated metal gates cranked open; and 21 models wearing white straitjackets or variations of emerged from backstage and proceeded slowly across the runway\u2019s moving walkways. Then the lights went out and it was suddenly over. How to read such a startling prelude? As usual, Michele\u2019s elaborate show notes offered a clue: \u201cFashion has a function: to let people walk through fields of possibilities . . . sacralizing every form of diversity, [and] feeding indispensable self-determination skills.\u201d It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that as a designer Michele is among the most influential forces in fashion\u2014if not the most influential force. He\u2019s made maximalists of former minimalists and turned the world on to vintage of all eras, cacophonic color and print, logos, glitter, and gender fluidity most of all. These days Gucci is an adjective and even 11-year-olds recognize the green-red-green stripe when they see it on people in the street (I know; I have an 11-year-old). The resulting rise in Gucci\u2019s fortunes has been nothing short of staggering, but numbers don\u2019t go up forever. And even a look as eclectic as the one Michele formulated for the brand becomes a uniform after a while. How to read those straitjackets, then? On the eve of his fifth anniversary as creative director, it was time to break free. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of getting bored,\u201d he said at a postshow press conference. \u201cI always have to try something new.\u201d Slate cleaned, the second part of the show began. It wasn\u2019t as abrupt a change as that dramatic opening salvo suggested, but Michele\u2019s eye has shifted. Regard the preponderance of black, a color he\u2019s more or less shunned until now. And consider the near absence of print. Instead he used graphic color-blocking to add interest to tailoring that evoked the lean lines of the brand\u2019s \u201970s heyday and Tom Ford\u2019s \u201990s reinterpretations of same. The biggest shocker was Michele\u2019s embrace of sexiness. He has typically preferred quirk to kink, but not today. Riding crops (a reference to S&M and the house\u2019s equestrian heritage) accessorized lace-inset slip dresses, and black vinyl chokers put the finishing touch on scoop-neck leotards and high-slit midi skirts. Tailor labels on the sleeve cuffs and pant hems of those \u201970s-by-way-of-\u201990s suits read Gucci Orgasmique or Gucci Eterotopia. Michele\u2019s got a merchandiser\u2019s gift for the things that grab the eye, like those exposed brand tags. His goal here seemed different; he\u2019s turned his attention from surface details to silhouette. That\u2019s a more ambitious project because it\u2019s more subtle. But if there\u2019s anyone who can convert a generation to a what\u2019s-old-is-new-again brand of elegance, it\u2019s him."}, {"Designer": "Bally", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Nicolas Girotto, the new-ish internally promoted CEO at Bally, talks a good talk. At this presentation, held in a stylized imagining of a Swiss House, he mentioned an excellent Bally initiative this year to remove around a ton of rubbish from the upper reaches of Mount Everest. He added that the company is working hard to pivot its operations to ensure they are, from base to peak, environmentally irreproachable, but conceded that it is a work in progress. That there were only 10 looks for each gender presented here was also to infer a leaner, more resource-conscious outlook from this venerable brand. Yet Girotto admitted that, of course, much more was on offer behind the scenes. And when I visited Bally in June the then commercial-facing showroom was packed to the rafters with much, much, more menswear merch than was on display this week. Many of Milan\u2019s most successful fashion executives live just across the Swiss border in Lugano. This is apparently solely for tax reasons, but if Bally\u2019s vision of a typical Swiss house is accurate, perhaps there\u2019s more to it. Models lolled around on sofas, mattresses, or even reclined on banks of mussed grass in an appealingly textured clapboard structure (which reps assured was all to be recycled and reused). For women stand-out garments included a long black dress in irregularly diagonal-pitched panels of silk and lace whose slant reflected the line of the kitten heel worn with it, as well as some typically sharp suiting (Bally is really excellent at this). For men there was a lovely zippered compartment jacket in ombr\u00e9 textured orange leather, an Alpine print double-faced shirt, and some substantial double-faced khaki pants. There were also pieces of leather shirting and trousers which seemed unlikely ever to ascend into the retail arena."}, {"Designer": "Burberry", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Here is a counterintuitive thought: Burberry becomes better when Riccardo Tisci lets himself put more of his own Italian self into it. His knowledge of the craft of cutting and draping, acquired in Paris at Givenchy, his European instinct for sophisticated sexiness and his affinity for modern fabrics are some of his natural strengths. That, and his proven track record in bringing diversity to the runway and garnering the following of a youth audience. Notwithstanding the corporate responsibility of somehow finding ways to represent the Britishness of Burberry to the world (the most confusing of tasks when even the British themselves are notoriously divided over what on earth that signifies) the more Tisci permits himself to be true to his personal sensibilities, the more the collection moves towards a distinctive signature. After three seasons, he says, the market has started to respond. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a big job. When I arrived, I wanted to go slowly. Now I start to feel more comfortable in my place, to understand a different London,\u201d he said after the show. \u201cThe trench and the check are going to be forever-icons of the house, but society changed, the world is changing and now people want to wear different things\u2014and it doesn\u2019t matter which country it comes from. So the globalization of style is a different approach for me today.\u201d Specifically, he said, \u201cTailoring has started to do super-well, especially for women; the chiffon blouses, sport things and the eveningwear which was not developed before.\u201d Zoom to the suits\u2014inside-out sartorial fits, with the white bindings showing, and to the run of developments in gray jersey, used in tailoring (women\u2019s and men\u2019s), coats and slinky but classy dresses. Allora: this is very much an Italian way of designing, with an innate awareness of how to dress smartly in a warm climate, utilizing the subtle structure of modern fabrics. Monochrome, grays and khakis were Tisci\u2019s through line for most of the show, with many variations of tonal tailoring ranging from modern businessperson suiting to short, leggy skirt suits with dippy hems in back. It helped that he\u2019d dropped the distinction between the bourgeois and the edgy youth looks which had divided previous showings. This looked closer to elevation and consideration of design values across generations\u2014a wise move when persuading customers to invest in a luxury fashion brand. For young guys, to be sure, there were heartland Tisci-isms in the oversized rugby shirts, but the one pair of the baggy shorts that have been his signature since Givenchy days came covered in white lace and with a lace panel fluttering from the back of the matching T-shirt. Along with Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton and Kim Jones at Dior, Tisci is moving the Burberry culture towards a new kind of decorative masculinity. Genuine voices and authentic skills are what make designers stand out today\u2014and in a competitive climate, the powers of true fashion leaders, rather than mere brand operatives, are at a premium. Where Tisci says he connects with Burberry\u2019s heritage is in the Victorian roots of its founder. Gothic Victorianism was an obsession of the young Italian from the outset of his career. We saw it surface amongst the white lace dresses he showed among the pretty, feathered and besparkled eveningwear: an appealing reclaiming of his own background in haute couture. And there was an accessory certain to get people talking: a merge of baseball cap and Victorian bonnet. From side view, the face-concealing peaks triggered audience members to draw comparisons to Handmaid\u2019s Tale headgear. It was purely accidental. Asked about it, Tisci drew a blank. He\u2019s not watched the series. As far as he\u2019s concerned, it\u2019s just a fun part of his mission to make Burberry great again."}, {"Designer": "Margaret Howell", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Excuse me for this, but I am going to go out on a limb and talk about the show after Margaret Howell\u2019s before we even get to what she showed on the runway. (Bear with me, there\u2019s a method to this madness.) Victoria Beckham was up after Margaret Howell, and outside her show was a quiet and respectful demonstration from the London chapter of Extinction Rebellion. Pre\u2013London shows, there was plenty of chatter about the eco-activist group shutting down the city\u2019s Fashion Week. So far that hasn\u2019t happened, but truth be told does it even need to? Anyone attending the run of Spring 2020 shows can\u2019t not be thinking about the environmental impact of fashion and what it means to be seeing new clothes at a time when we\u2019re consuming and discarding at an ever faster clip. There\u2019s a growing sense that whatever we buy from now on\u2014and a moment of unflinching, cold-light-of-day reality here: continue to buy we will\u2014had better come with some value, some staying power, some sense of it making a meaningful contribution to our wardrobes. This brings us to\u2014you knew we\u2019d get there eventually\u2014Margaret Howell, a designer whose long-standing raison d\u2019\u00eatre has been to go slow and steady while others around her were losing their heads going fast and frenetic. Her collection for next season, regardless of whether it\u2019s for women or for men (she showed both on her runway, at the Rambert dance school in the shadow of the National Theatre), demonstrated yet again her enviably strong and definitive handwriting\u2014utilitarian, tailored, unfussy\u2014which, by its thoughtful and considerate inclusivity, allows for all sorts of individual entry points into her look. Hers is a vocabulary of clothes\u2014the trench, the shirt, the blazer\u2014she reexamines and reinvents by fractional degrees, the easier to keep and make your own. For Spring 2020 that means plenty of suiting, with higher buttoning; looser-cut jackets worn with tapering trousers tucked into slouchy socks and flat leather sandals; and other times substantially collared shirts atop fluid Bermuda shorts, again with the omnipresent socks-and-sandals combo. Often they came out in mirror-image gender pairings, effectively the same outfit on a guy, then a girl, or vice versa. Howell has long presented the case for the notion of gender irrelevance, prioritizing a sense of naturalness and comfort over the artifice and affect of fashion; so the olive cotton parka on a guy was cut with the same swinging ease as a drop-waisted dress worn by a woman. There was also a terrific \u201950s abstract linear print that evoked the work of textile designer Lucienne Day, whose graphic patterns appeared at another time when Britain was undergoing a moment of profound change and self-examination. Who\u2019s to say if there wasn\u2019t a sly nod to the current landscape of the United Kingdom as it renegotiates where it is in the world, but the one certainty is that Howell\u2019s clothes exuded a sense of relevance and realness to our lives today. Any one of the looks in this show could have walked straight off the runway onto the street\u2014and last for years to come. Right now that feels like the very best way to be and no higher compliment to pay."}, {"Designer": "Michael Kors Collection", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "No one has ever mistaken Michael Kors for a pessimist, but especially now, when divisiveness is tearing at the fabric of America, he believes in the power of positivity. \u201cAs the world gets worse, it\u2019s the only ammunition we have,\u201d Kors said. Over the summer, he and his husband, Lance LePere, visited Ellis Island and learned about his immigrant grandparents\u2019 arrival to the United States. \u201cThe experience made me feel more patriotic, more open,\u201d he said. That rubbed off on the new collection. As ever, Kors made an exploration of American sportswear, giving it a \u201940s slant because that was the last moment that the country felt united. \u201cThe world was in upheaval, and Americans rolled up their sleeves and got to work,\u201d Kors said. He staged the show at a warehouse in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where much of that World War II\u2013era work got done. Jennifer Egan\u2019s recent novel Manhattan Beach painted a vivid picture of New York in those years, when women went to work in droves, many for the first time. Kors reimagined the period in his characteristic upbeat and tony way. The palette was red, white, and blue, or primary bright, and dresses were sprinkled with lemon and cherry prints. Tailoring, always a strength chez Kors, had a can-do tenor, cut in classic tattersalls and menswear plaids with military details. Nicole Kidman, who sat front row alongside Kate Hudson and Yalitza Aparicio, seemed particularly taken by a neatly cut double-breasted navy romper with gold crystal pinstripes. The trick with looking decades back into the past is finding techniques to renew the silhouettes for today. One way Kors went about it is by adding metal studding to various pieces\u2014punk being the flip side of prep. As with the star-and-anchor embroideries, a little of that went a long way. The nipped waist, strong-shouldered dresses of the \u201940s need little adjusting. They\u2019re perennials, and the ones he showed today will sell like hotcakes. It doesn\u2019t get more \u201cnow\u201d than a statement tee. Kors cut his in cashmere (what else?), with the intarsia word hate crossed out on the front. To help him make his point, he hired the Young People\u2019s Chorus of New York City (the third chorus this week) to sing Don McLean and Simon & Garfunkel hits.

Timing is an art, and of late, many of the designer\u2019s rereleases are dictated by which of her vintage pieces are trending on Instagram; hence the reappearance of the Puli jumpsuit (Look 59) for Spring.

Speaking of art, Kamali has updated her parachute coat with a metallic silver nylon that is almost as shiny as one of Jeff Koons\u2019s reflective pieces. We talk a lot in the office about adapting swimwear for city life. Kamali, who is noted for her skills in this area, makes it easy with bra tops and other convertible pieces (another signature).

These pieces will sell, but the first half was stronger. Chavarria\u2019s most notable strength rests in his calibration of queerness and masculinity (especially so when that calibration involves his Chicano background). Yet there is something resolutely femme, too, in the afterburn. He mentioned that gender fluidity doesn\u2019t have to be androgynous or genderless. These clothes had that code in place; satin dressing-room bombers over bare, muscled chests, or cropped boxy shirts as tops, worn with the aforementioned denim. In some ways, you could see hints of what the men wear on the current hit TV show Pose, though that program takes place a few years earlier than the \u201990s. But the look, and its progression, absolutely resonates now.

That has made it tough for brands like Landlord, which rode the initial wave of demand for outsize apparel, to chart its way forward. Designer Ryohei Kawanishi certainly does not lack for talent, but his New York\u2013based label has struggled to expand beyond its niche. This season, he toyed with the idea of a prima-donna athlete by twisting basketball jerseys, baseball jackets, and other sportswear with high-fashion dress codes; think hoodies and shorts cut from a cream boucl\u00e9 tweed. The knitwear felt strong, particularly an off-white sweater with bright pink and green trim and a cute graphic riff on a player\u2019s jersey number, while the plaid and military pant sets continued to demonstrate Kawanishi\u2019s skill for playful cut. Yet despite the exaggerated proportions and color, it didn\u2019t feel particularly editorial nor did it seem too commercial. It was as though he had tried to hit both marks at once and didn\u2019t quite make the target. One might credit some of that dissonance to the lookbook\u2019s styling, which appeals to Landlord\u2019s existing fanbase, but has not evolved as it needs to.

I\u2019m not proud to admit that for me, it meant several days between seeing the Ovadia & Sons Spring 2020 collection and sitting down to write this review, which is just enough time for the brand to be accused of copycatting styling ideas from Virgil Abloh and Prada. Reached through his public relations representative, Ariel Ovadia had this to say: \u201cAs pointed out in their caption, our looks were not similar. The styling comparison was coincidental. We style the clothes the way we personally wear them.\u201d The Ovadia brand, born from the designer and his twin Shimon\u2019s lifelong fashion obsession, has always been trendy. Instead of moving the needle on how men dress, this is a label that does well by participating in a dialogue about men\u2019s current crazes. As camp shirts rise in popularity and men opt to take fashion risks in florals and shocking pink, well, Ovadia & Sons will make those items to feed that market. For Spring 2020 they have collaborated with a trio of artists\u2014Jeff Palleiko, Stanley Mouse, and Wendy Hollender\u2014on custom prints to make those shirts a little more special. The reason for these artist collaborations, and the general ethereality of the collection, is that the pair have built their line around the happenings of each of the seven days of creation. Each day, from the creation of land and water to the birth of animals, is represented in the collection in some way. With Garden of Eden\u2013fruit shirts and ark-worthy animal processionals, it\u2019s not exactly subtle, but it\u2019s also not gimmicky, even considering that wizard intarsia sweater (a miraculous feat of construction that took their knitwear designer more than two weeks to create). As always with the Ovadia brothers, attention to detail and craftsmanship are tantamount. Every seam and stitch are considered, like the small notch at the back belt of a straight-leg pant or the new logo they\u2019ve developed, inspired by a death-metal band. They have put equal thought into their materials, finding new ways to garment-dye nylon on a speckled anorak and, in a collaboration with the Albert Einstein Institution, construct an embroidered portrait of the scientist made out of 22,000 individual stitches. It\u2019s this marriage of art and science that makes this brand stand apart from other hyped-up menswear labels. Their latest convert is J Balvin, this summer\u2019s most omnipresent Latinx music star, proving Ovadia appeal goes well beyond the regular temples of fashion."}, {"Designer": "Kozaburo", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Exactly two years have passed since Kozaburo Akasaka won the LVMH Special Prize on the strength of his first two collections.

There exists a kinship between his emotive designs and the spiritual connections embedded in the large-scale works of Michael Heizer, Robert Smithson, and Harvey Fite, whose Opus 40 environmental sculpture park in the Hudson Valley provided the backdrop for Spring 2020. Akasaka swept himself into a fantasy: \u201cThis is my wardrobe, if I was a landscape artist.\u201d (As if to playfully underscore that point, he also served as the lookbook\u2019s model.) He introduced a touch of sportswear\u2014a few well-cut tracksuits, nylon shorts, and anoraks\u2014but a land artist\u2019s sensitivity toward the environment led him to choose part-recycled synthetics, as well as a blend of organic cotton and recycled polyester for his T-shirts. Another smart bit of upcycling came through in his use of Kaya, a homespun hemp fabric historically used in Japan for mosquito nets. He used four layers of the stuff to create a thick, cottony cream gauze collared shirt that went well with summer-friendly versions of his signature suits, which came in featherweight linens, rodeo twill, and waffle-knit denim. Key graphics included an imaginary map titled \u201cLand of Setting Sun\u201d and the face of an Umibozu, or sea-bound spirit, embroidered on the back of a silk souvenir jacket as if to say, with excitement, uncharted waters lie ahead in Akasaka\u2019s brave new world."}, {"Designer": "Engineered Garments", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "At Engineered Garments, Daiki Suzuki has both the best materials and the best production\u2014but it\u2019s not enough for the menswear icon to simply rely on quality.

The updates are so small they wouldn\u2019t register to the untrained eye: say, a spread collar instead of a tab collar or a wabash stripe instead of a railroad one. But this closer-than-close attention to every element of clothing is what makes Engineered Garments so coveted by menswear obsessives. For Spring 2020, Suzuki and co. have underwritten their functionalism with a bit of French esprit. The blue of France\u2019s famous workwear jackets appears throughout, as does a new five-pocket jean style with a wide thigh and slight taper to the leg that is an homage to Fran\u00e7ois Girbaud. Elsewhere a handmade cotton boucl\u00e9 jacket with double pockets is a nod to Coco Chanel, bien sur. But these are the most literal examples of Suzuki\u2019s Gallic references. A hibiscus Hawaiian print appears on cotton; a random, all-over Madras runs through the shirting; and there is, of course, lots of Engineered Garments\u2019s universally beloved ripstop separates and cargo pants.

A painting within a painting, in a field.

It was a tented village over the brow of the hill, in soaring heat. \u201cEverything that means everything to me is from here. Please don\u2019t call me Parisian! I am from the South of France.\u201d His show happened to round off the European menswear season, but this was a one-shot Jacquemus show for Spring 2020; he won\u2019t be participating in the September Paris women\u2019s season. Who cares? This is by far the best way to see Jacquemus and all it\u2019s become\u2014a preternaturally mature brand with signatures and quirks all its own. There they were, parading through the lavender\u2014great loose, tailored suits that could work on anyone (like the blue-and-white scribbly flower-printed version); hyper-sexy modern peasant dresses with ribbon straps to tie and untie; sheer knits; the art-heel shoes he\u2019s invented; and the funny proportions of bags, from a shoulder tote as big as a tent to a \u201cgranny\u2019s cake-tin\u201d dangling from straps. It was the first time he\u2019s shown menswear with womens, and you could see the points\u2014all the squared-off printed shirts and canvas jackets\u2014where the clothes could easily be shared. How was it, thinking about both together? \u201cIt was so much easier and a big pleasure for the whole studio,\u201d he said. \u201cThe women gave so much to the men, and the men to women. But I always do things without trying too hard.\u201d So much of the conversation of the past few weeks has been about the escape from dystopian angst, the return to childhood, and the longing for youthful fun. Well Jacquemus doesn\u2019t need to theorize or theme around any of that; his brand genuinely is it: youth, sexiness, fun, and optimism bottled. Sales, he says, are soaring.

Aside from the fact that Rothko\u2019s murals never made the walls of the restaurant, none of the earnest and perfectly nice Boglioli crew I cornered mentioned any of this flimflam until I brought it up after a long conversation about the big push they had been making into softening silhouettes and garment dyeing. The clothes themselves were pleasing enough, sometimes beautiful, and consistently Boglioli-ian, but we were in the middle of a three-floor pavilion jammed with hundreds of different Italian menswear houses\u2014and outside there were more pavilions with thousands of brands from around the world. Perhaps the time spent here could have resulted in an epiphany over a previously unseen designer (exploring new houses is the great joy of Pitti) who had more substance than the fiction on the wall. Boglioli has just struck a new deal to outfit AC Milan, which is a strong statement in the domestic Italian market. Maybe the brand should focus on tweaking its fine clothes and working on this more straightforward form of messaging than chucking random rhetoric at a wall, then hoping we\u2019ll swallow it after its several-year period pushing a runway format in Milan that in the end\u2014just like the Four Seasons Rothko nod\u2014never bore the fruit it was supposed to."}, {"Designer": "Alyx", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Matthew Williams of 1017 Alyx 9SM (his brand\u2019s full name) didn\u2019t seem to attach much meaning to his venue\u2014a stunning, modernized bank building\u2014yet two words projected loud and clear: big and business.

Slimane (born 1968) and Kramer (born 1963) are soul mates, doomed to be eternally pissed that they were born fractionally too late to experience the rock-and-roll hedonism of the early \u201970s. They didn\u2019t get to swagger high-waist flares and dandified Savile Row tailored suits; to go backstage around the Stones when they were heading hippie in \u201967; to seriously don panamas and grow their hair long\u2014when all that was damned new and cool. The return to boyhood dreams has been a recurring theme in the menswear collections this season. The connection Slimane made with Kramer\u2019s work revealingly tied it all back into that same thing. He laid it all out for a new generation in the repertoire of high-hoicked, butt-clinching boot-cut pants and jeans, tiny bomber jackets, and all the minutely observed retailored throwbacks to rock-aristocracy style he marched out on the Celine runway. Slimane made no concessions in the way he showed it. There was no variance on his long-established method of plunging his audience into darkness, the grand installation at the beginning\u2014in this case, a boy in a silver glitter three-piece suit, transported on a rolling throne of a thing, surmounted by disco lights. Fashion theme, rinsed and systematized as accessible product\u2014in this case, aviators, pointy woven-leather Chelsea boots, and skinny ties\u2014is Slimane\u2019s claim on commercial dominance. It can seem emotionless, this method\u2014his way or the highway. It will also inevitably catch criticism for his casting\u2014there were only three black models on what appeared to be an otherwise all-Caucasian runway. The music scene never looked like that in the \u201970s, and it certainly does not today. That lack of diversity might be a preventative to this Celine collection speaking as widely as it could across today\u2019s generation. The collection checked many boxes, registering that proto-hippy moment when white kids began to travel, picking up peasant baskets and hanging out in North Africa\u2014the splendid gold-embroidered burnoose cape at the finale chimed in with a lot of other collections this season. Bringing up this era undoubtedly has resonance for a young generation who\u2019s definitely not been born into fun times; Slimane\u2019s right about that.

As he recalled backstage, on his first buying trip to New York in 1974, he and his partner, Pauline, stayed in Soho, where they trawled Pearl Paint and galleries including Pace and OK Harris. This was back when Soho was a Loft Law\u2013protected artist\u2019s paradise. An exhibition Smith caught on Dover Street recently rekindled his memories of that trip and formed the basis of a collection in which he worked to collage many Paul Smith\u2013ish elements to offer a fresh perspective via an eye so seasoned it witnessed YSL couture back in 1968. My standout piece was the billow-pocket, three-button jacket, with a high waist, that was part arty garm, part officer\u2019s battle dress.

The double-breasted was expanded to outerwear proportions, and in leather worn over three-button single-breasteds below. The colors ran the gamut from navy (a cool slim suit with zipper pockets on the pant leg in nylon) to pink (a leather pant you\u2019d need to be 25 and rich to buy but would have a lot of fun wearing) and were often coordinated with chisel-toe Chelsea boots. Drawstring slouch bags worn cross-body created interesting abstract floral shapes against pinstripe synthetics. T-shirts in shirting stripes were printed with abstract photo-realist-inspired reliefs.

Under V\u00e9ronique Nichanian, a designer whose term and output exemplifies the values of Herm\u00e8s, the silhouette of her pant is acutely considered and changes in carefully incremental shifts. This season saw her extend her slow and mindful exhalation toward a wider silhouette that was tonight sweetly commensurate with the soft breeze that aired our outside aspect. The fuller Herm\u00e8s profile au sud was paired au nord with a carefully sculpted masculine escarpment whose pinnacles were defined by a drawstring-laced popped collar imported to shirting from the half-zip pullover cagoule. This little drawstring motif was so small yet so consistently applied it became a sort of herbally accented flavor for the entire collection, until the sudden shift communicated by handsome foulard patch T-shirts and jackets, unbelievably almost the first time Nichanian has allowed herself to be not at all fou and remind Versace and all the rest who did it first by going the full foulard. The pieces were, frankly, all wonderful and presented in a rich ice cream palette. The consideration of complementarity in the color accents of knitwear against check was quietly masterful if hard to reproduce without full-look purchase. Backstage afterward, Nichanian talked about the reversible versatility of many of the pieces and ceded that streetwear has inflected her work\u2019s recent discernible casualization.

Scheduled after Loewe and before Thom Browne, Lak presented both the men\u2019s Fall capsule, now available to buy; the new Spring collection; plus some womenswear\u2014and if you didn\u2019t know any better, you\u2019d assume Sies Marjan has been on the Paris calendar all along. \u201cThere\u2019s an elevation and tougher competitive spirit in Paris; but in the end, I was just thinking about what is the best work I can make\u2014the most beautiful version of whatever it is I\u2019m trying to translate,\u201d he said, with impressive composure. That \u201cwhatever\u201d was expressed by Erykah Badu\u2019s \u201cI Want You,\u201d an extra-long track from 2003 that oozes anxious longing and intensifying soul. It could also be felt in rounded expanses of male d\u00e9collet\u00e9, outerwear spanning skin tones, knitwear underpinnings and tied waists that could be undone with a single pull. That \u201cwhatever\u201d was Lak addressing male sexuality in a highly nuanced way. \u201cWhat can you show of the male body that isn\u2019t necessarily porn or sex or gay or straight?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s this idea of nudity while fully dressed.\u201d In parallel, though, he also seemed determined to give the pieces a more elevated positioning. Chromatic leather jackets\u2014some embossed with a croc effect\u2014unstructured trench coats in deep hues, and sensuous constructions of silk not unlike his women\u2019s designs got this point across. Lak, in any case, wasn\u2019t making a radical statement for this coming out so much as a deeply personal one. \u201cI put everything into my work, and it\u2019s about having to expose yourself.\u201d It\u2019s rare to hear a designer discuss his or her own emotional vulnerability in the moments before or after a show; and yet this is what gives Sies Marjan a resonance beyond his sumptuous explorations of texture or color."}, {"Designer": "Kolor", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "There was an engaging flavor of dad clothes ripped asunder and then recombined by an inventive mind to suit the roll of a new generation in this strong Kolor menswear collection, which was shot in Tokyo.

Discussing men\u2019s as we raided his rail, Junichi Abe said: \u201cThis time I used lots of traditional images, like tailored jackets, chesterfield coats, and traditional checks, but using them to become pop garments.\u201d He also mentioned Giorgio Armani, a resurgent reference across several collections this season, and something you could see in Abe\u2019s mashed-up, loose-armhole jackets and coats. One crispy nylon olive trench with a perforated orange lining stood out especially to this browser, but from the technical-twisted slides and bags made of shining malleable jersey under aluminum under vinyl to the chopped-up check dad-gone-mad jacketing and spliced-up trousers, there was lots here to dig into. For the women's spring collection, mumsy prettiness rather than dusty dadness was the grain sent through Abe\u2019s creative mill before being baked into fresh shapes. These included a fine long handkerchief-print silk dress iced with a narrow belt and melded to a gold-threaded knit, a loose black mesh top above a skirt in clever croc-pattern-pressed red nylon, and a many-patched dress whose skirt was a shimmering skein of metallic finished check.

They were just one small part of a theatrical runway fantasy, in which Browne\u2014recast as Monsieur Brun in his show notes\u2014imagined himself as a host at what he called a Versailles country club. Playing Brun was no less than James Whiteside, one of American Ballet Theatre\u2019s principal dancers, who emerged palely powdered with ceruse and tricolor blue bee-stung lips, wearing a high-cut seersucker tutu. He cut a marvelous swath as he prepared for his garden party. This involved overseeing the preparation of 10 \u201cstatues,\u201d which were in fact 10 very game models clad in horizontally enormous 2-D trompe l\u2019oeil renderings of the 3-D outfits worn beneath them, which were short suits in various shades of seersucker accessorized with seersucker footballs, basketballs, and baseballs. They were shod in black and white brogued basketballs topped by pulled-high mismatched sport socks. Their outfits were revealed by attendants in sport shorts, pointy-toe corespondent shoes, and Browne-skinny jackets whose skirts barely brushed the matching codpiece/jockstrap also worn below. All this, mind you, before the first look of the collection. Browne\u2019s guests strode onto his metaphorical lawn with more corespondents, these with a curved 2 inches or so exposed inset heel that elevated the ball of the foot above the flat sole beneath it. The outfits, like the latticed football helmet worn by one of the attendants, made lavish use of the wide-to-each-side silhouette created by Marie Antoinette\u2013era pannier dresses. In the pieces adorned with prep-staple marine patching there was another irony in the fashion interplay of whale and whalebone (happily, though, no whale tail). Against that broadening ying tugged the narrowing yang of corsetry, from which were suspended literally drop-waist skirts. Pretty much everything was seersucker, sometimes patched, sometimes fringed, sometimes embroidered\u2014but always seersucker. The American tradition of men\u2019s dress from which Browne mines his material is via Ivy League, rooted in sport, and here there were sportif accessories galore: basketball bags, soccer ball bags, football bags\u2014a lot of ball bags, basically. Some of the seersucker panniers worn on the shoulder lent a prettily garlanded, football-echoing bulk to the form within, and one exposed pannier skirt featured seersucker balls that rested between it and either side of the wearer\u2019s hip. Browne is a highly popular designer among professional sports players, of course, and he explained today\u2019s play thus: \u201cI\u2019ve always use sports as a reference, and today, playing with the severity of the 18th-century reference, grounding it in sports, was a way to bring it into the men\u2019s world.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Isabel Marant", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "During these most recent fashion weeks in Milan and Paris, Isabel Marant hosted two big parties\u2014to celebrate her new Italian flagship and to break ground on her first dedicated men\u2019s boutique in the Marais. Judging from photos, both looked exactly how you\u2019d imagine an Isabel Marant party to look: effortlessly stylish people not taking themselves too seriously. Days later from her Paris showroom, bustling with buyers, she seemed amused by so much socializing within such a short time, admitting that the buzz had its benefits. \u201cI\u2019m not out much and I don\u2019t really share my private life, so when we organize these parties, of course it helps to better understand the brand,\u201d she said. Or, at least, to create an experience around it in the absence of a men\u2019s show. Among the best discoveries this season: a blouson in Prince of Wales suit fabric; watercolor-blocked sweaters; embroidered denim; and a slim, printed jumpsuit. Without trying, the majority of these looks aligned with the continuing shift toward a gentler masculinity, which Marant chalked up to the ongoing influence of her womenswear (specifically, the \u00c9toile range). Look no further than the quilt jacket (not to be confused with quilted) or the slouchy cable knits that are now brand standbys across both categories. As she sees it, though, the menswear should remain within a certain relatable register. \u201cWhat I offer is super wearable, not too complicated,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no pretensions of proposing high fashion.\u201d While this steadiness is surely appreciated by guys who are buying into the brand on a regular basis, she likely has more leeway to shake things up than she realizes.

You could guess pretty well how his djellaba-clad procession of wanderers had reached that blissed-out plane. The first model, wearing a kind of white smock-shirt and wide cotton trousers, had a metal disc pendant on a leather thong strung around his neck and a couple of what looked like party favors, sprouting feathers, tucked behind each ear. Later on, another had strapped the same disc\u2014which had a hole in its center\u2014around his forehead. A portal into the mind, perhaps\u2014a third eye. The symbolism resonated, because Anderson has created Loewe as a head culture all its own. It\u2019s a place where he\u2019s taken old hippie values\u2014for tuning into eclecticism and handmade crafts\u2014and levitated them as a 21st-century luxury-grade cult. The feeling in the room was palpable: His audience was made up of total converts to the entire trip and all its sensations\u2014the complete picture of layered textures, stripes, and colors, and especially the sight of ultrarefined suede, cut into caftans with matching trousers. An alternative suit, if ever there was one. Anderson free-associates when he talks about his work. He spoke of romanticism, youth, the spiritual value of fantasy: \u201cWe have to be aware of what\u2019s going on in the world, but sometimes it\u2019s good to dream. Why should people not be in a fantasy state? Maybe they\u2019ll find something.\u201d All emotionally true, perhaps, but Anderson is hardly a designer with his head in the clouds. His view of Loewe as a super-refined Spanish leather goods company is totally grounded in product. This collection, with its huge inventory of inventive knitwear, Roman sandals, moccasins, espadrille boots, slip-on leather shoes, and array of bags shows how far fashion desires have traveled from wanting to conform to mono trends. Anderson promises, instead, a store in which you can \u201cfind yourself\u201d\u2014that old hippie path to individualism, now leading to an irresistible shopping experience. There was a telling insight into Anderson\u2019s thinking at the end of his backstage briefing. \u201cObviously, Loewe\u2019s first really big moment was in the \u201970s,\u201d he remarked. That was before he was born, but the Anderson family spent their holidays in Ibiza\u2014a center of neo-hippie lifestyle to this day. His experiment in launching Paula\u2019s Ibiza as a Loewe sub-brand, spun out of thinking about the homemade market fare sold on the Balearic island, was kind of a test run to see how far he could go with artsy-craftsy casual bits and pieces.

But where the ambience at Vuitton played up the whimsy, tonight\u2019s Casablanca show shepherded people to the picturesque grounds of the Mus\u00e9e de Montmartre where, a century ago, artists lived, created, and caroused. Casablanca\u2019s founder, Charaf Tajer, happens to know a thing or two about hosting epic get-togethers, and within the museum\u2019s garden was a scene that felt transplanted from one of these. Now, though, two seasons into his brand, he said he was about plugging into the music of Jorge Ben and donning his designer hat. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do\u2014and it\u2019s a job,\u201d he said. \u201cI love applying my vision to things.\u201d And his vision is a fun one. Mostly it consists of rather lovely prints worn in a way that provokes immense swagger. Just check out Swae Lee, one half of the hip-hop duo Rae Sremmurd, who appeared second in the lineup dressed in a double-denim look drenched in hot pink and perfume bottles. Tajer confirmed that every animation\u2014from dragons to deserted islands, peeled oranges to swimming pools\u2014is created in-house. Pieces toggled between tropical leisure attire and put-together sportswear: spread-collar shirts open past the chest; retro-fitted trousers in Miami Beach hues; knitwear tracksuits. This was an ambitious collection, totaling 65 looks accessorized with day bags, suede loafers, and embroidered moccasins. The tailoring could have benefited from a bit more finesse\u2014or else have been dropped altogether for more of the embellished denim, which was gaudy in a good way. Whether Tajer was imagining certain archetypes\u2014off-duty soccer player, yacht-owning eccentric, dandyish millennial\u2014he was essentially recasting and convincing his crowd to embrace a wider range of style codes. Casablanca has arrived at a moment when people are wondering what comes after, or at least exists as a counterpoint to, streetwear. \u201cThere are two schools,\u201d Tajer said, using the French word, \u00e9cole. \u201cI think there is an \u00e9cole of cool and an \u00e9cole of beautiful.

Today is the solstice, of course, so perhaps that added an extra ley-line resonance to this GmbH-authored cut-in-cloth cult of diversely dreamy characters. As co-designer Benjamin Huseby explained as his partner Serhat Isik applied last-minute adjustments pre-show: \u201cWe have always talked about protection, but this time we wanted to make a gentler collection and focus on spiritual, or intellectual, protection.\u201d That means belief (whether ideological, religious, or pagan), and here Huseby and Isik looked to their cultural heritage\u2014Pakistani-Norwegian and Turkish-German, respectively\u2014and focused especially on the nazar, or amulet thought to protect one from the evil eye. Wearing an evil eye is a form of superstitious protection from misfortune at the hands of fate, and GmbH\u2019s models were heartily armored in beautiful brocade evil eye shirts, flowing many-eyed silk shirts and pants, T-shirts, and dresses. They were also bolstered by the silhouette-defining twists of strapping that encircled the waist on denim and suiting for men and women, which created gorgeously regal silhouettes. In addition, there were jackets with hammered silk strapping, like little shoulder holsters, that were also attractive. Some of the overlap-strap shoes and apparently leather goods were, in fact, made by an Italian supplier from apple pulp. This was an all-vegan show\u2014and the few synthetic pieces, including the kinky double-zipped sludgy brown pants or the open-zippered at-the-knee pants with matching shirts in olive and off-white, were as environmentally virtuous as the designers could make them.

Maybe a thousand or so people roared in reply, a human cacophony that indicated they thought it was very fucking amazing indeed. How clever of Olivier Rousteing\u2019s Balmain to lean into Paris\u2019s longest night, the summer solstice tradition of street drinking and live music to present this season\u2019s menswear (liberally sprinkled with womenswear) collection as a free show/concert. Criss had just finished a cover of Prince\u2019s \u201cKiss\u201d and was about to launch into Joe Dassin\u2019s \u201cChamps \u00c9lys\u00e9e\u201d when he asked his critical question. Shortly afterward, Rousteing shimmied out from backstage to belt out a verse via his signature sumptuous pout. Just before Criss opened tonight\u2019s musical entertainment, Rousteing led his models onstage, and it was fascinating to watch from our privileged wristband position the hundreds of arms raised in smartphone supplication towards him and them. Yes, this was a benefit gig from which all profits went to Bono\u2019s RED HIV-tackling charity (the margin-generating Parisian food and drink stalls on site smelled very good indeed), but the Insta-cloud of hashtagged positivity will surely be highly positive for Rousteing\u2019s brand. From our little raised gantry at the side of the stage in which tattooed rappers smoked weed and scowled in studied delight as sinuous model types shimmied thigh to thigh and moued with intent, it was pretty hard to see the clothes. Luckily a preview, with Rousteing in full flight, set us straight. There were some bananas biker jackets in mirrored PVC or embroidered cut transparent plastic and a lot of very strong slouchy tailoring\u2014I adored a draped double-breasted suit in black silk and the cut of built-in-cummerbunded pleated pants. Rousteing said he wanted to imagine the Balmain man (and woman) 50 or 60 years hence, which made sense. The trench-coat skirts for men were hilariously subversive (in a good way), especially when pastelized. A side note: It was so good to see Rousteing at the Off-White show earlier this week, because this snooty fashion world often overlooks what a catalyzingly powerful force he was\u2014before any other designer in Paris and way pre-Abloh\u2014in activating Paris fashion\u2019s delayed and, one suspects, systematically reluctant lurch to diversity. On the big screens to the side of the stage this evening it was signaled that ce soir was \u201cV01\u201d of this idea. Very good, and bad luck to the rest of you for not thinking of it first. This could be a great staple event for Balmain to run at June menswear, and\u2014when refined\u2014will suck the oxygen from other much more portentous and less adventurous concepts on the calendar.

In harmony with these cocreators, Li applied mixed-up fan patches to the back of biker shorts and starkly graphic white stenciling to the front of black suiting. There was a gothic Godflesh robelike parka and a hard-edged denim donkey jacket, a cool red-fringed black shirt and a typically tough KTC-produced trench, and a fine satin-lined double-faced fish-tail parka. The collection was entitled Greatest Hits (Side A), which suggests Li is going to move onto some B-side rarities and more remixes come next season.

Harder still for a men\u2019s designer like Kim Jones, because going back a few decades, the Dior reputation in menswear was simply that the house provided conventional gray suits, safe for middle-management upward. Jones, however, is 21st-century smart. He says he sees Christian Dior from the point of view of a very long-term legacy\u2014what history will record that he contributed to the house, in the future. Which is why he saw a connection with American artist Daniel Arsham, whose practice is imagining future archaeologies\u2014what people (if there are people by then) will make of the clues humans leave behind about our cultures and technologies centuries hence. Jones commissioned Arsham to make an installation of giant DIOR capital letters, crumbling cement sculptures situated amid serenely surreal pink desert sand. Above the entrance to the show was a faux clock, cracked and chipped; it was a reimagined replica of the one that Arsham and Jones saw in a photograph of Christian Dior in his office in the \u201950s\u2014the very same one is there today, ticking away the minutes as all of Jones\u2019s predecessors have come and gone. It gave him a conceptual landscape in which to place his own rediscovery of the Dior gray men\u2019s suit, once thought impervious to fashion and strictly separated in its 20th-century masculine gendered category, still a huge one for the brand. Jones, cleverly, has set about putting his own imprint on the business by continuing to place tailoring at its core\u2014not going so far as to scare off the existing customer, but by incrementally transferring flourishes and techniques from the women\u2019s couture side of the house. Last season, he unearthed the key to this Dior solution when he added a diagonal satin sash\u2014a memory of Christian Dior\u2019s haute couture\u2014to the template of the male suit. It has met with success, he says: \u201cPeople have been ordering them for weddings\u2014lots of men, women too. It\u2019s become a real business of its own.\u201d So he\u2019s continued developing that for summer, integrating the sash, normalizing it as more of a lapel detail or minimizing it as a cross-body drape that disappears into a jacket\u2019s side seam. The idea that Jones\u2019s new generation of Dior discoverers might belong to a team of desert archaeologists was lightly pursued. They wore calcified lily of the valley brooches. Relics left behind from John Galliano\u2019s time at the house had been rediscovered. His newspaper prints reappeared on shirts, and the shape of the Dior saddlebag, used in a bleached-out replica, was echoed in curved pocket-flap signifiers on backpacks. Jones clearly believes that 21st-century men see the rigid gendered binaries their fathers and grandfathers conformed to as a thing of the past. He sees millennials and Gen-Z customers in Los Angeles, New York, Shanghai, and Seoul ready to adopt toile de Jouy print jumpsuits or organza bombers, delicately embroidered with blue hand-pleated swirling patterns (Jones says he took that motif from Arsham\u2019s Japanese raked-sand installations). But he also intuits that these young guys see the classic template of the tailored suit with unprejudiced eyes. Jones\u2019s insight is that men\u2019s fashion at Dior can move forward by accessing the elegance of the past, wondering at the beauty of what can be discovered in the foundations. A sound way to construct a future."}, {"Designer": "Eytys", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Having built a solid foundation on shoes and jeans and dabbled in collaborations with the likes of H&M and others, cult Swedish brand Eytys is amping up its act.

Perhaps that\u2019s why she decided to accept an exciting commission from the Vienna State Opera to work on costumes for a new production of Orlando, by Olga Neuwirth. The idea is formidable: three great artistic women\u2019s imaginations\u2014Virginia Woolf, Olga Neuwirth, Rei Kawakubo\u2014converging on the idea of conveying a character\u2019s journey from one gender to the other. So serious is Kawakubo about it that she announced a plan: The next two of her shows are to be regarded as Acts I and II, the Vienna premiere in December 2019 being Act III. Ungendered, nonbinary design is a natural zone for Kawakubo\u2014arguably she\u2019s been in it all along. Today it comes over as far less of a transgression to see young men wearing \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d clothes\u2014in fact, the right to choose to wear dresses is the new normal for young people like Charles Jeffrey, whose work Kawakubo has supported from the start by buying his Loverboy collection for Dover Street Market. She\u2019d invited Jeffrey to see the Comme des Gar\u00e7ons Homme Plus show, Orlando Act I, in which she made free with arrays of ruffles, Edwardiana, frock coats, pinafores, petticoats, bishop\u2019s sleeves, and bloomers, shown on boys with marcel-waved bobbed wigs. It\u2019s never wise to second-guess Kawakubo, but the thought did cross the mind that she might be playing a trick on her audience by showing her women\u2019s collection in her men\u2019s slot, and vice versa for the upcoming show in September. But probably that\u2019s just old-think. Just as women have long been able to plunder the male wardrobe for tailoring and shirts, now boys and men have permission to choose blouses, skirts, corseted coats, quilted collarless jackets, pearl necklaces, and T-shirts printed with jewelry. Kawakubo, in her state of independence, has no one to answer to about which \u201cdepartment\u201d these clothes will be sold in. They\u2019ll answer the prayers of the new avant-garde dandy, and they\u2019ll probably attract plenty of women too. The clothes we wear should simply portray how we feel inside on that day.

Decoration as dissembling is a puritan notion, yet there is also a power in restraint, and apart from a few sparse brand graphics and a building print tee, this was indeed a collection uncluttered by surface chatter. This left you free to consider the handsome aspect of Taverniti\u2019s roomy raw-denim work jackets and jeans, and cotton drill pants cut extra-high at the waist. He went high, but he also went low, with what looked like treated silky nylon patched square-cut drop-crotch pants in white.

With an array of streetwise jumpsuits, the designer offered up a meditation on independence of spirit, as technology in general\u2014and AI in particular\u2014threatens to eclipse humans. On the runway that translated into mostly successful mash-ups of checks, prints, and loose pants with so many zippered pockets one could easily pass on ever carrying a bag.

This was a precise studding of what resembled small nailheads, applied to an oversized bomber and backpack and then a suit. It was inspired by Van Assche\u2019s observation that while at work in Berluti\u2019s Ferrara factory, the shoemakers often hold nails between their lips while attaching an upper to a sole. Said Van Assche: \u201cIt\u2019s just like when people in the atelier put the pins in their mouth\u2026and I was like, this [Ferrara] is really my atelier now. This know-how is usually under the surface\u2026but I wanted to put it on the outside and use it as an embellishment because it is such an inside part of the house.\u201d Van Assche again mixed tailoring with moto-inspired pieces to evoke the complementary interplay of heritage values and fashion-forwardness he is working to achieve. This was also exemplified in the orange-accent-soled Alessandro shoes and the orange piping on this season\u2019s bag offer. The color of the suiting, some of which included armless jackets and overcoats, or went Bermuda-formal, was a filtered-up, acidified, accentuated interpretation of the palette of dyes used at Berluti to give its footwear that famous rich patina. The house\u2019s scritto motif (the reproduction of a calligraphically expressive 19th-century manuscript transferred to leather)\u2014once hidden away from the Berluti show-sphere but long a popular category among customers for shoes and small leather goods\u2014was transferred to some of that suiting and other coats and suits tailored in leather.

Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Sanchez\u2019s breezy soundtrack blended Anne Clark\u2019s Elegy for a Lost Summer with breathy dialogue from Alphaville to build a beguiling sonic parure at this sometimes beautiful but always Berluti-ful show."}, {"Designer": "Jil Sander", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The Jil Sander invitation was accompanied by a sachet filled with what looked like large chocolate truffles (chocolate being this reviewer\u2019s Fashion Week sustenance), but were actually \u201cseed bombs.\u201d Once they are watered, whether in a pot or the ground, these hunks of natural bounty will almost immediately begin sprouting.

After two years of them designing together, we are continuing to see what this entails. In suiting terms, they fine-tuned silhouettes so that they appeared noticeably constructed without appearing heavy or stiff. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to build things,\u201d Luke explained. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sacrifice volume in the spring because of weight or because of warmth.\u201d Accordingly, they proposed shirts as strong standalone pieces, then shifted to lighter, looser layers. And it was pleasing to see the expected emphasis on black and ivory give way to an International Klein blue caftan here, a glossy chocolate leather coat there. There were noticeable subtractions (the frequent absence of lapels) balanced by unexpected additions (straps encircling upper arms; a raffia-like crossbody sash worn under a jacket). And there were decadent fringes extending down the sides of knits, often trailing along the ground, which Lucie explained as a display of poetry. Would they remain so long? \u201cWe\u2019re going to figure that out,\u201d said Luke, to which Lucie added that they could be cut as needed. It must have taken some out-of-box thinking to arrive at the boxy, color-blocked bags, which were eye-catching but not as instantly desirable as the big bicolor totes. In fact, while watching the footwear alternate between barely-there moccasins and sturdy-soled boots, a thought occurred that the couple had planted many ideas here, aware that some would capture attention while others might go unnoticed. Printed on the backs of certain looks, for example, was a delicate plant clipping enlarged exponentially beyond its actual size.

A scary character walking in with the \u201cpolice\u201d was wearing a shirt, a tie stamped with a Global Mind Fuck logo, a conference sticker reading \u201cHello I am Capitalism,\u201d and a MAGA cap. Wait, no, a red baseball cap with For Rent embroidered on it. Rent? Large For Rent signs appeared on the backs of jackets, too. What did that signify? All the things you can imagine when you see it, about the desperation of a generation willing to do anything to get paid or the hollowed-out husks of men with no moral scruples about moving capital around.

He\u2019d brought in a florist to decorate a jute harness and the inner brims of straw hats with fresh flowers. It didn\u2019t read as a naive, bucolic narrative so much as one of this season\u2019s connection points between popular handmade craft and the work of the skilled people who work at luxury goods houses. \u201cThere is an atelier here with 24 sewers, and that\u2019s what makes it different,\u201d Abloh observed. You sensed his relish in cultivating super-sophisticated effects, like flower embroideries climbing up tulle coats, and a couple of immensely luxe iterations of hoodies, made from minutely pleated chiffon. \u201cI\u2019m learning, and taking much more of a couture approach.\u201d Abloh is the fulcrum point of these changing times in fashion, creating common ground between the aesthetics of the cultures of streetwear and the exclusive domain of luxury.

Her Florentine apartment, ensconced in a noble palazzo in the heart of the old city, boasts a magnificent secret garden, lush with century-old trees overlooking an ancient monastery and a church.

He has a penchant for a decadent Renaissance mood and favors opulence of fabrications and flamboyant yet elegant silhouettes, which he undercuts with irreverence and a flair for subversion. His signature robes de chambre in silk satin were worn over denim and with combat boots, and strict British-inspired tailoring was smoothed with almost feminine accents, as in ribbon belts cinching the waists of elongated blazers. Slender suits were given a sensuous finish via sumptuous mauve silk moir\u00e9, while a Prince of Wales jacquard suit was printed with red tigers and esoteric symbols. A little homage to Vivienne Westwood never hurts.

He drew inspiration from his 25-year-old parakeet, Tommaso, the presentation\u2019s guest of honor, whose colorful plumage was reproduced as a painterly print on a denim jacket and matching pants, or on a liquid silk robe coat, worn with a pale blue metallic leather biker.

This is why the several tons of damp clay taken from the L.A. studio of British artist Thomas Houseago\u2014who has a statue currently installed in the center of the Palais de Tokyo courtyard as part of his \u201cAlmost Human\u201d show at the Musee de l\u2019Art Moderne\u2014made for such a fitting addition to this show\u2019s mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. Houseago, Owens reported, had been on set to oversee the installation of the clay and even ended up creating a small sculpture (one that Owens fully intended to pinch, fire, and add to his collection). Houseago was just one in a chorus of creative voices that harmonized around this collection. Although there were some very overtly personal and Mexican touches, such as sequins reflecting China Poblana festival wear and the Aztec Eagle logo of the United Farm Workers\u2019 association, for whose Mexican migrant pickers Owens\u2019s father often worked as a translator in the California courts (these garments and a piece of jewelry will be sold to benefit the UFW), he said he was very careful to avoid the folkloric side of Mexican culture. Instead, he said, he had become fascinated with the effect of Mexican culture on the work of Josef and Anni Albers, the subject of a recent-ish show at the Guggenheim. Owens expounded: \u201cI loved that combination of modernism with something so ancient. Looking at the drawings they made that were inspired by the sites was the Mexico angle I wanted.\u201d With the exception of some Perspex-heeled platforms and rough tire-sole cowskin sandals that caused much trepidation as the models descended steps while keeping their eyes fixed on the pit, it was also a collection abrim with highly wearable pieces. Personally I loved the cotton jackets in black and white set with austere, angled grids of ribbon and lacing, which was sometimes reflected in a riot of lacing on a Veja collab sneaker and looped into the fabric of some loose wool track pants. The sequins incorporated one-color oversize tailoring and looked pleasingly sleazy, while metallic-finished outerwear boasted a brutal industrial shimmer. In collaboration with Champion, Owens primitivized its cotton jersey via transformation into togas and loincloths. Zippered jumpsuits, some half-worn to optimize ab exposure, looked toughly utilitarian, while short-hemmed tailored jackets in white snakeskin over low-neck loose T-shirts and white sequined zippered pants appeared twistedly slick\u2014especially when teamed with a pompadour. According to Josef Albers, \u201cin art, tradition is to create, not to revive,\u201d and in this highly artful collection we saw an outstanding expression of the tradition in clothing created by Owens."}, {"Designer": "Siki Im", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Mobile Suit Gundam, William Gibson\u2019s Neuromancer, Jedi, Wall-E, and \u201cRidley Scott color-blocking\u201d: these were just a few of the references dropped by Siki Im as we scanned this collection from orbit.

When things are too serious, it\u2019s boring\u2026so I wanted to bring fun though color and through revisiting British culture through my Italian eyes, and to work via an incredible inspiration as David Hockney is, both as an icon of style and an artist.\u201d Hockney has many fans in fashion\u2014Michael Kors, Christopher Bailey at Burberry, Jacquemus, JW Anderson, Fendi, Olympia Le-Tan, Paul Smith, Preen by Thornton Bregazzi, Ellery, and John Galliano are just a few labels that have also used his verve and art as inspiration for collections. And in September 2008 Clare Waight Keller dedicated a collection of womenswear to a bigger splash for no lesser house than Pringle of Scotland. That made it difficult for Marretta to find much fresh water. For instance, we\u2019d seen the pool-dappled pattern\u2014which is very attractive\u2014not just at Kors\u2019s Hockney-hashing collection, but also this season at MSGM (in a collection simply enough about summer). Yet that\u2019s not to conclude this was an altogether poor debut from Marretta, who clearly has some serious knitwear petrol in his engine following his time in Milan. The double-face wool-blend track pants and rib-knit sweaters in violently opposing lifeguard-uniform yellow and red were, as he said, fun. So were his pieces of reversible outerwear in checks that mashed Prince of Wales against argyle, which matched his a-lot-like-Birkenstock sandals. The intarsia-homage diving-figure sweater was cute.

Escapism in fashion can sometimes lead to dubious and dark places. Not so, with Piccioli, whose positivism is inclusive\u2014the diverse casting he\u2019s brought to his women\u2019s shows carried through to men\u2014and comes from lived experience.

He was on what was once thought of as the fringe. . . . but now, through time, we can see that the beauty of Basquiat is also the beauty of Lenny, Futura.\u201d That transition from the counterculture\u2014the fringe\u2014to become both the subject of establishment acclaim and an agent of change within the establishment mirrors Abloh\u2019s own path: In the 10 years since he was photographed by Tommy Ton with Kanye West and crew outside Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Abloh has completed the full loop. But reflecting on the longer span of Futura\u2019s journey\u2014combined with his own recent project curating his past body of work for the \u201cFigures of Speech\u201d exhibition in Chicago\u2014has made Abloh consider a bigger picture. \u201cWhen I make things, I look at it on a scale of 30 years. What gives the esteem and the energy . . . I know the work has to mean something now, but I\u2019m also thinking about what it means when you zoom out.\u201d There was certainly a sense of space in time in some of this collection. Its span of reference was broad but as legibly interconnected as the branding on the new Nike Dunk, codesigned with Futura, that made its debut on Abloh\u2019s carnation-field runway. The chain-link fence pattern on bags, jackets, and a semitransparent poncho played nicely against the densely hand-knit sweaters that bore patches declaring membership in the \u201cOff-White climbing club.\u201d Climbing was not only this collection\u2019s second big theme\u2014reflected in the drawstrings worked into suiting, the technical luggage, and the nylon patched knit faux fleeces\u2014but it was also part of the broader metaphor at play. A sky blue suede trench with detachable front pockets, a double-layered floral-print down jacket and shorts, a chain-link knit off-white shirt and shorts, plus the recut denim template workwear in washed and treated technical fabrics were all highly polished and finished pieces. Conversely, the tie-dyed cargo pants (sometimes crystal set) and denim, the bandana-patched T-shirts, those dense knit sweaters, and bleached flannel shirting were all designed to appear roughened and weathered. In a piece of tape played before the show, Bjork spoke about the \u201cspaced-outness\u201d of perspective, nurtured through the landscape of Iceland, that helped her learn songwriting. Abloh seems to be in search of a similar panoramic point of view\u2014an apex position\u2014and the topography of the clothes he is producing as he makes that ascent is benefiting from it."}, {"Designer": "Ami", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "When a crowd of hundreds gathers and quietly swelters while waiting for a show in the Grand Palais on a June afternoon, you get the sense a designer has something up his sleeve. Which, in fact, Alexandre Mattiussi does. He sports on his forearm a tattoo of a Roman numeral\u2014IX. Nine. It\u2019s his lucky number. It so happens the numerology is working in his favor. The designer has moved into his ninth year as a Parisian indie. Today, June 18, marked his 18th show, which squares nicely. And, conveniently enough, the French word for \u201cnine\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d is one and the same. One cycle ends, another begins. Mattiussi champions fashion with a sense of humility. Back in the day, he resigned from a major fashion house and struck out on his own because he could not reconcile with designing menswear that was too far removed from real-world dressing. ANDAM Prize in hand, he staked out a place in men\u2019s ready-to-wear with AMI. Elevated basics like easy overcoats and cropped carrot pants were just edgy enough for a broad Parisian base. It made a whole lot of sense. Women were known to adopt the outerwear, and style icons like Caroline de Maigret walked in his shows (she sat front row wearing a caramel AMI ensemble tonight). For years, the designer\u2019s women friends needled him to branch out. \u201cI always wanted to be a small house with a lot of humility,\u201d the designer said this evening. Today, he chose to push AMI into new, slightly darker and moodier territory, complete with a full-fledged women\u2019s category\u2014without blurring gender lines. In a crisp palette of black, white, beige, and poppy red with the occasional shot of fuchsia, Mattiussi stepped neatly into a space that, bizarrely, has sat relatively unoccupied in the Parisian landscape for years, ever since a few international behemoths (and a smattering of niche brands) got big enough to lose the plot. \u201cSuddenly Next Summer,\u201d as the collection was called, sticks with Parisian essentials: a sharp trench with a wide belt (one of them in black leather); a cropped jacket, also with a wide belt; a mean pair of pants; a sharp, sleeveless coat; a black-and-white check jacket. The meditation bells on a coat or shoes may not be for everyone, but they speak to the designer\u2019s sense of staying centered. \u201cI wanted to do pretty and sophisticated ready-to-wear,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people are cool; I wanted to show something more of Paris.\u201d That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean starting a revolution.

The collection seemed to be a kind of imaginative boyhood view of tropes of uniform\u2014the clothes that authority figures wear\u2014all mussed up by a purposely blurred focus. There was a heavily gestalt feeling at play, yet the parts that made up the sum were in fact the meat and potatoes of this richly blended stew of auto-referential menswear. This was a collection based upon the aspirations of manhood we aspire to when immature, eroded by the knowledge gained through maturity. It was about lost love\u2014love squandered\u2014and idiocy. Yes, it was also about a collaboration with Converse that introduced a new pimp-soled postmodern expression of Chuck. The collection was called Duet, but it was really a series of duets between Miyashita and his references. Between them they created a handsome, soaring chorus in which the disappointment inherent in aspiring to fit into the uniform of masculine codes, and then falling short of their impossible standards, hung long and slow in the air.

But if you look at nature, you will see all of these colors together, and they work very well.\u201d That was the starting point of a collection that made a point of allowing nature to be the architect of much of the color palette. Ganryu said he\u2019s a freak for National Geographic\u2019s Instagram feed, and with his assistants he assembled a huge shortlist of sky images, seascapes, star-scapes, and forest canopy images from which to create the prints for the opening section of garments. Unless outerwear, these looks placed the sky images above the waist and the earth-level imagery below. With the exception of the first of two hugely oversize duffle coats\u2014whose construction was inspired by that of the kimono, but which also created a complete-with-cincture monk\u2019s habit effect\u2014these pieces were relatively orthodox backdrops for his prints. Then, after a striped intermission, Ganryu returned with a section that slightly reminded of old-school Benetton campaigns in their adjacency of intensely colored, apparently mundane garments (which close inspection revealed were made in beautifully finished cotton and nylons). Finally, via a great \u201ctrench coat robe\u201d wonderfully slashed on the left side for insouciant swooshing, the sun slowly set via some gray-to-black suiting featuring super-volumized pants and attractive box-pleat jackets.

Design director Stefano Gaudioso Tramonte had even cut down on the carbon impact of this presentation (and model transportation costs) by quick-changing back and forth garments including a fine 100% GOTS-certified organic cotton white bomber, teamed on the mannequin with some handsome European-tailored pants in flax and a sneaker with a flax upper and recycled polyester-inserted sole. Tramonte conceded that this new Circle initiative\u2014that will see all of the garments on offer presented with a full-disclosure set of information about their provenance\u2014is only a first step, but seemed committed to it. He was also typically engaging about the rest of a non-Circle offer\u2014you can\u2019t rebuild Rome in a day\u2014that featured suits, of course, as well as a lot of highly covetable, volumized hybrid pieces that mixed impeccable fabrication with military or casual design touches."}, {"Designer": "Heron Preston", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Swamped by admirers post-show, Heron Preston was asked about the words highs and lows written below his name and that of the season.

This collection is based on big-city life.\u201d Fittingly, this was a show crowded with a broad range of collaborative fellow citizens. In partnership with Los Angeles\u2013based Sami Miro there was an upcycled capsule entitled Natural Disaster (brave name) that included a strongly waisted denim dress and organza-like boob tube. Levi\u2019s pitched in with a collaboration entitled Mistakes Are OK (another brave name), in which Preston worked to subvert the codes of the venerable denim brand by misplacing pockets, belt loops, and buttons. The opening suit in quilted white Tyvek was produced in partnership with the architecture practice Dattner, and the artist Robert Nava lent an angel painting that was reproduced on hoodies, denim, T-shirts and a blazer. Plus there was Gore-Tex-treated outerwear (liberally branded with Gore-Tex technical signifiers) in recycled polyester. The unwelcome whale-tail sighting in womenswear apart\u2014seriously, are we going there again?\u2014this was a neatly assembled all-life-is-here cross section of citywear, running from bombers and field jackets in orange nylon cut in with boucl\u00e9 to bright loose suiting (including a great yellow-cab print on a women\u2019s short suit) and plenty of black nylon pieces that looked collaborative in spirit too. Nava\u2019s illustrations lent an engaging energy to the pieces upon which they were applied, and smokily deconstructed shades of gray camouflage looked good in menswear.

It took place in a proper, peaceful part of the 16th arrondissement inside a grand townhouse recently vacated by the Netherlands delegation of the OECD. These particulars help underscore the huge geographic and cognitive leap from her deliberately homespun presentations in downtown New York. The leap gets larger still when factoring in the time she spent researching this collection at the Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida. The circus storyline that emerged wasn\u2019t arbitrary\u2014and it certainly wasn\u2019t some meta-critique on the state of fashion today. As she explained backstage, ever since launching her craft-centric menswear label nearly three years ago, she has been waiting for the right moment (i.e. sufficient resources) to assemble a collection inspired by her familial ties to a bygone wagon workshop based in Cincinnati that produced ornate creations for Barnum & Bailey and the Ringling Brothers. And so, out came her big-top characters dressed in creative adaptions of classic workwear, throwback sportswear, and miscellaneous flamboyance. They moved achingly slow in extroverted stylings of color and print, appearing rigid when they could have been animated. Still, they got the point across that Bode is a worthy, independent outlier. Indeed, if the American-designer-in-Paris conceit has been playing out with greater frequency lately, Bode\u2019s statement felt so idiosyncratic that it could transcend whatever backdrop imposed upon it. This was evident from the first look, a duster coat whose noble stripe might have lined the walls of an 18th-century French salon, to what seemed like horse ribbons pieced together as pants. As a significant departure from previous seasons\u2014and one that will prove essential in scaling up her business\u2014basically all the textiles that looked vintage were now convincing reproductions. But here were also plenty of pieces in standard materials: a crisp belted jumpsuit, a welding jacket in saffron suede or bi-color jersey pants. \u201cIt\u2019s about being able to tell that narrative of the historical techniques and fabrications and then [figuring out] how we can bring this to market in larger way,\u201d she said, delivering a perfect synthesis that would please LVMH Prize judges (she\u2019s a finalist) and buyers alike. With its patchwork jackets, crochet ensembles, and ballet slippers, this gentle exploration of past and present was certainly original if not flawless. Ironically, such wistfulness can start to feel limiting; yet perhaps it\u2019s a question of context. Swap one of the rake-thin models for a basketball player\u2014Rudy Gay and P. J.

That\u2019s because Alejandro G\u00f3mez Palomo is a designer who gleefully drives into the oncoming traffic of conventional gender norms in dress. Allied with the high levels of craft at his disposal at his base in Posadas, Spain, plus the richly imaginative vision through which he utilizes said craft, the result is something special indeed. The shtick behind this morning\u2019s show was that Palomo\u2019s characters were \u201ca new civilization of guys rising from the ashes of Pompeii. They are facing the future, and the future is ugly. It\u2019s plastic, it\u2019s polluted, it\u2019s sabotaged\u2014and it\u2019s rave, it\u2019s sex, and all that.\u201d The fabrication and level of dressmaking here was of a very high standard, with especially beautiful crochet work on fringed crop tops and dresses. Sumptuous laces and organza were cut into flowing garments that sometimes, if you squinted a bit and projected a bit more, could be seen as descendants of the stola, palla, and toga once worn by the doomed citizens of Palomo\u2019s devastated source-material city. Palomo said he wanted to create a sense of wrapping that mirrored the architectural looting of the southern Italian site, and that the check that ran through the collection and that clingy crochet dress were references to mosaics. Mostly, though, Pompeii was used here as a metaphorical device that allowed Palomo to inject a sense of frayed roughness and violence into the palette of his imaginative costume drama. The use of PVC and latex was, apparently, another first for the designer, who said he\u2019s trying to integrate into his offer garments that look forward as well as back. A truly beautiful collection for those liberated enough to see it."}, {"Designer": "Tom Ford", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Tom Ford was the catalyst that kick-started the direction fashion has taken this millennium. Sure, Hedi Slimane was there on backing vocals, and Martin Margiela was already delivering his now also much-imitated woo-woo riffs of genius. But it was Ford at Gucci who birthed the exemplar bass line that fashion has danced to ever since. His was the first spiffing up of a tired old house into something fabulous, glamorous, and highly profitable that so many have followed (with various levels of success) since. For good or ill it was his eye that created the context of today\u2019s weird fashion Tinder-world in which creative directors and houses restlessly swipe this way and that in search of a moneymaking match. That preamble is to emphasize the fact that when Tom Ford speaks, you cup your hand to your ear and listen, hard. For he is a seer. Of late, the guru has mostly kept his own counsel. He has seemed focused on family, films, his saucily monikered fragrance brands, and preparing to do for the CFDA what he once did for Gucci. Thus a visit to Ford\u2019s showroom this afternoon brought no especial presentiment of the gravity-tilting revelation ahead. At first, all seemed as usual. The thick cream shag pile carpet muffled the breathy coos of buyers as his 2020 collection was appreciatively fingered through. There were great suits, and lots of them\u2014razor-cut black or white with monochrome exotic accents and sexy rock-star boots. There were some powerfully shouldered jacquard jackets in radioactively fuchsia leopard and zebra. There were some great fitted perforated leather jackets and matching slim-fit cargo pants in cream. It was all hot-to-trot stuff, but it was all pretty typical, until\u2014shut the front door!\u2014there were the yoga pants. That, at least, is what the swirly patterned, marble-ish and vaguely camo skintight leggings, worn with strappy flat sandals and some fine luxe-technical bombers, most resembled at first glimpse. It was hard to tell precisely, however, because in Casa Ford the lookbook images are shown on a flat-screen gallery that rotates every half second or so, like a too-fast departure-lounge board. There on the rail, tucked alongside that fleshy pink zebra jacquard jacket, were the items IRL. A quick going over established that even though these looked like yoga pants, they were, more strictly, pieces of long-legged underwear\u2014the button-free fly detail made this abundantly clear. Ford, sadly, was not present at this presentation, but he had provided the next best thing: a Ford-penned press release brimming with cogitations upon the season ahead. There, near the bottom, was the key decree: \u201cLong underwear in abstract camouflage prints is worn as casualwear and replaces the training pant this season.\u201d Boom.

Much in keeping with the current menswear trend of informal formality, the silhouette was fluid and elongated; knitted separates, made with the exceptional techniques the house is famous for, were comfortable and versatile, with vibrant colors adding a spirited feel. A dive into the archives led to \u201970s-inspired knitted motifs and prints gracing a jacquard sweater intricately woven with a Tibetan talismanic design with a folksy flair.

She grows vegetables, roses, and\u2014when the birds and bugs don\u2019t get there first\u2014fruit, too. Today Fendi transplanted this most bucolic of pastimes to her next-summer menswear collection. To add extra flourish, she applied a sprinkling of creative fertilizer in the form of a collaboration with this season\u2019s guest artist, the film director Luca Guadagnino. The show was held in the handsome gardens of Milan\u2019s Villa Reale. As we crunched across the gravel to our chairs, we were guided by groundsmen outfitted in khaki Fendi work overalls. Along with fellow gardener and noted tomato specialist, Bruce Pask of Bergdorf Goodman, I cultivated fantasies of tackling the weeding post-show season so chicly attired. Even when horticulturally appropriate, however, the clothes that followed were far too lovely to consider muddying. As they sat in a conservatory earlier, Guadagnino recalled that Fendi first asked him to work with her on this season\u2019s collection when they were backstage together at January\u2019s menswear show, for which Karl Lagerfeld was guest artist. \u201cI was flattered and humbled, and immediately said yes.\u201d The two are in fact longtime creative associates, having first coproduced a short film in 2005. Since then Fendi has notched associate producer credits on both I Am Love and Suspiria. Guadagnino immediately sent Fendi some patterns he had sketched during the shoot for his most recent movie, a swirling abstracted grid, which became the basis of the print used on long side-split shirts inspired by memories of the director\u2019s childhood years in Ethiopia. This was also the basis of cut-out knitwear, shearling cloaks, and tote bags toward the end of the collection whose latticing echoed a gardener\u2019s trellis. Along with Fendi, Guadagnino germinated the idea to have the show soundtracked by Ryuichi Sakamoto and to include elements of the studied, almost formal, precision of Japanese workwear in the collection. The gardening looks were sometimes thrillingly literal: olive drab outerwear with detachable pockets and one great short-sleeved overall, accompanied by clipping baskets, watering cans, and organza-backed gardening gloves. There was a utility vest in botanical-print-organza-clad strips of shearling teamed with a multi-compartment tool bag in leather. Some of the wide-brimmed Bruce Chatwin\u2013inspired travel hats featured apiarist-inflected mesh veils. Luxury-loving gardeners are a pretty niche market, and this collection wisely saw Fendi broaden its purview to encompass soft tailoring with split-hemmed pants arranged around floral-print ties, swimwear teamed with slashed cut-out sections, softly washed workman\u2019s denim that came sometimes leather-patched, and some floral-print camp-collar shirting in silk or organza. These though were all looks that grew from the show\u2019s green-fingered starting point. Before the show Fendi had observed: \u201cIn a time where so much of what we encounter is so virtual and so synthetic, I think the feeling and spirit of wanting to be connected to nature now is stronger than ever before.\u201d In the mise-en-scene she mustered with Guadagnino today, as carefully observed as any in his movies, that spirit fostered as fine a crop of Fendi menswear as we have seen for a while."}, {"Designer": "Tod\u2019s", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Titled The Ride, Tod\u2019s Spring collection revolved around the idea of dynamism, speed, and movement, taking elements from the world of travel streamlined to a minimalist approach, suggesting urban velocity without any literal references.

A new version of the leather biker was the collection\u2019s pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, cut lean and sleek, with a double-striped motif in contrasting colors running on the sides in keeping with Tod\u2019s recurring signature graphics.

Playing on contrasts, a more tailored offering provided an alternative to the collection\u2019s overall sporty vibe, introducing an elegant urban feel with a playful preppy touch. A checkered jacquard was used as an all-over motif for a three-piece city ensemble of matching blazer, pants, and duster.

Bruce Lee was also in a sort of metaphysical attendance, like a spirit animal hovering over the collection; at an earlier preview, the twins sported identical (obviously) T-shirts printed with an image of the most influential martial-artist of all time, worn with the same chinos with printed satin boxers peeking up from the waistline\u2014a look replicated throughout the co-ed show. \u201cHe bridged the gap between the East and the West, between the \u201970s and the \u201980s he was a true pop culture icon,\u201d said Dean\u2014or it was Dan?

The Catens\u2019 take on Chinese iconography and shapes had the sexy edge one expects from a label with a taste for bold provocation, but it wasn\u2019t served in a predictably overt way. \u201cNo, no, no! We do not like to be predictable!\u201d they exclaimed in unison. And actually, they riffed convincingly on the rich, sumptuous, decorative side of Asian iconography, filtered through an \u201980s lens and given a brash, cheeky twist. Chinese-inspired traditional motifs of paper animals, tiger-striped camouflage, peacocks, and lucky-charm monkeys were used. Humongous chrysanthemums were blown up and shot with bright colors, printed on shimmering gold lam\u00e9 or on a black background of silk satin or intarsia leather. The opulence was further amped up in a floor-sweeping padded and patchworked silk kimono, a statement piece which prompted a Wow! exclamation, worn with tight distressed jeans, a Bruce Lee-printed T-shirt, and impossibly high, laced-up fire-red stilettos\u2014an otherwise endangered species on global catwalks. Gold leather reigned supreme, a standout being a corseted and laced-up leather jumpsuit with \u201980s cropped harem pants, inducing a sharp intake of breath from the DSquared2-clad starlets crowding the front row. Another entrance-making number was a floor-sweeping chiffon gown, with undulating pliss\u00e9 ruffles in printed patchworked silk, with an embroidered neckline hanging by thin shoulder straps and worn over a tank top. Compared to the lavishness exuded by the women\u2019s collection, menswear looked almost restrained. \u201cShe takes a lot of space!\u201d explained the designers. \u201cShe demands! She wears the pants!\u201d Men\u2019s silhouettes were leaner than the women\u2019s, elongated in black leather ensembles with a punky vibe and metallic toys, paired with see-through tank tops and shirts. The bold Asian-inspired motifs and tiger-printed lam\u00e9 ran through both collections: for guys they decorated boxy hoodies paired with roomy shorts, printed short-sleeved shirts, or slim bomber jackets worn with dark denim pants. On a rarer note, a padded black silk kimono embroidered with peonies and chrysanthemums, worn with matching slim cropped pants, had the same decorative edge displayed on the women\u2019s looks, even if it never reached the same self-confident boldness.

Slingback cushioned sneakers were geekily cool, as were the boxy rainbow gilets. Just like the trains that rattled along the platforms of Porta Venezia metro station below us (the show was held in an underground mezzanine first opened up by Nike as a free to use dance and exercise studio earlier this year) this was a collection that ran to a painstakingly conceived plan. Its mission was to deliver Palm Angels passengers to a menswear destination that will stand them in good stead for years to come."}, {"Designer": "Sunnei", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "I HATE \u201cFASHION\u201d. So it was written on the tank-tee that will surely be the most \u2019grammed garm of this collection. And while Loris Messina and Simone Rizzo admitted that, sometimes, the pressures of trying to force their now five-year-old brand through the ranks of Milan hopefuls to become safely established makes them feel that way, they created the opposite reaction in their audience. The address, way out of town to the East, boded ill but turned out to be that of the loveliest venue so far this Milan. We were beneath a long stretch of the Tangenziale (ring-road) freeway that encircles the city. Alongside us ran the river Lambro, all dappled green and cool reflection, from which dragonflies came to explore this unlikely addition to their ecosystem. Messina and Rizzo had come to a party here a year ago and became so taken by the place that they negotiated with the authorities and local neighborhood to make it a free open air gallery, curated by them, which opened today. Through the section of hitherto unused urban space\u2014given a refreshing lick of white paint over a 4,000 square meter area\u2014this Sunnei collection ran from white to black through a comprehensive spectrum of brand expression. Not in specific detail, more in mood, it sparked memories of pre-Francesco Risso Marni for both men and women. The height of the women\u2019s platforms, the laundry-bag enormity of the fringe-decorated totes, and the simultaneous volumization and performative delineation through zig-zag placket topstitching on men\u2019s workwear were all acutely thought through and finely actualized. What it feels like to wear is another matter entirely, but the knit effect nylon used for thumbless mitten-like bags, bigger drawstring sacks, men\u2019s tank tops, and women\u2019s looks that connected sweater and skirt with a buttoned bridge layer at the waist looked both slightly wrong and rather right simultaneously. Textile company Albini collaborated with the designers to create a deckchair-striped cotton poplin which had a vaguely penitentiary feeling in all-over outfits for men. And then there was that catnip slogan tank-tee. It was taken directly from the shirt in a photo by Stanley Stellar of an attendee at 1995\u2019s Wigstock festival in New York, and those inverted-commas\u2014so hot right now\u2014made it especially funny. But if this show represented \u201cfashion\u201d\u2014or just fashion\u2014in Milan this afternoon, then it was pretty hard to hate."}, {"Designer": "Etro", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Reading in Vogue Runway yesterday about Etro\u2019s Star Wars capsule, due to jump into retail space on July 1, it was hard to parse how it would meaningfully be integrated into this afternoon\u2019s collection. The fear was that this great merch-led disturbance in Etro\u2019s force would lead to something terrible\u2014or at least highly incongruous\u2014happening on the runway. No worries. Kean Etro, who cites Yoda as his favorite character in the series, has the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. Pre-show he cited Joseph Campbell\u2019s notion of the monomyth\u2014often linked to George Lucas\u2019s films\u2014amongst his usual Gaia-flavored, hippy-vintage, early-sustainability-adopting, spiritual-wanderer mix of seasonal influences (these included a book on astral projection and Le Petit Prince). It also didn\u2019t hurt that this season\u2019s collection\u2014entitled Desert Saga\u2014had an overlap with Tatooine (real location, Tunisia). The collection was gorgeous. As A Horse With No Name was trotted out over the PA, the leather-sandaled models kicked up bright clouds of powder dye as they strode through the garage around the corner from Etro\u2019s headquarters. Their attire was a traveling man (and woman, wearing men\u2019s looks) mix of cross-cultural garments and decoration. Ponchos played against suiting, bombers against kaftan hoodies, and trench coats above keffiyehs. There were richly detailed oasis jacquards on jackets and grip bags, and plenty of rough, textured striping. In many ways Etro is closer to Indiana Jones in spirit than it is to Star Wars. This house has spent years exploring the furthest reaches of human decorative traditions and taking inspiration from them: in this collection there were designs drawn from Indian, Persian, and Mauritanian culture, amongst many others. Which leads, in the present cultural climate, to another potential for disturbance in Etro\u2019s force. Carolina Herrera\u2019s creative director Wes Gordon was only last week called out by Mexico\u2019s culture minister for appropriating the signature patterns of indigenous peoples in that country for his Resort collection. At today\u2019s show one element in Etro\u2019s mix\u2014as declared loud and proud on his moodboard\u2014was patterns and symbols created by Mexico\u2019s Sierra Madre-dwelling Huichol people: what would Kean say if it prompted similar criticism to that leveled at Gordon? \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, but we have to find some way to be free based on mutual respect. I also think about the idea of glocalism we used to talk about so much back in 2001, 2002.\u201d For Etro, reference goes hand in hand with reverence: the extent of Kean\u2019s research and travel is testament to that, as is the beauty of the clothing that results from it."}, {"Designer": "Philipp Plein", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "There\u2019s nothing like a good Philipp Plein show to round off a super-long, super-Saturday of Milan shows. And this was nothing like a good Philipp Plein show. Joke! In fact this Plein outing was perfectly bearable, and the clothes\u2014whisper it\u2014had some redeeming features. Following January\u2019s blessedly straightforward reset, at which the centrally located runway featured The Killers and a not-killer but okay collection, Munich\u2019s most famous Ferrari-favoring mountain-buying no longer an enfant but eternally terrible Swiss-based (for tax reasons) fashion iconoclast had apparently got the message. This was another show full of bombast and performance, but it zinged along promptly. Unless the looming lightning on the horizon ended things early, it looked like the after-party that was shaping up when we left was going to be fun (for those in the mood). The crowd that was apparently watching from the balcony of the Fondazione Prada alongside were probably not in that mood. Part of Plein\u2019s shtick has always been that he is here to storm the ivory towers\u2014such as that Fondazione\u2014of fashion. Tonight he sounded like the grizzliest gatekeeper of them all as he spoke at impassioned length of the dangers of over-discounting\u2014something that certain shareholder driven online wholesale retailers (naming no names) favor to boost short-term revenue results\u2014in affecting the overall perception of a brand. He was passingly scurrilous, on purpose of course, about labels that are not his own, but it is not Vogue Runway\u2019s job to stir the pot on others\u2019 behalf. Another subject we got into was his reported efforts to acquire the Roberto Cavalli brand. These turn out to be true, and were the subject, he said, of four months\u2019 focus, but have, for reasons too niche and potentially litigious to go into here, been apparently aborted. Which leads, at last, to the collection. Once you looked beyond the crowd-pleasing Mad Max: Fury Road cosplay and the cool-looking band (named The Entire Universe) with a Plein-flavored Stevie Nicks-alike (from a distance) on the back of a flatbed (their attire gave me weird Plein-does-Slimane vibes), the clothes that unfolded around the cacophony of background noise represented a development. Plein has shifted his focus from hip hop, his first love, to rock. There was clearly a deal struck with Kiss, whose angled logo featured on boob- and butt-covering patches on sheer minidresses for women and a plethora of biker jackets for men. There were considerably more women\u2019s looks here than menswear, and\u2014following the recruitment of a new design team\u2014they represented a tangible advance. Plein might not need to acquire Cavalli to become Roberto\u2019s true inheritor of blingy animalist and totally unsubtle sexy-sexy dressing\u2014he can just do it himself. The menswear was a rocky remix of Plein tropes enlivened by mismatched studded sneakers and some pretty sleekly cut animalia bikers made cheesy\u2014yet still compelling in their cheesiness\u2014by fluoro color flashes against the predominant black. By the time the designer emerged, air-playing a flamethrower with a guitar attached, we were only an hour after the start time.

That\u2019s partly why the current Italian government\u2019s attitude to immigration sticks in Burlon\u2019s craw. Before this show he said: \u201cWe are living in a very weird moment in Italy. They are closing the ports. They don\u2019t want the people to come over here from Africa. They don\u2019t want immigrants and they are afraid of diversity.\u201d Hence a considerable proportion of Burlon\u2019s casting for his show consisted of first-generation Italians of African descent\u2014one small way in which he felt free to stick two fingers up at the current government of Italy. He added: \u201cwe are also encouraging the kids who follow the brand to vote. In this little world of fashion we try to be activists.\u201d That liberal ideology seemed to be reflected in the fantastic runway installation created by Edoardo Tresoldi, a ceiling-suspended cathedral built of wire mesh, but which in the spotlights resembled a 3D rendered hologram. Its construction was semi-pulled apart to create the impression of a multitude of doorways through which all were welcome to step. Below it Burlon\u2019s usual congregation of professional fashion/music types was enlivened by the addition of 300 local kids who had applied to see the show in an online raffle, and came wearing their signature County of Milan wings T-shirts. Another fresh addition to this collection was the graphic input of Mirko Borsche, who created bar-coded graphic labeling and subtly tweaked other elements of the label\u2019s visual signage. The clothes on which they were stamped were a cycling flavored mix of sportswear mixed with a couple of unexpected tailoring looks and some richly tie-dyed denim. Burlon was making a nod back to his line\u2019s original post-crusty Italianate free-party vibe, which was reflected in the Techno Folk title of the collection. Carabinier earrings from which were suspended inlaid metal \u2018county\u2019 drops, cycle-lock necklaces, and glossed enamel rings were some of the many jewelry pieces on offer. A new licensed collaboration led to a pleasing Easy Rider bowling shirt and printed workman\u2019s jean. Burlon said that he has settled down and made a commitment: for now and henceforth his label\u2019s identifying color will be a Klein-adjacent blue he termed Electro\u2014it looked good in the loose nylon pants and low armed track-tops that were strongly featured here. Another fine touch were the baseball caps with detachable stud-set mesh facemasks, perfect for retreating behind when the action on the dancefloor that was to immediately follow this show became too gnarly."}, {"Designer": "Neil Barrett", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "\u201cThe collection has respect for tradition and heritage,\u201d said Neil Barrett backstage before his show. \u201cBut at the same time it has a break-the-rules kind of attitude.\u201d Known for his sharp, inventive tailoring, mostly in black and white, today\u2019s show felt like the designer celebrating a more youthful spirit and a more diverse, energetic and exploratory approach. Case in point was the showspace, usually stark and minimal. This season Barrett worked with South African artist-in-residence Jody Paulsen creating compelling visuals covering the entirety of the glossy floor, inducing an immersive, almost trippy feel. Paulsen also worked with the designer on creating artworks. A kind of new heraldry and fictional \u2018Old Boy\u2019 crest decorated garments, echoing college scarves, conveying a youthful spirit slashed with a streety vibe. Boxy tops and cropped shorts punctuated the collection, counterbalanced by the play on hybrids, which are one of Barrett\u2019s distinctive style traits. Finely executed and displaying the designer\u2019s skilled tailoring technique and inventive repertoire, they were the collection\u2019s strongest point. Raincoats were mixed with hunting jackets; bombers were blended with truck tops; sweatshirts joined with leather jackets in new imaginative shapes. Even the shoes were given a hybridized treatment, with a new sneaker fusing skateboard and basketball styles and mismatched colors. The show finale embraced the uplifting mood, with a futuristic ghetto blaster incorporated into a sleek black backpack. \u201cYou can carry it around and have a full, major party anytime, anywhere,\u201d enthused Barrett."}, {"Designer": "Kiton", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Menswear\u2019s tailoring evolution is one of the shifting paradigms of modern fashion, and traditional tailors face a daunting challenge, having to confront the global dominance of sportswear and streetwear. The survival strategy for many traditional Italian tailoring companies has been to infuse formal elegance with a sense of ease, without losing handmade, made-to-measure appeal. Balancing technology and craftsmanship is a way to maintain relevance and healthy balance sheets. Kiton\u2019s CEO Antonio De Matteis\u2019s strategy so far has been to focus more and more on his core niche clientele of super wealthy customers, raising the bar of excellence in execution and quality of fabrics\u2014with price points way up in the thousands for suits tailored with famous Neapolitan expertise. You don\u2019t have to look for tectonic shifts at Kiton; every season there are just discreet adjustments to their impeccable suits. The emphasis for Spring was on beautifully textured new lightweight fabrics, and on a Mediterranean color palette with a fresh vibe. Deconstruction was also paramount: \u201cOur blazers have a slim fit that follows the figure, accentuating the waist; a jacket has to be soft, giving freedom of movement, almost \u2018leaning\u2019 on the body without any constricting feel,\u201d said De Matteis. \u201cThe jacket has to live and move with you, almost as if you were making love with it!\u201d he added, in pure #italiansdoitbetter mode. Sportswear was expanded to include a nautical-inspired offer of parkas, vests, and comfortable pants, all designed with an elegant edge; personalized denim pants and jackets were proposed in the precious Japanese Kurabo fiber, highlighting a modern approach and attention to younger customers. On this note, Kiton collaborated with Naples\u2019s Vanvitelli University on a project called IGP for Kiton, an acronym for Intertwined Geographic Proficiency. The students worked on a capsule collection of classic dinner jackets in super-fine wool interpreted creatively, with the handmade basting kept in evidence as a decorative element. Inside every jacket, the geographic coordinates of Kiton\u2019s factory were embroidered; part of the sales revenues will be donated to the school. Youth is very much on De Matteis\u2019s agenda; his twin sons Mariano and Walter\u2019s sporty, cool line KNT (Kiton New Textures) continues to expand. This season they introduced new categories, like short sporty jackets in soft technical fabrications, and a new take on the classic blazer, proposed with no lapels, often hooded and easy as a sweatshirt. It was still cut with Kiton\u2019s signature precision."}, {"Designer": "Dolce & Gabbana", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Enola Gay-era, Victory Girl style pin-up girls\u2014all pneumatic curve and pout\u2014were patched into the opening section of reimagined explorer wear meets Pacific theater khakis or reproduced on some of the many, many silk print camp collar shirts here.

This season Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana wanted to mix a moreish menswear cocktail that packed as much potent tropical punch as the most OTT tiki bar you can barely remember remembering the morning after. As Stefano Gabbana said pre-show, \u201cthe most important thing today is this tropical mood, seen through our Sicilian eyes. What we\u2019ve done is to take elements from the \u201940s and \u201950s, and Elvis, then a little from the \u201980\u2019s\u2014Spandau Ballet\u2014and something from the \u201990s too. Then we add references from our own archive and shake it all up to maybe make something new.\u201d The resurrection of Dolce & Gabbana archival pieces included a loose armed, high-waisted, two top-cut pocketed leather jacket from 1991 (look 57) that came in a direct reproduction of the original and variations painted with those quivering pin-ups. There was also a seriously Sicilian middle section of tight, tight knit tees and shirts plus some loose perforated knit pieces that featured tropical patchwork. These were played against house-standard caps and leather shoes that boasted more embellishments than a presidential tweet. There were also plenty of attractive pajamas, dressing gowns, and pareos featuring southern Italian ceramic prints, and baroquely brocaded pinstripe topcoats and jackets. This was all core house fare. Just as in recent years climate change has allowed Sicilian farmers to begin the cultivation of paw-paw, finger limes, mango, avocado, and other tropical fruit, here Dolce & Gabbana broadened the scope of its decorative cultivation to introduce a riotous Macedonia (that\u2019s Italian for fruit salad) of non-native fare. Watermelon, bananas, pineapple, and more were slung from succulent tropical leaves in a very lingering exploration of extravagant equatorial graphics: Club Tropicana meets Paradise, Hawaiian Style. Leopard print\u2014usually here a reference first and foremost to Lampedusa\u2019s novel, though always used to the utmost for its animalistically sensual implication\u2014was today more literally jungle-sourced and placed against tiger stripe both as runway pattern and on more silk pieces, sometimes cut against the fruit and foliage prints. Leopard also featured on a semi-sheer, super-volumized duster trench\u2014that twist of the \u201980s\u2014which was also presented in khaki and black that came cut in a super-light micro ripstop and a layered tropical print organza. This was a collection packed full of mashed up masculine stereotype from eras now seen as hopelessly pre-woke (which they were) but that also\u2014in the case of those pin-ups, or the wahinis in Elvis Hawaii movies\u2014offered a gentler variety of mass-culture gender objectification than that abroad today. The print of a sports roadster on silk shirts, shorts, swimming briefs, and suits as well as the lace sports uniforms\u2014golf, soccer, rugby, boxing and baseball\u2014were similarly ironically undercut \u2018man\u2019s man\u2019 costume options for fantasy island days and nights."}, {"Designer": "Massimo Alba", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Around a decade ago, not long after he started his own label, Massimo Alba made a great mistake. A batch of shirts and T-shirts he was working on that had already been garment dyed one color were mistakenly exposed to another. Speaking at his showroom presentation this weekend, Alba said: \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to me that so many good things start out as mistakes like this.\u201d That accident was to Alba what the mold-infected petri dish was to Alexander Fleming: a stumbled-upon eureka that led to a career-defining course of investigation. This collection featured a series of softly tailored jackets, corduroy pants and shorts, plus light cashmere sweaters that were hand-overdyed two, and sometimes three colors. It\u2019s a process that led to variations in tone that included acid-trip floods of purple on purple to a subtle bleeding of magenta across mustard yellow. Like most of Alba\u2019s garments, these dyed pieces appeared at first glance conventionally prosaic. The more attention you gave them, however, the more their exceptional qualities became evident. Take a pale blue jacket, for instance, which at that first glance seemed passingly related to a surgeon\u2019s scrubs. To the hand it was light and almost textureless in its softness: The fabric was a cotton mousseline developed for Alba by Albini. Long-sleeved, in a delicately mottled finish of washed-out sky blue, it made for an ideal mid-summer shacket; in pink, sleeveless, it was an impactful shirting second skin. Other interesting developments this season included a cotton pant named the Myles with a cutely kinking stitched gather at knee-level on both legs and another handsome pant, baggy in white poplin, with patch pockets. A blue tropical weight jacket named the Lenny, after Bernstein, was Alba\u2019s interpretation of a bohemian creative\u2019s ideal piece of workwear. Collarless shirts in ripstop linen and button-up short-sleeves in terry were further finely effective coups de th\u00e9\u00e2tre. Alba is a self-deprecating yet dangerous designer: Try just one carefully chosen piece and that\u2019s it, you\u2019re spoiled for good\u2014because nobody else quite compares."}, {"Designer": "Emporio Armani", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Considering that Giorgio Armani is a designer for whom, more than any other, consistency both in manner and output has for decades been an unambiguously fixed point\u2014a creative center of gravity\u2014the signs of change there this season seemed a hint of something seismic. Monday evening\u2019s mainline collection presentation was moved to his headquarters at Via Borgonuovo, which last hosted a show 18 years ago. And while this morning\u2019s Emporio show was held, as ever, at the venue built to replace Borgonuovo, the alterations inside the Armani theater were relatively radical: Instead of maybe 10 rows of seating down the two long sides of the room, the furniture was today rearranged to mirror a presentation given for Armani Casa at April\u2019s Salone del Mobile. This meant reducing the seating to four rows, but around all four sides of the room. Suspended from its formerly un-interfered with roof were four levels of 4x3 gridded semi-sheer panels. And rather than walking from one side of the room to the other, this time the models walked around it and back again. To Armani-ologists, these subtle alterations added up. Maybe the most telling declaration of a new spirit abroad in this company came in a stop-motion sentence of three successive looks around two thirds of the way through this\u2014some things never change\u2014very long show. The first saw the debut appearance in this collection of a tie, knotted smartly and tight under a collared shirt and above a fitted gray-to-white garment-dyed double-breasted jacket and loose, creased pants in a stiffened fabric. In the next look, the tie above a flecked-check white on blue linen jacket and some crinkled loose black viscose pants was fair wrenched from its collar, as if the model had emerged the worse from a passionate debate with his stylist. In the third the tie, above another linen check jacket, was pulled still lower. The forcibly removed tie reflected an Emporio collection in which\u2014although there was a five-look core of fitted formal business suiting worn with some of the very few non-sneakers on view in this show\u2014the majority of looks were either rooted in sport and performance wear or displayed echoes of sartorial motif on a canvas of radical future-facing fabrication. The opening section felt powerfully EA7, Armani\u2019s pure-sport line, in its plethora of Velcro attached webbing pochettes, tracksuits, and parkas. \u201cGENERATION EA\u201d declared the branding on the arms of technical blousons worn under harnesses. Four looks on the trot featured harnesses attached to loosely billowing white silk parachutes, perhaps another nod to the leap this collection was looking to make. Later there was a long series of looks that clashed the informal and formal on a color palette of iridescent gelateria hues: apricot, lemon, lime, and pistachio. The fabrics were often treated to reflect the already piercingly unnatural light of the space to refract and shimmer with movement. Towards the end were a series of evening jackets, with leather shoes reinstated, upon which were patterned various jacquard pixelated meltings, suiting equivalents of Neo\u2019s existentially suggesting screen collapse in The Matrix. A not-quite-final look was a suede bomber, with a similarly dotted mantel of mirrored decoration at the shoulder and chest. That look was not-quite-final because the last section of this show saw a sudden sidestep from the business of Emporio Armani to mark the company\u2019s long-term position fitting Italy\u2019s Olympic and Paralympic athletes. The national insalata caprese-hued tricolor was projected on the floor and John Paul Young\u2019s Love Is In The Air blared loud as perhaps 30 athletes came out in their EA7 Italy tracksuits, some waving gymnast\u2019s ribbons and silver hoops. It was a warm, feel-good moment that rose to a climax as the racing driver and double-amputee Gold medal winning paracyclist Alessandro Zanardi completed the final lap of the show by wheelchair. Mr. Armani came out, waved and half-bowed, then returned backstage."}, {"Designer": "Ermenegildo Zegna", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "This first show on the Milan Menswear Fashion Week schedule was shown way beyond the city limits\u2014we\u2019d apparently traveled halfway back to Florence barely hours after leaving it. However there was design behind the gesture\u2014ambition in the collection that matched the scale of the journey to reach it. For the venue to which we schlepped was the titanic, rusted ribcage of the Falck iron mill, which from its foundation in 1903 to its closure in 1995 provided the raw materials that fueled much of Lombardy\u2019s economic flourishing for companies including Olivetti and Alfa Romeo. Today this huge site has been cleaned (so Alessandro Sartori assured us) of the long-seeping toxic chemicals in its soil and work will soon begin on a Renzo Piano envisaged redevelopment to create huge new housing capacity and a new home for the region\u2019s cancer and neurological hospitals. The hulking superstructure in which we sat will remain as a monument\u2014and admonishment\u2014of 20th-century industrialism. Thus this blighted, rubble-strewn, fume-blown Mad Max-like landscape made the geographically inconvenient but thematically ideal site for this collection. That aptness was two-fold, both in substance and aesthetic. Substance-wise, a solid 20 percent of the clothes on show were made of both nylon and wool upcycled from existing Ermenegildo Zegna waste product. According to Sartori, 20 percent of wool is lost at the spinning stage, another 20 percent at the weaving stage, and then a final 10 percent at the cutting stage. Here that wool, and off-cut nylon too, was used either to make completely new pieces or was mixed with other \u2018new\u2019 materials to make them. Sartori added that Zegna research suggests both wool and nylon can be recycled up to four times\u2014so re-re-re-recycled\u2014and that the company is pushing on to that. It seems certain that soon our value system will rate recycled/upcycled/carbon neutral etc. materials as more precious than those which represent ecological depletion\u2014especially if they look as good: oldness will be the new newness. Here, from a purely dumb fashion perspective, the upcycled items ranked by no means below those hewn from virgin materials. These included the crunchy nylon suit in look three, and the full arm-printed jackets and parkas in looks 10, 15, 29, and 31. Aesthetically, our venue was reflected in the base layer of grays, rust, and metallics that formed the underlying color story on the runway of loose black gravel. Many of the pieces were pressed during fabrication to create irregular pleats and creases that either looked drunkenly ironed or sensitively patterned, disposition depending. This irregular patterning was reflected not only in the rusting ironwork above us and the by-now widely scored tread marks on that runway, but in the print-on-print irregular grid pentimento that featured on many of the garments\u2014the underlying aesthetic story hinted at layers of use and re-use. In a show of such epically grand a scale, it was understandable if the smaller\u2014but by no means less agonized over\u2014details passed unmissed. Sartori\u2019s new short-sleeved shirt version of his commercially successful bomber suit, his excellent three-button silk suiting, and a gorgeous faded suede top coat were amongst them. Radical change always comes with casualties, however, and the finer points in this collection will be there to pore over and enjoy in the wearing over the season\u2014and seasons\u2014to come."}, {"Designer": "Theory", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "As the Spring 2020 men\u2019s shows roll to a close in Milan today, a surprising trend has emerged on the runways and the streets: shorts. There have been a lot of exercised quads on display. In New York, Theory\u2019s Martin Andersson made his own contribution. Having taken tropical modernism as a starting point for his new Theory collection, he did a navy shorts suit, and also showed shorts with sportswear layers: A suede jacket topped a ribbed knit sweater, nylon anorak, and trim bermudas. Andersson said this was a collection about texture. When the humidity spikes, the New York subways are a sweat factory and tailoring becomes a real turn-off. So he set about sourcing fabrics that can work in extreme temperatures. The company\u2019s traceable \u201cGood Linen\u201d was blended with tech fabric for a modern touch on a \u201cbalsa\u201d-color suit.

CA.", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Immediately after the show, held in a 19th-century hay manger, we hacks clustered into a room below that had originally been a horse shelter, the better to gaze at this fully fledged fashion thoroughbred\u2014no, this seeming unicorn of fashion who had suddenly appeared before us. \u201cThat,\u201d said Suzy Menkes, \u201cwas the best new-person collection I have ever seen.\u201d Behind her, Pierre Rougier\u2019s eyes widened at the compliment paid to his client by that most dauntless journalist, who has probably witnessed more collections than the rest of us put together. Sterling Ruby is certainly one of the most charming runway debutants ever\u2014not at all up himself\u2014and this collection was indeed of an outstanding standard for a first-timer. However, it must be conceded that while a new person on the end of a runway, Ruby comes to the game with credentials no other debut designer has ever possessed. For not only does he have 33 years of clothes-making experience (he first started with a sewing machine at age 13), but he is also an internationally renowned millionaire contemporary artist with a mighty aesthetic back-catalog to mine. Famously (at least in fashion), he was first collected by and then later became a friend of Raf Simons, with whom he collaborated recently for Calvin Klein (draw the veil), and also earlier for a 2014 Simons collection. As Ruby told W Magazine that year of his experience at the show: \u201cEverybody was standing up, cheering. At that moment I thought, \u2018Fuck being an artist\u2014this is wonderful.\u2019 \u201d Fast-forward to tonight\u2014via a 2016 exhibition in London\u2019s Spr\u00fcth Magers gallery of battered, bleached, dyed, and color-spattered denim\u2014and Ruby has finally engineered his own wonderful moment. He is a manic, super-scale collagist, and as well as the many themes drawn from his own personal journey, there were echoes here of Simons in some silhouettes and also of Rick Owens\u2019s meaningfully meditative primitivism, especially in the semi-rigid ponchos made of a patchwork of mixed materials that came piped with a sort of selvedge time-stamp to act as a mark of provenance. This was part of a careful dedication to captioning-by-label prevalent not only in Ruby\u2019s gallery home world, but also in the work of Virgil Abloh (who was in attendance). Most of this, though, was derived directly from the work emerging from Ruby\u2019s sprawling California studio complex. The printed dresses and shirting featured imagery of candles and weeds shot by Ruby\u2019s wife, Melanie Schiff. One model wore a vinyl tabard bearing the lurid coverwork of a book entitled Hex, a 1972 examination of pow-wow and murder in the Pennsylvania Dutch community amidst which he was partially raised. This childhood influence presumably also influenced the Mennonite-style dresses in bleached denim. Ruby said the stalagmite-like U.S. flag decals on his denim pieces reflected certain sculpted works; Ruby-philes will doubtless recognize many more entanglements between his artistic body of work and the beginning of this new one as they look at these clothes. Arguably the boldest element of all on show tonight was the act of a famed contemporary artist transitioning into the world of fashion design. Fashion traditionally tugs its forelock at contemporary art, while contemporary art is happy to take fashion\u2019s sponsorship cash and revel in its assumed superiority in the creative hierarchy. Ruby, conversely, seems to be genuinely enthused by this new aspect of his practice, and who is to say his fashion will not prove as lucrative as his art? This \u201ccollection\u201d is, in fact, not one but four collections: Some pieces went immediately on sale, see-now-buy-now style, and are presumably the fashion equivalents of print editions. The rarer, presumably (even) more expensive, and in theory more collectible\u2014and consequently more likely to gain in value\u2014items will be presented to the market later. Some models wore cast metal rivets, or carried hatches and axes also cast in metal: It was unclear whether these \u201caccessories\u201d would be sold too. What does seem likely, however, is that if you purchase a pair of black Sterling Ruby blurry twig-print yoga pants (they were worn under a long, color-patched hand-knit cardigan), you might be making a fashion investment that truly accrues. When asked about the difference between making fashion and the production of art, Ruby said: \u201cIn many respects, outside of the logistics of putting together the collection and the garments\u2014in the kind of production of it\u2014I don\u2019t see it as any different to making a sculpture or painting.\u201d He added of making objects that are worn: \u201cI kinda find that more rewarding. Not that I mind if somebody has a painting and hangs it on the wall, but it is fun to think of something going out into the world, and moving, and being something for people to see.\u201d And will this be an every-season thing? \u201cI think 15 minutes ago I may not have been able to say yes or no, but now\u2026yes! It might not be seasonal, but I will do it again.\u201d America\u2019s most interesting new fashion designer is also one of its most prolific and successful contemporary artists.

This season he gently refined his harmonic formula to allow for a slightly broadened jacket shape, a wider lapel, and a short-pleated pant.

One combination saw a delicately ripped jean worn below a hand-softened T-shirt under a gray linen striped blazer, all atop a suede tasseled loafer.

Hotly glowing phones aplenty rose aloft in appreciation. The clothes worn outside those briefs were a carefully crafted and loudly projected mix of very much. Boxy, loose, high-lapelled three button jackets reminiscent both of the silhouette we saw at Givenchy last night and at Versace in the 1990s and intermittently since were worn above soft cargo pocket pants or shorts. Camp collar shirts in lobster, poppy, or bandana paisley prints were mashed against pants and track jackets in lividly clashing two-tone leopard print. Sebago boat shoes and linen blousons and shorts featured naive graphics and heartfelt scrawled messages of summer love. A collaboration with the painter Norbert Bisky produced an attractive fractured portrait used as prints on shirting, shorts, and perforated nylon vests or in panels on the tailoring. Especially inventive were the denim pieces bleached to create a pattern reminiscent of the dappled azure water in sunlight. There was a longish section of richly colored tie-dye denim looks near the end whose attractive fade and idiosyncratic pattern illustrated the hand-made aspect that Giorgetti is so keen to telegraph in his clothes at the moment. These looks were sometimes punctuated by others in which the models wore their Filas strung around their necks just to ensure we got the message about that collaboration. Giorgetti said: \u201cI'm also especially proud because I think MSGM is maybe the only contemporary brand in which everything is 100 percent made in Italy: it\u2019s all done between Milano, Rimini, and Ancona, which makes me very happy.\u201d The result of 10 years\u2019 hard labor, this was an easy-to-love, endless summer of a collection."}, {"Designer": "Woolrich", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Although Woolrich has yet to secure the necessary city permits, the plan is that its soon-to-open New York store will feature a \u201cweather room\u201d in which shoppers will be able to test-drive garments in temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius.

In the event\u2014which was held in the vast formal gardens of the Villa Palmieri\u2014the connections she made were much more interesting and unexpected; ideas sparked between her own memories of the 1990s and the hyper-modern dandyism of today\u2019s Korean street culture. \u201cI find what\u2019s happening incredibly vibrant,\u201d she said. \u201cParticularly young men in Seoul, who are meticulous about fashion, sort of tribal, sort of cultish, and highly accessorized.

She\u2019s entering into it at Givenchy at a time when the tailoring-versus-athleisure debate has been running for years.

She spent her 20s growing up as a designer at Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren. \u201cIt was Ralph who gave me a classic education, a good education in tailoring,\u201d she says. \u201cI was in New York the whole of the \u201990s, the best time.

At the core is minimalist suiting, with a span of options from a wider, looser shoulder to draped tonic coats to neat jackets. So far, so good for turning into a clean, Helmut Lang\u2013ish look. What made the crucial difference were head-turning fabrics she\u2019d also discovered in Korea. The movement of a super-light pale yellow parka over a beige suit, the slick teal nylon raincoat, and the strange, dense velvet nylons kept audience members talking during the long evening\u2019s after-party. There was a lot more going on, too: six great slim suits on women (\u201cliterally men\u2019s,\u201d she said); tapestry and floral prints; 10 different pant silhouettes; and a finale of beaded and embroidered pieces. \u201cThe evening segment for men has exploded for us.\u201d In the end though, it\u2019s always the simple messages that are the clinchers.

For Spring, the property under Lundman\u2019s eye was a summer estate just outside of Uppsala, purchased in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus.

Printed silk shirting and shorts illustrated with taxonomic botanical sketches based on those with which Linnaeus wallpapered his summer retreat were scientifically cool.

Sprinkled among the men\u2019s looks in this Pitti-presented show were a fair few women\u2019s too, from De Vincenzo\u2019s first Resort collection in two years. The menswear bore the mark of its maker. Fabrication levels were extremely high, and displayed a consciously lurid glamour. The pinstripes on pants and jackets and the piping on a trench coat worn above a pair of micropleated coated tulle pants flashed with Lurex. Such was the emphasis on pleating, in fact, that certain looks resembled Italianate Issey Miyake. Those most especially included a black suit and a black shorts suit in a gently undulating horizontally pleated wool, and light and wide pleated culottes pour hommes. You\u2019d need to be a bold guy to wear them, but given Florence\u2019s fiery weather right now\u2014and the show\u2019s venue in a 19th-century tropical greenhouse\u2014they felt pretty pragmatic too. Elsewhere, lushly printed silk shirts, transformable from long-sleeved into short via unbuttoning above the elbow, were decorated with feathers and stars. Probably the highest-cut jeans you will ever see were belted inches south of the armpit. Lower slung were a pair of hip-borne shorts suspended from an X-strapped pinafore.

The word backstage doesn\u2019t really fit the Palazzo Vecchio\u2019s sumptuously frescoed courtyard, where the pre-show mayhem was in full swing. \u201cNo fashion show has ever been allowed in Piazza della Signoria before,\u201d said Andrew. \u201cSo this is definitely a major first.\u201d It was also the first show with the designer in the role of creative director of both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s lines, and the first time that Ferragamo staged a fashion show in its hometown of Florence. The label contributed to the recently completed restoration of the majestic Fountain of Neptune, which dominates Piazza della Signoria, the city\u2019s beating heart. \u201cIt was this idea of coming home for Ferragamo,\u201d said Andrew. \u201cI thought, how epic would it be doing my first men\u2019s show during Pitti, which celebrates its 30 birthday this year, with this spectacular fountain as backdrop.\u201d A little ego trip definitely goes a long way. Though everyone thought the idea was bonkers, Andrew persisted and lots of lengthy negotiations with the city mayor ensued. \u201cAnd voil\u00e0! Here we are,\u201d he exclaimed. To top this magnificent location, only a fashion show in Rome\u2019s Saint Peter\u2019s Square would do, but negotiating with the Pope would probably be a much trickier matter. As an homage to the city, a series of prints abstracting Neptune\u2019s impressively toned torso graced a series of loose shirts and lightweight parachute parkas in delicate pastel hues. The charming, rather feminine color palette\u2014neutral tones breaking into more vibrant shades of sky blue and orange, softened by hints of lavender, mint, and periwinkle\u2014was one of the distinctive traits of the collection, which revolved around workwear templates rethought with a more formal, luxe flair, but without losing a sense of lightness. While workwear conveyed the ideas of utility and comfort so paramount today, the obvious and ubiquitous sportswear inspiration was addressed obliquely, mostly in the use of high-tech fabrications of excellent quality and impeccable Italian craftsmanship. \u201cIt\u2019s that mix of high-tech and high-craft that has become my shtick for Ferragamo,\u201d said the designer. Actually, it\u2019s a concept very much connected with Salvatore Ferragamo\u2019s original philosophy; he was ahead of the game, using materials and experimenting with shapes never done before, but always rendered with the extraordinary artisanal finesse. Working alongside the company\u2019s men\u2019s design director Guillaume Meilland, Andrew kept the play on shapes neat and graceful, infused with a kind of restrained gloss. Volumes were sleek and just slightly oversize, to highlight a dynamic sense of ease. The same spirit was also reflected in the women\u2019s looks, almost with a unisex approach. Georgina Grenville looked gorgeous in a softly tailored periwinkle shorts suit, but it would\u2019ve been equally smart on the actor Hero Fiennes-Tiffin, Ralph and Joseph Fiennes\u2019s genetically blessed nephew, who closed the show and will be the face of the new Ferragamo advertising campaign. The young Fiennes was part of a diverse cast that included the actor Josh Lucas, the stunning model Cecilia Chancellor, Sotheby\u2019s European chairman Michael Berger-Sandhofer, and art director extraordinaire Peter Saville.

Five of the looks in it are fittingly by Ermenegildo Zegna (including one of the founder\u2019s own suits), and two were made under the stewardship of Alessandro Sartori. This label turned a fresh page of its own today by presenting a Z Zegna reimagined via a new team and a new logo, but, most importantly, of a new philosophy. Sartori said it was partially a philosophy of alignment, \u201cto apply a tailoring approach\u2014how the silhouette is made, the fabrics, the construction of the shoulder\u2014to every aspect of Z Zegna, where there was before a split between sportswear and tailoring.\u201d Arguably more significantly for those not au fait with the brand\u2019s semantics was a newly overt emphasis on sustainability. If any fashion giant can reinvent itself as a sustainable operation, it is Ermenegildo Zegna. Famously vertically operated, it administers its own chain of supply, manufacture, and delivery from its farms and mills via its factories to its retail chain. Sustainability, however, is no quick-change; as Sartori said: \u201cIt takes time because you have to look at absolutely every action and every process. But we are looking, and changing.\u201d After hearing Sartori\u2019s description of the alterations applied to Z Zegna, the fear was that this excellent source of geeky yet sleek, functional luxury sportswear would have been fully taken over by tailoring; in construction and fabric that was, as promised, the case. Thankfully, however, the garments to which the philosophy applied offered plenty for punters disinterested in wearing a suit. The theme of the collection centered around desertification. These were indeed dashing ensembles for whatever aridly apocalyptic futures-cape awaits unless global warming is reversed. Pants and jackets mixed crunchily treated flax and panels of recycled synthetics. One parka shifted with dune-like shimmers of color warp, thanks to a moir\u00e9 process novelly applied to (recycled, water-bottle sourced) nylon. There was a clever collision of traditional tailoring checks with voguish-ly \u201ctechnical\u201d mesh materials. Of course there were tailored jackets, some in boucl\u00e9, some in the check-on-check, and others in ultra-light treated cottons. These featured insulating pocket-flap details and shirting-light shoulder construction. Worn under a red recycled synthetic and ripstop panel parka, a bomber-jacket tracksuit in a finely red-checked blue weave of the company\u2019s machine-washable Techno Merino fabric looked like a trusty companion for future service as both dress codes and global weather conditions change.

His revival of a 1950s-through-to-1990s Belstaff produced a fishing vest\u2014chest-thumpingly named the Castmaster, in sidewalk-appropriate orange and riverbank-appropriate khaki\u2014that had this punter hooked (I\u2019ve since snagged a vintage example on eBay). It also included arms to make a very fine jacket. A corduroy collared Trialmaster in weathered patches of variously shaded khaki and olive cotton looked manly on its mannequin. A jacket with roughened metal fastenings in a nylon British Army woodland camo looked very fine as well, as did the beautifully treated green T-shirt worn layered under a shirt. Another four-pocket coat came in a thick olive canvas duck-piped in washed bridle leather.

As the first models emerged from backstage, the fuzzy screens came into focus, projecting not a live stream of the runway, but of the audience, many of whom were documenting the experience themselves. The effect was unsettling: Suddenly the front row was under surveillance. To add to that sense of foreboding, all the models wore identical bobbed wigs (a curious trend that has emerged at the shows these past few days) and masks fixed with mechanical grins and garish makeup.

The distinctive Iranian block-prints she\u2019s used before came through in baggy, drawstring pants, along the panels of smart zippered jackets, and spliced through a patchwork suit, an impressive finale look. They covered many of the high-top sneakers made in collaboration with Converse, too. The show\u2019s standout was a zippered coat with matching trousers made from what looked like repurposed shipping packaging. It came tagged with airport stickers and, more ominously, plastered with \u201cborder force\u201d tape issued by the British government, perhaps as a reference to the public outrage over tightening immigration laws that continues to bubble up in the wake of the Windrush scandal. The show ended on an uplifting note, as models distributed yellow roses to members of the audience.

The floor of his runway was a mirror that created the illusion of models walking across a bottomless chamber. \u201cPeople scrutinize themselves in mirrors, showing us another possibility of being,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to show that things didn\u2019t have to be from one place\u2014not negative or positive, but celebratory.\u201d People commonly talk about DNA and codes when they speak about brands\u2014Green, the three-time awarded Menswear Designer of the Year, clearly has his: the channel quilting, the ties and tabs, the flatness and geometry, the impression that his clothes relate to utilitywear. All of this puts him recognizably and securely in the practical category of a wearable, saleable designer. He continued to exhibit that throughout this collection, from the opening: leather coats, overalls, and tailored trousers with square external pockets, in black or brown\u2014modern male chic. \u201cIt began with thinking a lot about skin\u2014that you wear leather to protect yourself when you\u2019re on a motorbike,\u201d Green said. Skin: That thought led him to multiple places of research and connection, with \u201cZoroastrian anatomical drawings, and a weird Egyptian idea\u2014this idea of being embalmed and buried with all your worldly goods\u201d coming into it. He traveled from there into Christian Easter celebrations\u2014resurrection iconography\u2014and the series of papery cutouts, described as \u201cflags made from sails,\u201d which he likened to things he\u2019d seen in Mexican markets. When you got deep into the symbolism of his extraordinary pieces in padded satin, with ribs and muscle groups scattered over with feathery embroidery, you wondered what the multiple dangling \u201cgloves\u201d were. Look twice or three times, and they started to look less like gloves, and more like the appendages of a flayed body. Or, in Green-speak, \u201cdancing deities.\u201d One minute, Green is coolly showing easy, pinstripe pajama suits, and the next he\u2019s sending out almost floor-length gingham caftans stamped with some kind of mystic grid pattern. In fact, he said they were \u201cinstruction diagrams for folding shirts I saw on a Marie Kondo video.\u201d That last revelation ranks as the most unexpected of London Men\u2019s Fashion Week. As he masterminds his schemes of codes, hieroglyphs, and prints, Craig Green is a down-to-earth guy with a brilliant mind."}, {"Designer": "Martine Rose", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "When she chooses her moment to speak, people flock to hear what Martine Rose has to say.

Like Charles Jeffrey\u2019s Loverboy show, it was a defiant\u2014and even more angry\u2014response to the political mess Britain is in, with no resolution to Brexit in sight and trust in politicians at an all time low. The viewing was a very different experience from the welcoming warmth of the local neighborhood street party Rose held this time last year; deliberately so. She was wearing a T-shirt featuring the slogan Promising Britain with a cartoon of a clown surrounded by European Union flag stars when she came out to explain her collection\u2014a blunt satirical indictment of what\u2019s been going on in the Houses of Parliament for months and months. \u201cIt\u2019s laughable but terrifying at the same time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are clowns, politicians.

It\u2019s all confused, like what\u2019s going on right here and internationally, too. Playful, but sinister, I\u2019d say.\u201d Fashion-wise she made a strong case for tailored flares and chinos with cargo pockets, three-quarter drape jackets, and concertina-pressed shirts. There were off-proportions gathered from ravers, skinheads, rastas, and disco-goers of yesteryear, cultural notes remade for a young generation to arm itself against disunity. The last word on her press release, in capitals was coexist. Rose shook her head in conclusion. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not normally a pessimistic person. I\u2019m an optimist.

In truth, there was neither a scintilla of the four-way equation of romantic agony squared by ecstasy of that movie, nor any especially discernibly Asian elements here\u2014except perhaps for the blended cultures behind the collarless Mao/Nehru-style jacket that Spencer has long successfully pitched as an \u201cArtist\u201d jacket.

Mature casualwear highlights included sash-belted field jackets, striped jersey polos, coquille-print shirts and shorts, and deconstructed tailoring in madras check cotton and plain drill.

Strength in unity.\u201d These words, spoken off-the-cuff by Saul Nash, the newest of the designers to come into the fold created by Lulu Kennedy\u2019s Fashion East could be taken as a boilerplate statement for the diversity that\u2019s rising through London\u2019s young creative community. As set against the horrors of the social divisions that Brexit has brought to the surface, the trio brought together under this long-standing not-for-profit organization consists of one black British male designer, Nash; an Irish woman designer, Robyn Lynch; and the Nigerian Mowalola Ogunlesi. All very different talents\u2014yet all Londoners, and all products of British art schools. Saul Nash is a dancer and choreographer from North London who gained a scholarship to explore his interest in performancewear at the Royal College of Art. His opening section of a group of dancers consisted of friends and peers, there to demonstrate the innovations Nash has in development; clothes designed to enhance freedom of movement through his system of curved zippers and mesh. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of technical fabrics that I\u2019m progressing\u2014I see it that way, as opposed to scrapping things every season and starting again.\u201d Above and beyond that, the point for him in having a runway show was to be able to share something about masculinity and emotional bonds. \u201cThey\u2019re all really strong dancers. I cast them because each one brings a sense of himself. For me, movement can say a thousand words.\u201d Lynch also designs out of personal experiences\u2014in her case, reminiscing about old-school sport uniforms as they used to be worn in Irish communities in the days before sports-kit had anything to do with fashion. She had a thorough-going vision, reiterating hitched-up shorts, T-shirts, regular trousers, and fragments of Aran knitting in waves of top-to-toe color. It was Ogunlesi\u2018s second outing at Fashion East, and she had huge audience appreciation for it. Building and strengthening what she did at Central Saint Martins, she concentrated on using slick colored leathers to make halter-necked suits, with tight pants and belts buckled with sacred and profane symbols: a cross, a religious icon, the Stars and Stripes, the words sexy and m-ther f-cker. \u201cI base it on what I\u2019m going through\u2014I\u2019ve just fallen in love for the first time; I feel as if no one talks about the horrific side, the dangers of love, of losing control of your emotions and feeling like you\u2019re crazy. It\u2019s like how I see a horror movie!\u201d she related. \u201cSo this is as if I\u2019m in a black Woodstock Festival, and someone has been murdered.\u201d Her picture of glam hyper-sexual carnage\u2014including gunshot wounds and bloodied hands\u2014is strong stuff, evidence of a kind of club scene that runs between London and Lagos.

Strips of black wool used to create a long ruffle-skirted jacket with cut stones and stud detailing over the left pectoral were entirely sourced from upcycled off-cuts from the McQueen cutting room floor. Another jacket, in quietly conflicting widths of pinstripe, featured an eye-snagging false collar beneath the left lapel that made for a double single-breasted effect. There were suits in blazing white broderie anglaise and full-on fuchsia mohair (both great looks to get married in) and another, this one black, with inlaid panels of black lace (perfect for the party after). The collection also looked back, way back, to evoke the period in which Burton and Lee McQueen would travel to Japan on inspiration trips. The half-kilted jackets were, in part, a nod to McQueen himself as well as continuation of a house shape. Further expressions of the house\u2019s decorative ways included embroidered dragons on the back of double-layered jackets; pressed-flower embroideries on the hems of scarf-attached shirting; the bleeding-color Rorschach florals that featured on suits; and trenches. The models wore metal-set crystal pendants and earrings for good vibes, plus leather shoes and sneakers with steroidal-accentuated tread soles for extra size.

The spotlight trained on what Cooke and Burt do is well deserved: the believable young masculinity their collections portray, its basis in inventing techniques that recast the structure of familiar garments\u2014like the wonder they bring to the humble argyle sweater\u2014and their playful knack for trompe l\u2019oeil prints. All this, and a precocious talent for creating stuff that is so clearly wearable. So, anyway: The wunderkind double act thought about backstage theater and costume as a theme for the first stand-alone Stefan Cooke show. \u201cReally, it goes back to costume, to acting\u2014to us learning how to be someone over the last 15 months,\u201d said Burt. \u201cIt\u2019s like us, really, people think you\u2019re a certain way,\u201d Cooke added. \u201cAnd the reality is, we\u2019re still living in a flat with two other graduates.\u201d They\u2019re not moaning\u2014and if they\u2019re feeling the pressure, it only resulted in another uplifting collection that combined grandly romantic gestures with progressing and refining what Stefan Cooke is known for. The importance of primary research is drilled into Central Saint Martins students\u2014one reason that they visited \u201ca lot of costume archives, and we liked the idea of replicating something we saw from the 15th century\u2014but with only 20 pence to do it.\u201d So they printed scans of antique pieces onto canvas, and cinched the fronts of jackets with cross-laced corseting. That was the start of putting together a coherently delightful top-to-toe look that tethered delicacy to a brilliant color sense: pink, lemon, red. The other part of the energy came from keeping eyes open on their first trip to New York\u2014Matchesfashion.com, early champions, took them to meet the press a few weeks ago. London kids looking at New York kids in the streets, they were impressed by the precise way guys in the city will pair sweatpants with something more flamboyant. It was plain to see that the hybrid jersey-trousers they came up with will be immediately leapt on; so too, everything they took forward with their \u201cnegative space\u201d lattice-effect argyle sweaters.

As parsed in the recently posted Resort collection review, this season\u2019s Chalayan boogie is based around his cogitations as to the effect of colonization upon dance. This is not the place to recap that rhythm, but instead to examine the shapes thrown as a result. Chalayan\u2019s prints variously reflected the cultural impositions upon South America (by Spain and Portugal) and Japan (by the U.S.) that he was grooving to. The swishy drapes that gestured on the surface of garments were material shadows of dance moves. Each model carried a cute little beatbox that variously emitted grunts and foot-squeaks of a dancer\u2019s effort, or abstracted rhythm. Some jackets and pants in crispy linens and cottons featured panels that hinted at the capacity of dance to both reveal and conceal.

Grant\u2019s overall proposition for Spring was clear from the opening look: tangerine linen shorts and an inky black-and-white print dolman shirt. Much like his trademark trousers, Grant\u2019s shorts had an easy, oversized shape even when they were cut high on the thigh, a more forgiving antidote to the recent trend for men\u2019s hot pants. In fact, the Bermuda versions in the lineup would even tempt shy fashion guys to ditch their slacks. Grant cited British social documentarian Tish Murtha as an influence\u2014one of her distinctive black-and-white photos of northern English youth covered the show invitation. The groovy floral prints featured on cotton button-downs and cargo shorts were inspired by the wallpaper prints and upholstery often found in the working-class homes where Murtha would shoot her subjects.

Scott\u2019s Los Angeles show was underpinned by a trip-down-memory-lane nostalgia, yet more importantly, it was literally screaming with humor and modernity. It all worked; the payoff was kind of brilliant. Held at Universal Studios\u2014along the same set that served as Wisteria Lane on Desperate Housewives\u2014Scott sent forth his models as trick-or-treaters in a foggy twilight. There were references to horror-core galore: Redrum printed vertically on a dress (The Shining); neon green leather with trompe l\u2019oeil stitches (Frankenstein); a model shrieking and banging on doors (an homage to Drew Barrymore\u2019s character in Scream, which Scott mentioned was one of the night\u2019s main inspirations). Yet even though there were a lot of silver-screen throwbacks, the takeaway was very Stranger Things (season three airs in three weeks). It felt like suburbia blanketed in sugary faux-creepiness, a polychromatic Edward Scissorhands-ian moment for the Instagram era. \u201cI wanted to take the most mundane, beautiful, manicured, perfect setting because that\u2019s where the darkest things always happen,\u201d said Scott. He suggested platform boots in pumpkin orange, extra-oversize sweatshirts sewn through with even more oversize ruffles, graphic trope-y tees and spider-web-studded moto jackets.

The show was a little tough to see in the shadows, and the styling was as maxed out as it could be. What really resonated\u2014and thrilled\u2014was the popcorn smack of disruptiveness that Scott brought to the block. We live in a time where it\u2019s almost impossible to get noticed, or, somewhat counterintuitively, we don\u2019t know what will get noticed. Moschino is one of those brands where the viewer is mostly aware of what to anticipate, and this is where Scott so smartly surprised.

This season we cast more transpeople than ever before, and we wanted to show each one, give them a voice.\u201d Loweth and codesigner Tom Barratt said they meant to \u201ccut through the performance\u201d this time, but they still managed to stir up theatrical sensations of otherworldly angst using minimal devices. Barratt, who walked\u2014or rather, deliberately staggered\u2014in kitten heels and a strapless dress, is a member the PlayStation generation who formed an affectionate fascination for plunging through Silent Hill, the Japanese horror game launched in the 2000s. \u201cI think Silent Hill speaks a lot to the world today,\u201d said Barratt. \u201cFor queer people it can often be a battle and scary, mentally intense and almost dystopian.\u201d Thus, the repulsion of the pupil-less contact lenses, the instructions to participants to slow down the pace, and the fact that Loweth\u2019s childhood singer-songwriter idol, Anna Calvi, was playing her guitar live at the end of the runway, standing in the ritualistic circle of salt. For all the creepsome emotional atmosphere, the staging was also a deliberately courageous act to cut out frenetic action and slow it down so that critical audience gaze had to linger on every individual and their look\u2014the long silver shimmery coin-pailletted gowns, the button-through \u201cnurse\u201d dresses, the tight leopard-spotted painted leather cocktail minis, and the cut of the brown Lurex tailoring. It paid off: The collection was very together, well-edited, and as punctuated with tailoring (like sober jackets minimally knife-slashed in the back) as it was with sparkly party gowns. Loweth and Barratt are a highly responsible pair who nurture and represent the nonbinary community of all ages and shapes in London through the public space of fashion shows. \u201cWe are voices for this community\u2014that was bestowed on us; we didn\u2019t seek it,\u201d said Barratt. \u201cBut this is our work.

Nevertheless, their expertise in fitting trans bodies is a market opportunity in itself, Loweth says, picking out the example of bustier tops \u201cwhich are cut on the bias, so a trans body can be comfortable.\u201d The designers have also worked out grading systems in which an identical dress can be cut to fit a man or a woman\u2014or whatever the customer identifies with in between."}, {"Designer": "Saint Laurent", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Ever since Anthony Vaccarello landed at Saint Laurent in 2016\u2014in fact, even before, with his own label\u2014he has always had a preference for staging his shows so that the audience sits on only one side of the runway, giving an uninterrupted view of the unfolding spectacle. For his Summer 2020 men\u2019s show, his second for the house after last June\u2019s \u201970s opium-fest in NYC, it was business as usual, if it\u2019s possible to call staging a show on an ebonized boardwalk runway atop a Malibu beach usual. (Nope, obviously not, not even for the likes of Keanu Reeves, LaKeith Stanfield, and Miley Cyrus, who sat front row.) More on why California in a minute, but what did that uninterrupted view of the clothes tell us? That Vaccarello, who barely tackled menswear prior to arriving at Saint Laurent, save for his brief stint at Versus, is a quick study. This was a strong and assured outing from him, connecting to some of that YSL legend of old, but also with his own unerring sense of what a young guy might actually want to wear today. The major starting point for the collection, Vaccarello said at a preview, was Marrakech in the \u201970s (YSL was a habitu\u00e9e) reimagined as 21st-century Los Angeles, a city that resides on Vaccarello\u2019s own emotional landscape. (He first visited when he was 14, and there have been many return visits.) While that\u2019s some geographical leap, it\u2019s not an unimaginable one; both locations speak to a yearning for a certain bohemian, free-spirited, almost mystical escape. \u201cYou come to L.A. for vacation,\u201d Vaccarello said. \u201cYou can disconnect from the rest of the world.\u201d The Morocco-by-way-of-LA-isms were smartly and sparingly deployed throughout the collection and considered flourishes, not theme-gone-wild. The tasseled hoods, djellaba shirting, and embroideries of tiny silver discs suspended from chains amplified the rigor of the classic YSL vestiaire that Vaccarello has been busy exploring (the saharienne, the sharp-as-a-tack tux) as well as the kind of pieces (the bomber, the spencer) that he has introduced into the house\u2019s lexicon. At a time when men\u2019s tailoring is coming back with a vengeance, there was plenty of it here that intrigued, including jackets whose shoulder seams ran on the bias, keeping the line defined, but, apparently, allowing for more comfort and mobility. After all, how else might you convince a generation accustomed to the freedom of streetwear to try tailoring on for the first time\u2014and keep it on? The other major reference for the collection was Mick Jagger, circa the Rolling Stones tour of 1975, where the lead singer got to shake a tail feather onstage (and off) in all sorts of glossy and glittery finery. Vaccarello understands, as Jagger did, that a man never looks more masculine than when he\u2019s in satin and sparkle. So he took the opportunity to reference the androgyny of the glam-slam \u201970s with one that reflects today: the gleaming black teddy jacket whose sleeves were cut with kimono-like proportions, for instance, or an ivory satin suit, which came with a matching silk shirt left undone save for the knot at the waist. (Jagger, incidentally, who gave Vaccarello access to his vintage YSL, is returning the compliment by wearing some pieces from this collection when the Stones start their U.S. tour later this month, including the cobalt blue-to-black d\u00e9grad\u00e9 beaded blouson.) Some of the gender fluidity came in less-expected forms. The shorts, which have been a mainstay of his women\u2019s collections from the very beginning, made their men\u2019s debut, as ragged denim cut-offs paired with a lean pinstriped jacket or an oversize trench. The blown-up proportions of the latter underscored the softer, looser\u2014sensual, even\u2014approach Vaccarello took here. It was a first for him, an indication he\u2019s finding his comfort level with his men\u2019s while also being able to dig in and challenge himself. \u201cI love it now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might sound selfish to say this, but I really project myself into the pieces. I\u2019m trying everything on.\u201d Even, he said, the finale looks, a terrific line-up of super-wide, super-fluid black pants, in gauzy knit or a crushed pleated silk, billowing and flowing from a high and often belted waist. Vaccarello showed them as the gray-skied swelling Pacific Ocean finally slid into darkness, but it looked a whole lot more like him seeing things in a new light."}, {"Designer": "NIHL", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Due to the ever-expanding menswear season, I wasn\u2019t in New York to watch Nihl\u2019s models slink around Nowhere Bar in New York\u2014I was about 7,000 miles away in Shanghai for Prada\u2019s Spring 2020 runway of innocents. At a preview for Neil Grotzinger\u2019s Spring 2020 collection, the designer explained his myriad references, starting with bar culture and the link between hetero and queer masculinity. Hence the venue he chose on East 14th Street, the sort of grimy spot where you could imagine downing some Heinekens alongside Pride flags and twinkling Christmas lights. Grotzinger thrives in the contradictory space of queer masculinity, exploring the areas where masc meets femme, hardcore meets tenderness. He\u2019s only been at it for three seasons since graduating Parsons\u2019s MFA program, but he\u2019s already built a recognizable oeuvre: pelvis-baring trousers, second-skin tops with suggestive cutouts, and rigorous handiwork like beading and chain mail. Spring 2020 is his most evolved and sure-footed collection yet. The stretch tops and trousers with circular chunks removed remain, but Grotzinger has expanded into leather, offering uniform-inspired jackets and V-front trousers. Those plunging fronts might seem untenable for real-world wear, but as the designer demo\u2019ed, he\u2019s calculated the exact curve that allows the pants to cantilever around the lower body, staying put even while slightly unzipped. There is also a large group of shirting, with banker stripes meeting up with homoerotic portrayals of cowboys and car culture. Grotzinger ran the shirts through a sewing machine willy-nilly to create corset seams that run around the body, front to back, tugging the fabric off the shoulder here, revealing a collarbone there. In a variety of shapes and patterns, these have instant hanger appeal. The most beautifully kinky of Grotzinger\u2019s creations are the flight suits, rendered useless\u2014or at least useless for pilots\u2014by zippers or hook-and-eye closures that circle the body. Equal parts Leigh Bowery and Evel Knievel, these are perfectly strange summations of Grotzinger\u2019s MO: fetishizing functionality from a queer POV. These might not be the most salable of his offering, but much else of what appears in this lookbook surely warrants a spot at retail. As yet, only one shop carries Nihl. If the menswear season is big enough to warrant trips halfway round the world, surely its stores are big enough to carry this daring young designer."}, {"Designer": "Prada", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "\u201cI am no longer an artist; I have become a work of art,\u201d spoke a voiceover in the middle of Prada\u2019s Spring 2020 men\u2019s show, held, for the first time off home turf, in Shanghai. (Typically Miuccia Prada prefers to show her collections in the Fondazione Prada in Milan or at her New York office.) Later, the same voice said, \u201cI feel myself a god.\u201d Mrs. Prada has long maintained a reverent relationship with art, supporting and collaborating with her favorite creators, without ever formally declaring herself among their ranks\u2014no word on the god situation. So, what were we to make of the statements pronounced, at techno speed, over a blue-lit runway at the Minsheng Art Wharf? To those at home in the Pradaverse, the words, lifted from Frankie Goes to Hollywood\u2019s Welcome to the Pleasuredome, were Prada subversion at its best. In the show notes\u2014unlike her in situ shows, Mrs. P did not assemble journalists for a debrief\u2014the collection was described as one of optimism, suggesting that being hopeful can be an antidote for accepting the darkness of our actuality. It\u2019s a continuation of the themes she launched at her recent women\u2019s Resort show in New York, but when presented on male models, it took on a kinkier edge. The girlishness and sweetness of those paillette scarves and embroidered shirts were replaced with an almost erotic purity\u2014the idea of fetishizing a thing as perfect as it is, unadorned in simple cotton or loose leather. The clothes were essentials in the most classic sense of menswear\u2014twills, tweeds, shirting, sportswear, khaki\u2014but oversize or misplaced in their proportion to reveal, say, a bare collarbone in a baby doll\u2013ish tank, or to accentuate the strangeness of wearing a cropped jacket over a blazer in the same material. Together the looks comprised all the musts of a traditional male wardrobe, recut with the freewheeling spirit of boyhood. But a Prada show is never one note. The stated reason for this Shanghai show was to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Milan being named a sister city of the Chinese cosmopolis. The reality is that business in China is booming. Over two days of touring the city\u2019s hubs, it was impossible to miss a Prada store or billboard. In reviving its Linea Rossa business, the company has struck gold with a younger, more streetwear-inclined consumer. Perhaps that\u2019s what gave birth to a series of prints of antiquated technology. A roll of film here, a cassette tape there, a \u201850s soda-pop joint milkshake later on\u2014all of these pieces appeared as a single graphic or as a grid of many on trendy nylon. As the models walked past an audience clad in last season\u2019s Frankenstein-patterned pieces, you could see the commercial appeal. To be sinister, or sales-minded, though, is not the larger message. Zoom all the way out\u2014like, decades of menswear out\u2014and this collection could read as a pivotal moment for Prada. For a long time, its menswear shows were about a medium-rise straight pant, a button-up polo shirt, and a loose anorak. Since hitting commercial success with pop-worthy printed camp shirts, Mrs. P has dared to design well beyond her menswear signatures, producing short-shorts and tightly belted blazers, and now loose tanks and shorts with zippers up the side seam. It\u2019s a real treat to see her explore proportion and intention in menswear with the same pointedness she brings to her women\u2019s shows. No wonder the guests in Shanghai went wild."}, {"Designer": "Astrid Andersen", "Season": "Men's Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Before streetwear was a billion-dollar business buzzword there was Astrid Anderson, who built her label adapting her American sport obsessions into oversize and graphic-laden menswear. Now that her aesthetic has become the norm, Andersen is stepping back and reevaluating her signatures, repositioning her brand within the oversaturated street market. What she\u2019s come up with over the past couple of seasons is a slower, more sentimental approach to her clothing. It\u2019s at its best for Spring 2020, which might come as a surprise considering she is not showing on the runway, as she has for the past five years, nor is she showing in her adopted fashion homeland of London Fashion Week Men\u2019s. Instead Andersen held press previews for her Spring 2020 collection in stylist Simon Rasmussen\u2019s studio on New York\u2019s Canal Street, where an Australian shepherd milled about as photographers and assistants prepped the lookbook shoot. There, Andersen showed off a concise two racks of menswear that honed in on her brand DNA. It was tightly edited, in a sand and sky palette, offering one or two ur-options of her key pieces. Her graphic jersey, for example, is upgraded in a silky tone-on-tone leopard print, while tracksuits and basketball shorts are in nylon or trimmed with seam tape for a more technical feel. To amplify her less-but-better message, Andersen created several of her go-to silhouettes, from anoraks to cargo pants, in organza. Each piece is entirely made by hand, with her and her studio team dying the thread and fabric over and over again until they hit the perfect shade of Dutch blue. These organza pieces are near couture grade, lovingly labored over with a bit of built-in soul.

The front rooms had been converted into an approximation of a rich kid\u2019s bedroom, the character Millar chose to develop this season: a privileged prep school kid with a sensitive soul and creative leanings, of the kind that is commonly seen in the fashion industry. \u201cIt\u2019s very odd, I know, as an inspiration,\u201d he explained of his choice. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that I\u2019m celebrating privilege. I\u2019m more talking about how much weight that puts on a character that is much more creative and can\u2019t uphold the expectations of that structure.\u201d Millar blended classic prep design cues with softer artistic motifs in several ways. Think, a minimalist version of a cream cricket sweater, crossed simply with black stripes and paired with penny loafers, themselves playfully embellished with puka shells. A Marini\u00e8re tank top, created in collaboration with Breton, bore simplified white horse ribbons on the chest, while additional equestrian elements could be seen on pieces like a cool spandex mock-neck printed with saddle bags and silver feed buckets. There was a nice range of items on display, both in terms of wearability and price point.

There\u2019s been a bat mitzvah, a supper club performance by Janelle Mon\u00e1e (with an invite stating a black-and-white dress code, no less), and a moving gospel choir performance inside one of Brooklyn\u2019s oldest, most storied theaters. Some on the circuit are already ringing the death knell for the traditional runway show format, and frankly, the differentiation has helped spice things up on the newly condensed calendar. Private Policy, a label based between Shanghai and New York from Chinese designers Haoran Li and Siying Qu, did the same, opting to show their Spring 2020 unisex label with a live model presentation at a SoHo gallery alongside a series of portraits photographed by Shxpir Huang. After Fashion Week, the space will turn into a pop-up shop. The images feature real Asian-American families who all styled themselves in the latest Private Policy lineup, which includes their signature checkered pattern applied to the lapels of baby pink and seafoam green skirt- and short-suit sets. There were cool, raver-esque harness tops and ring-detailed slip dresses, along with Li and Qu\u2019s usual streetwear tees. They\u2019ve titled their collection \u201cFamily Dinner,\u201d and the idea was to highlight the often emotionally intense experience of an Asian-American family gathering around food. More forward-thinking youth will sometimes clash with the elders who are tied to their generational, conservative ideologies. The portraits of the families are meant to showcase just how varied Asian-American families can be: They can have older kids, both the mother and father can work, or two Asian men can get married and start their own family together. That last example is of great importance to Li and Qu, as they want to challenge gender bias and LGBTQ discrimination in their own culture, both at home and in America. But speaking of America, there was something that distracted from all of the positive and hopeful photographs that Li and Qu spoke about yesterday. Placed on a pedestal table in the middle of the gallery space, as those happy families looked on, were two of Private Policy\u2019s \u201cgun bags\u201d: little clip-on bags that resembled gun holsters. Considering that Asian Americans\u2014and all Americans\u2014are in the midst of a gun-control crisis and a spike in mass shootings, the design, however accidental, was ill-advised. The young designers are still sorting out their place and position in the fashion industry, and they\u2019d be wise to make absolutely sure that their inspiring message is consistent across the board.

Still, the designer found fresh inspiration in those staid signposts. Though the idea of reworked British classics has been done to death, Obana executed his version precisely enough that it still came through clearly as N.Hoolywood. A spare presentation unfolded at the BMCC Tribeca Performing Arts Center, a shoebox theater that was left pitch black, save for four central spotlights. To the sounds of Beethoven, models walked out one by one and stood briefly before the audience, a somewhat performative show that referenced the installations Obana first created when he started, 18 seasons ago. Given the twist on British fashion, one saw all the usual tropes: trench coats and schoolboy shorts and pinstripe suits, as well as a punky red plaid, which Obana had pulled from Undercover designer Jun Takahashi\u2019s archive. (A special tag read \u201cRebel Print by Undercover.\u201d) Obana also created a graphic of pharmaceutical pills, which could have read as a tired reference to punk drug culture, but it actually came from an oddly pleasing spam email that reminded Obana of English artist Damien Hirst\u2019s 1992 \u201cPharmacy\u201d installation, and helped make it his own."}, {"Designer": "Celine", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Part of Hedi Slimane\u2019s power as an artistic director is his concision: the ability with a mere few pieces to overhaul not just a brand, but also large swaths of fashion. Presented in Paris in July amidst the haute couture shows, this pre-collection was as succinct as the showroom in which it was housed was vast. The Celine look is a boyishly cut blazer, a ruffle-neck button-down, a pair of high-waisted flared jeans, and deceptively humble white trainers, as efficient\u2014and sophisticated\u2014as a code. Labels up and down the market will try to crack it. That said, Slimane is also a completist, and no detail is too small to merit his attention, as the exacting decor of the house\u2019s first-ever parfumerie, recently unveiled on Paris\u2019s Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9, suggests. Here, he turned his eye to delicate ID bracelets and even daintier chain necklaces and stud earrings. Note the gold frames on the aviator shades the models wear in more than half of the pictures, a millimeter or two thicker than the other guys\u2019 sunglasses.

Gvasalia is the rare designer today engaging with sociopolitical issues and moving serious amounts of merch. This Resort collection was presented in the Balenciaga showroom during the July couture shows. It lacked the imposing set, haunting soundtrack, and facial prosthetics that made the recent show so potent, but it bears all the hallmarks of Gvasalia\u2019s clever renovation of this historical house, among them: outsize parkas with their cheekbone-grazing collars; easy-wearing printed tea dresses; a surfeit of souvenir prints, not just on those tea dresses but also on shell suits, pajama sets, and stirrup leggings; and inventive, essentially unisex tailoring, this time double-breasted and often lapel-less. The look-book-opening coat is stamped with the Balenciaga logo in the familiar block print, but even without it fashion people could identify the sloping shoulders, buttoned collar, and boxy, exaggerated fit as signature Gvasalia. It\u2019s big enough to wear a Balenciaga suit underneath it, and that\u2019s a real-world application of so-called power dressing if ever there were one. Gvasalia uses these preseason collections as an opportunity to pump up Balenciaga\u2019s accessories; his runways are refreshingly light on handbags compared to those of other labels. Here he showed the label\u2019s popular phone-holder bags with reusable water bottles, which is arguably a better use for them now that we\u2019ve hit peak plastic. And could he do for bedroom slippers what he did for dad sneakers? Just possibly, yes. The look book concludes on a V-neck dress, simple save its silver foil fabric, the same silver foil fabric that Gvasalia used for a showstopper of a Spring 2020 gown that nods back at the house\u2019s couture past.

Looking internally, Mouret has been auditing his business, whittling down the options he shows wholesale buyers. Doing too much, trying to please everyone, is a slippery slope to losing focus anyway, he says. \u201cWe calculated the overflow, analyzed the spec sheets, reduced it down.\u201d As someone who can look down the long perspective of history, it\u2019s a return to resourcefulness, which hardly feels unnatural. \u201cIt\u2019s what we all did in the \u201990s,\u201d he laughs. \u201cWhen we had nothing!\u201d That\u2019s one way to regain a grip on his identity as a brand\u2014less waste, more rationality, concentrating on what contemporary women might need after years of excessive consumption. Meanwhile, Mouret is using his platform to champion an aspect of progress on a peer-to-peer basis. He was eager to draw attention to the Blue Arch & Hook hangers, a trademarked brand made entirely from recycled marine plastics, which the Resort clothes were displayed on. Diverting the fashion industry away from the single-use hangers that are currently used in the transportation of clothes\u2014unseen by consumers\u2014is a solution he\u2019s actively championing through a campaign partnered by The British Fashion Council. It\u2019s a no-brainer for anyone who\u2019s waking up to the fact that 85% of plastic hangers go into landfills, he says. \u201cWe can all do this, and clean up the ocean too,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that makes me happy.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Rachel Comey", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Poof!

Making the point most clearly was a baggy suit in tan, trimmed with gold foil. Meanwhile, in her most casual looks, Comey\u2019s puckishness expressed itself through an embrace of the tacky\u2014colored acid-wash denim was a big theme here, and years from now, when someone mounts a museum show exploring hipster camp, it will surely include Comey\u2019s lipstick red vinyl jumpsuit, precisely the kind of Mudd Club\u2013era thing a certain girl digs out of a thrift shop bin and wears ironically/not ironically.

To Marysia\u2019s superfans, picking up a scalloped-edge bikini or maillot in one of those fresh new colors might be enough to satisfy their pre-vacation cravings in November. But there were more noteworthy surprises here, particularly in the ready-to-wear offering. In the past, Reeves\u2019s dresses were quite casual and beachy, often toeing the line between a \u201creal dress\u201d and a swim coverup. Her Resort options felt significantly elevated: A few cotton dresses came with full, A-line skirts and high necklines, while others had cute nautical collars and lace-up detailing. She also introduced her first bona fide \u201ccocktail dress\u201d: a luminous coral silk column with a ruffly collar and bands of smocking throughout.

Can you even imagine being in a bad mood in Resort 2020\u2019s watercolor ball skirt? What about the emerald silk gown covered in white flowers? Part of the fun is that an Assoulin piece has gleeful surprises built in: That floral dress wasn\u2019t a jacquard or a pattern, but was actually screen-printed; the ink gave it a dry, pleasantly stiff texture. And that watercolor? Hand-painted by Assoulin herself. It\u2019s ostensibly easier to dial up the fun factor when it comes to eveningwear, which is intended to make a statement (and has become Assoulin\u2019s calling card). In a way, that makes her low-key daywear pieces feel more noteworthy.

The mythology of the American West was one of her brother Gianni\u2019s enduring fascinations; in 1992 he made headlines with a collection featuring cowboys and cowgirls in studded black leather regalia, twisted with a transgressive nod to bondage. The frontier was an apt reference for his groundbreaking take-no-prisoners exploration of confident excess. \u201cFashion knows no boundaries or frontiers,\u201d she said via email.

They were all here in the Resort collection, filtered through a nod to pop culture and coalescing around an \u201880s-inspired structured silhouette. Versace tailoring is inherently assertive. For Resort, it was anchored by broad padded shoulders and accented with knotted bandanna-inspired printed-silk foulards. Elsewhere those bandannas morphed into a series of asymmetrical printed-silk slip dresses cinched at the waist by studded black leather belts. Sporty bombers with denim inserts were made in chocolate-color suede, introducing an element of tactile softness; a similar sensual feel graced a series of camel wrap-around blanket coats and ponchos with printed-silk lining and fringed hem. Prints being one of the house\u2019s defining visual ingredients, they were lavishly displayed in tie-dye, animalier, or curlicued Western Barocco patterns on bodycon silk dresses and daywear separates. Counterbalancing this head-spinning visual abundance, black dresses were a standout, offered in a great variety of shapes from fluid, asymmetrical numbers to more structured and sexy versions, with heart-shaped necklines and \u201880s shoulders. On a touching note, Gianni Versace\u2019s original handwritten signature was transformed into a new logo, which was either embroidered, all-over printed, or picked out with Swarovski crystals. But there\u2019s no place for nostalgia in the house of Versace; Donatella\u2019s eyes are set on the present. \u201cThe Versace woman has her feet firmly planted on living the moment and in real life,\u201d she said. She definitely practices what she preaches. Her recent appearance in New York alongside Lady Gaga to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the uprising at the Stonewall Inn was testament to her personal involvement on the issues that matter most today."}, {"Designer": "A.W.A.K.E.

There was also a sprinkling of the \u201970s in the tall pointed collar shape on some pieces. Square-toed shoes in lurid colors and one-leg-white, the-other-leg-black leggings played against her signature bold draping in exaggerated asymmetrical tops. The structure of a split-section gingham skirt, deconstructable via button, was echoed in a multi-vented coat. Square quilted bags in different shades of pleather and elongated shapes had, especially in black, a vaguely mace-like menace. Alaverdian staples such as her pant-skirt (which she disturbingly termed a \u201cpirt\u201d) made a return, as did her talent for languorously attractive draping. Standouts included a split-skirt dress in yellow crepe with soft dunes of gather in the body and a shirt-fronted black satin top that could be worn with total propriety or the implication of a loss of it via straps at the back."}, {"Designer": "Dice Kayek", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Dice Kayek\u2019s Ece Ege doesn\u2019t do girly\u2014the mere mention of the word makes her cringe. Neither does she do sexy, the idea of which induces a rolling of the eyes in mock despair. Also: Her color palette is always implacably restricted to navy, black, and white. So it was somewhat surprising to see the Parisian showroom where the Resort collection was shown bursting with bright fuchsias, oranges, and emerald greens, and resplendent with brocade, silk gazar, silk duchesse, and mousseline. What happened? \u201cI always love a good challenge,\u201d was Ege\u2019s ready answer. The designer hails from Turkey, and lives between Paris and Istanbul. References to her Ottoman culture were distilled in her penchant for structure and construction, and perceptible this season not only in the use of vibrant hues, but also in a more sensuous and joyful approach to shapes and silhouettes. Cases in point were ballerina dresses in bright, saturated colors swinging with triumphs of ruffles. A tunic in liquid white silk satin printed with black roses was draped sinuously around the body, and a billowy caftan in silk organza was printed with humongous emerald polka dots. It looked spectacular: \u201cIt\u2019s djellaba couture,\u201d said Ege. Inspired by traditional Turkish dowries, exquisite floral motifs were reprised on a shirtdress in sheer white cotton organza with puff sleeves and a ruched short skirt. Ege showed it with a matching mini slipdress made with origami-like folds, which could also be worn as a minidress or paired with jeans.

That opens up a lot of new possibilities, fabrics- and logistics-wise, and Ellery is clearly having fun mixing things up, pairing crinkled, fine-knit canary sleeves with a beige fabric overcoat, for example. She used the same color scheme to make a case for the return of the stirrup pant (it also comes in black faux leather) and turned it sideways on a horizontally striped dress trimmed in fringe with a lashing of rhinestones. Playing with shine is another one of Ellery\u2019s loves: She has a burgeoning jewelry line (the metallic daisy bra will probably travel to fashion shoots all over the place) and has just developed metallic rhinestone pulls for her \u201970s-inspired separates. Elsewhere, she seized on a piece of op art from her childhood bedroom, transposing it onto a wide metallic wave on an oversized blush pantsuit. If Ellery\u2019s base relies on her for any one thing, it\u2019s statement-making tops. This season, the designer delivered with Renaissance-worthy shoulders that were held up with chunky metallic chains\u2014complete with a corset belt and finer chains at the waist\u2014or cascaded into her signature elongated sleeves.

There was a lot of linen, a fabric that, while applauded for its cooling effects, is often perceived as old-timey. Teng gave it a modern update by mashing together different textures: using it in a lam\u00e9 form, like on a boyish tank top, and applying it as the stripe on a long sheer skirt. On one blue clingy jersey dress with a stellar drape\u2014which can also be tied into a slouchy top\u2014striped linen was inserted as a slice across the boat neck. Something else that should be mentioned about Teng is how well she cuts fabric. One example of this was a flag dress that had a slit only on one side. It seems like an arbitrary choice, but Teng explained that the singular slit wouldn\u2019t disrupt the stripe or reveal the white skirt it was sitting on top of. While the collection may skew older in terms of silhouette, Teng\u2019s approach has never been more important.

This included the floral motifs\u2014from faded and wallpaper-esque roses to brighter bouquets; as allover looks, they had an edgy ingenue slant. The oversize Perfecto with hand-braided fringe, arguably the collection\u2019s hero piece, was made from organic, nondyed cotton with hand-braided fringe. Did Powney feel constrained by such a limited range of materials? \u201cI am a logical designer; I love designing for a reason,\u201d she explained. \u201cI like having boundaries and designing within them. And actually I have designed better since I started doing that.\u201d She noted too the limits beyond her control: Velvet, she noted, is impossible to do sustainably, and all those pearly bits in the No Frills diffusion line remain plastic. \u201cTrims are a slow market,\u201d she said. \u201cBut 99 percent of clothing is the fabric, so we can focus on that first.\u201d If it\u2019s natural to feel conflicted about enjoying fashion despite the industry\u2019s colossal issues, both collections take a committed, non-proselytizing approach through designs that carry a respectable, youthful flair."}, {"Designer": "Stella Jean", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Are women art curators a new breed of fashion influencers? They\u2019d probably cringe at the notion, yet their spirited, idiosyncratic take on style is hard to miss. Once inconspicuous-looking figures clad in nondescript frocks, blurred in the background behind world-class artists, women museum directors today have wardrobes as well-curated as the exhibitions and art projects they put on. Fascinated by their cool, cultivated approach to fashion, Stella Jean called her Resort collection the Curator, referencing three powerhouses of the contemporary art world: Thelma Golden, the Studio Museum in Harlem director and chief curator; Maria Balshaw, London\u2019s Tate museums director; and the Cameroonian-born cultural producer Koyo Kouoh, who founded the Dakar-based Raw Material Company. Topping the list was the not-necessarily contemporary, but decidedly legendary Peggy Guggenheim. Jean\u2019s attitude toward inclusivity comes from her biracial upbringing; she\u2019s always keen on opening up the creative spectrum, involving artists or fellow designers to collaborate on her collections. This season she enlisted the Italian artist Marina Tabacco, who spent most of her life in Senegal, to create Dakar, a vibrant abstract-stroke pattern. It was printed on easy shirtdresses and on crisp poplin shirts paired with pareo skirts tied on the hips, a recurring shape referencing Jean\u2019s Haitian mother\u2019s easy wrap-dressing gestures. The artsy spirit was obviously a pervasive note throughout the collection. A multi-colored pre-Colombian pattern graced a floor-sweeping tiered skirt, while a red-and-white geometric design had a primitivist flavor. When patterns so joyful and dense do the talking, shapes should be simple and easy, peppered with just the right amount of playfulness. These took the form of a printed, hourglass-shaped blazer worn with matching cropped leggings and a striped shirt-tunic ruched on the sides.

Patterns were reworked around the idea of metamorphosis, with hybrid creatures\u2014a winged cheetah, a leo-rhino, and a horse with rooster\u2019s feathers\u2014gracing silk twill shirts paired with pleated kilts and sporty parkas. The same motifs were printed on shirts in the men\u2019s collection. The Cavalli menagerie of leopards, zebras, and giraffes appeared on billowy chiffon caftans and loose trench coats worn with bias-cut slip dresses while a kaleidoscopic sunburst design was inspired by a chameleon\u2019s skin. The evening\u2019s offering was consistent with the house\u2019s codes, with sequined and embellished numbers exuding glamour aplenty. The menswear referenced the \u201980s in its relaxed tailoring volumes and bold colors while elongated and sleek silhouettes were reminiscent of the \u201990s, with animalier jacquards adding an exotic touch.

Ditto the turquoise and Yves Klein blue of a crocodile clutch and tote bag, respectively. The accent on color could be down to the label\u2019s newly launched e-commerce site. Brights play well online, much as prints do. Black and other dark shades tend to read as flat; on those colors, it\u2019s difficult for details to register on computer and phone screens. Surface details were another preoccupation for the designers this time around. See the ivory silk evening tunic, hand-embroidered in white and yellow threads, and the profusion of tiny pleats on a floor-length dress. Mostly, though, this offering found the designers focused on tailoring and shirting. The Row\u2019s menswear has been selling in stores for nearly a year, and it looks as though they\u2019ve applied some of the rigor of their guy\u2019s suiting to the women\u2019s side.

But nostalgia for a time when sophisticated, carefree life was almost a fastidious art form is always a potent aphrodisiac for designers, so be it. Albino referenced the sense of elegance Aarons\u2019s images exuded; the lean, precisely cut couture-like volumes he favors would have been at home in one of Truman Capote\u2019s swans\u2019 wardrobes. Although he infused a modern, practical ease and breezy vibe into the collection, he stayed true to his architectural construction and tailored approach. Day dresses were standouts, offered either tiered, floor sweeping, and billowy, or cut like a masculine shirt in striped poplin with plays on asymmetries.

No surprise there. But this latest collection offered up some light and lively aspects too. The central motif, for instance, looked like scribbles created with colored markers\u2014playfully artistic and nonfigurative. Marant often likes a flash of metallic, and this season\u2019s silver blouses and boots made sure to signal \u201980s rock-star glam.

There was something noticeably right, as well, about the choice of model\u2014her androgynous presentation and seductive body language. Whether in the buttery yellow leather dress and lace tights or a turtleneck and rolled jeans, she was transmitting the type of directness that would speak to those who have always appreciated Marant\u2019s nongirly spin on the Parisienne. It\u2019s worth mentioning that when Marant speaks of dressed, she doesn\u2019t mean dressed up (the stretch-velour one-shoulder dress outlined in strass notwithstanding). Much of this lineup\u2014a long denim jacket lined with faux-rabbit fur, the draped floral dresses, the suits, and obviously those lipstick red boots\u2014consisted of statement pieces that, with little additional effort, could become a complete look.

Over the past few seasons, Valli has been testing his version of activewear without compromising the enchanting glamour for which he is best known. As befitting a Resort collection, the leisure-luxe swimsuits and caftans were back, now in even more ruffled, printed, and embroidered variations. A newer series of pajama-adjacent pieces\u2014breezy ensembles, shirts, shorts, and even a dressing gown, all detailed with piping and a GBV monogram\u2014were a clever extension of the category and will prove welcome for their off-duty ease. But because it would make sense (hopefully) that women who wear his frothy dresses also need work attire, he has further developed grisaille suit jackets that, in their own way, were the highlight of this collection. \u201cI can see Amal Clooney going to court,\u201d he quipped. In the iconic gray menswear fabric, the styles were sharp and shapely rather than boxy, with floral embroideries an uplifting antidote to any corporate setting. Indeed, flowers were just about everywhere in this lineup, even as metallic and beaded buds embroidered in the leather of the Flore bag. \u201cReal women love flower dresses, garden party dresses,\u201d he said. It\u2019s funny to hear Valli referring to real women given how his clientele has historically been comprised of rare birds. Whether or not the H&M collaboration has something to do with it, the fairy-tale aspect remains intrinsic to his approach, and the couture show will reiterate as much. But here in this Resort realm, when you see a tiered tulle skirt, it is quite likely to be paired with a fancy sweatshirt. One last point: New bejeweled zodiac minaudi\u00e8res prompted the question of Valli\u2019s sign.\u201cActually, it\u2019s my birthday tomorrow,\u201d he revealed. Joyeux anniversaire, GBV!

Blooming on minidresses in broderie anglaise or twirling around sleeves and across bodices, they were ubiquitous. The Spanish theme was also there in pantsuits with abbreviated embroidered jackets and cropped pants, referencing the slim silhouettes of toreadors, or else in leather minidresses, laser cut with motifs inspired by peinatas, traditional haircombs with ornate latticework. Silhouettes were either hourglass-y, sensuous, and body-con or more flowing and light; an \u201980s flair gave the collection a modern twist, as in a sleek black tuxedo with sharp-tailored shoulders and a sexy minidress heavily embellished with golden sequins."}, {"Designer": "Olivier Theyskens", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Walking into Olivier Theyskens\u2019s new studio in the 10th arrondissement is like stepping back in time, with a mosaic tile floor and silk wallpaper dating to the late 1800s.

He has his own vocabulary. Having established traditional hook and eyes as a visual motif, this season Theyksens went in big for chrome hardware. Bias-cut swaths of silk are suspended from a single substantial hook below the neck; the resulting dress is a sexy wisp of a thing. Elsewhere, oversize hook and eyes fasten corsets with unique scoop necklines. There\u2019s an erotic undercurrent to the new collection, but it\u2019s commanding, not weak or submissive. Take, for example, the tailored jackets he cut with bras built into the lapels. They\u2019re designed to be worn shirtless, but the bra could also be worn undone over a blouse or tee. \u201cThen it just looks like she\u2019s wearing a vest underneath,\u201d he explained.

One couldn\u2019t help but see a parallel between the designer\u2019s newly accelerated schedule and her muse this season. For Resort, Hanley has conjured a fantasist who lives in an enormous loft, never leaving but always dreaming. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t actually go anywhere,\u201d Hanley says, making her muse\u2019s trips more like mental vacations than excursions to the far-flung destinations the Resort season is named for. Operating on the indie fringes of fashion with the time and space to daydream is a luxury Hanley has enjoyed so far, but one she might not be able to maintain for long. That\u2019s not a bad thing. As she thumbed through her collection, made primarily from upholstery fabrics she sourced in the Garment District, she said that Resort is an attempt at a balance between the hand-done, homespun pieces she loves to make and more commercial options. In the former category are imaginative knits, slashed and dyed with a carefree abandon. If a patched-together bustier made in Pepto pink is a little inconceivable, even for the daydreamers out there, a long-sleeved sweater in gradient dyes seems ready for wintry layering. As for the more salable items, Haney collaborated with artist Andrew Gonzalez on a graphic tee and has cut a white column dress in stretch fabric with raw edges that is as close to minimalist as she\u2019ll go. Finding the balance between the commercial and quirky seems easy enough for the young designer, who glitzed everything up with a new jewelry line made in partnership with her friend Aurelia Cotton. With fleur-de-lis charms and crystals, the line is inspired by a recent trip to New Orleans.

He\u2019s dispatched photographer Daniel Arnold to the streets of Milan solo with a model; he\u2019s had his editor friends lensed in their favorites outfits, and he\u2019s asked the Swedish performer and women\u2019s rights activist Arvida Bystr\u00f6m to take artistic selfies. Last season, it was the flamboyant Paris-based stylist Catherine Baba\u2019s turn to pose in Berardi\u2019s not-for-wallflowers looks. For Resort, he appointed British photographer Derek Ridgers, famous for his stark portraits of punks, skinheads, musicians, and club kids, to shoot the 17-year-old British trans model Finn Buchanan, who recently walked the binary-blurring Spring 2019 Maison Margiela show and was cast by Hedi Slimane in his first men\u2019s show for Celine. \u201cHe was wonderful, poetic and lithe, almost angelic,\u201d said Berardi of Buchanan, who personally chose the clothes he wanted to be photographed in. \u201cWhat\u2019s most interesting in this lookbook is that it has taken certain aspects of what I do into new territory,\u201d continued the designer. \u201cFinn owned all the looks, whether feminine in their approach or masculine in their execution.\u201d Gender blurring is the fashion topic du jour, as the Spring 2020 men\u2019s collections that just closed in Paris proved fairly enough. The open exploration of male sexuality and masculine self-expression, easing somehow into feminine territory, has become one of the most fertile, emotionally profound narratives of the decade. \u201cThe young are really writing history,\u201d speculated Berardi. \u201cThey can be non-binary, transgender, male-to-female, and vice-versa, and they can live in their bodies and be who they want to be. Finn is a boy, but there will always be that feminine aspect to him. It\u2019s part of who he is. Stereotypes are completely going out the window.\u201d With awareness and support for LGBTQIA+ communities spreading across the industry and society, Berardi\u2019s stance felt not only sensitive but utterly on point. The collection exuded a gentle, fluid feel; the designer took a decidedly softer route than usual, swapping the architectural edge he favors for a smoother, almost breezy approach. Lines and shapes had clarity and, as always chez Berardi, sophisticated execution; yet a sense of unrestricted movement was conspicuous in the use of sheer, airy fabrications and in looser, more relaxed proportions. Even corsetry was given a breath of lightness, with flimsy organza ribbons laced across the back of a simple yet well-tailored short jacket. Elsewhere, the \u201cshadow of a corset,\u201d as the designer described it, was patched at the front of a floral-printed chiffon dress, with a billowy asymmetrical train. The same unconstrained spirit was conveyed by a marigold yellow floral-printed minidress, cut from a square of d\u00e9vor\u00e9 chiffon and gathered loosely at the hips. \u201cPeople today don\u2019t want to be restricted,\u201d said Berardi. \u201cNeither in their clothes nor in their sexuality.\u201d It couldn\u2019t be truer."}, {"Designer": "For Restless Sleepers", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Behind her reserved, elegant demeanor, Francesca Ruffini hides a love for the magical and the mysterious, which filters into the iconography of her sumptuous prints.

Ruffini gave a bold twist to her sophisticated graphics, shying away from the romantic representations she has so far favored and introducing a more assertive energy into the patterns. Blown-up flowers or waterfalls became like curlicued paint strokes on an emerald green caftan, and herons looked almost like menacing shadows over a sunset ablaze with red and yellow clouds. Willowy silhouettes inspired by Ren\u00e9 Gruau\u2019s drawings dissolved into ethereal outlined abstractions, and black-and-white stripes mingled with an exotic menagerie wandering in a jungle. An 18th-century gravure was juxtaposed with humongous red blooms. Colors were vibrant and often used in d\u00e9grad\u00e9 on long shirtdresses or trapeze caftans. The easy sophistication of FRS\u2019s signature pajama sets was complemented by jumpsuits, palazzo pants as ample as a circle skirt, and loose-fitting shirts paired with ankle-grazing skirts with an elasticized waistband for comfort.

It has all the makings of a fashion case study. A fiercely independent woman, Rykiel built a small empire on her own attitude, one that became known as la d\u00e9mode, or dressing down. By right, that qualifier alone should give the house enough latitude to stake out its turf in the Paris landscape today. With no one officially designated at the helm, the design studio had to hit the ground running and turn out a Resort collection in record time. They kept the inspiration simple, taking cues from Madame Rykiel herself\u2014a woman who grew up in one of the toniest neighborhoods in Paris, knew all the conventional rules, and then proceeded to break them precisely at the time the city was taking to the street, in May 1968. The parallels between then and now are readily apparent. The collection gamely ticked a lot of Rykiel\u2019s boxes. The striped knits and inside-out seams for which the designer became beloved were here; the stripes even mingle with chains on knit handbags. Rock T-shirts paired with slouchy trousers and skirts; shirts and trenches were extrapolated from vintage prints. Balloon sleeves and dropped shoulders nodded to the designer\u2019s \u201980s heyday, as did the color palette reprising the bleu, blanc, et rouge of the French flag, as well as Rykiel\u2019s favorite color, black.

Ordinarily, a shirt in pale lilac or almond green or an outfit in electric blue would not seem newsworthy. Here, they counted for something. But they had nothing on the gorgeous Black Label pieces that depicted the lunar phases\u2014a poetic union of vision and technique, with no two garments identical. The antique green and faded gray versions resulted from a traditional box-dyeing technique applied to a velvet devor\u00e9. Also from the Black Label was denim as interesting as any you\u2019d find from a high-visibility brand. Here, stitching had been deliberately untreated so that when the white denim was washed, the yarn color bled at all the edges, creating a subtle watery effect. Within the Pink Label, two ideas had been revived from the archives: the angel wings hand-dyed and airbrushed onto the backs of garments in Fuji silk (softer and more fluid, apparently), and a swirling floral motif that was adapted from a china design\u2014can\u2019t you just see the original plate or vase?

While the specificities of each are clearest to those who work at Y\u2019s, the combined takeaway is that these collections felt young in attitude yet salable across a wide age range.

Wardrobe archetypes\u2014gray suit, a trench, a tuxedo, her standby MA1 jacket\u2014all figured in this new exercise, which gave the impression of a more dressed-up lineup, even if each look registered the same swingy nonchalance as always. Two of the highlights came right at the start: the tuxedo shirt and pants fused into a roomy dress, undone bow tie included, followed by the reworkings of suit jackets and shirts. Some looks were tied together based on proportions; see the mini MA1 vest over an inside-out jacket or doubled-up denim jackets. Interestingly, the looks embellished with sequins gave off the same trace of grunge as some of the more obvious sun-struck flannels and mountaineering pants that were made in collaboration with Gramicci.

The main giveaway: her recalibrated volumes\u2014jackets were slouchier and sportier, shorts signaled city rather than beach, and the styling felt pleasingly off-the-cuff. Beyond this, batik and woodblock digital prints had a convincing handmade touch and brought liveliness to certain looks that otherwise leaned too beige. \u201cBohemian minimalist,\u201d was how the Budapest-based designer put it.

They chose punk culture as a loose starting point, which guided the dark color palette and moody in-studio images from photographer Giseok Cho, as well as the silver buckles and hoops that embellished the clothes. Still, it felt quite modern in its construction. See the black faux leather jacket with puffed sleeves and a thick bondage-style choker built into the neck, which stood stiff and straight like a mock turtleneck. It looked equally cool on a male and female model, the latter in a pleated miniskirt with a zipper running up the front. There were also several nods to bourgeois tailoring, though slightly twisted: a sleeveless wool blazer-vest, tightly cinched by a belt; a heather gray herringbone trench with half sleeves; and an intriguing hybrid minidress coat, cut from charcoal wool with three-quarter-length sleeves that were sliced across the top to flutter like a capelet.

If Redemption has a serious following, it\u2019s largely due to the success of the theory that, as Moratti puts it, \u201cone good solid red carpet is worth a thousand advertising pages.\u201d To wit, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and Gabrielle Union have all recently made high-profile outings. This Resort and the upcoming couture collection are particularly close to Moratti\u2019s heart because their inspirations are rooted in heavy metal, one of his favorite music genres. \u201cIt\u2019s a message I want to give, because it\u2019s what I\u2019m going through,\u201d he offered, segueing into a digression on World War I, Trump, North Korea, Justice Kavanaugh, and Metallica. \u201cI think and hope the night is darkest before the dawn,\u201d he said. On the other side of dark, Moratti is focusing on a wave of youth, music, the force of protest against a system, and positive change. The message of this collection is \u201cWe can do something to change the world.\u201d That might be through shifting entirely to vegan leather and diving deep into research on how to make it without plastic (from mushrooms and wine byproducts). It might be by keeping production 100 percent local, in Italy. And it is definitely by checking the boxes on what works well for the Coachella set (short shorts, low boots, flowy printed chiffon top; long dress with prairie belt), while working in more tailored pieces alongside glammed-up \u201980s-inspired eveningwear. Though Redemption is not yet profitable enough to fulfill Moratti\u2019s dream of allocating 50 percent of it profits for charity, he is clearly committed to seeing his vision through.

Its signature tweed jackets have gotten longer and more relaxed (read: no shoulder pads!), but the brand has been wise to invest in other categories like knits, outerwear, and leather. It\u2019s unlikely that tweed suiting will ever be the status symbol it was back in St. John\u2019s heyday. For Resort, the design team shifted gears even more and mined another part of its heritage: scarf prints, namely those with a nautical spirit. The color-blocked silk shirtdresses and blouses with graphic anchors, hooks, and ropes had a graphic, vintage-Herm\u00e8s quality that felt just bold enough to resonate with young shoppers. The other maritime motifs were much subtler: lots of blue, gold buttons or chain links here and there, and rope belts. For the St. John woman who steers clear of prints, the lightweight tweed jackets in navy or cream windowpane check will feel just a little seaworthy. That said, it\u2019s safe to assume many of the customers St. John is hoping to attract aren\u2019t even spending that much time on a sailboat or yacht. They likely find themselves on planes more frequently to travel for work. In that case, they should bookmark the label\u2019s expanded Sport collection, particularly the range of knitted trousers.

For Resort, the racks were lined with precisely the kind of gossamer, sequined confections that make Packham such a favorite on the awards and social circuits for high-profile clients ranging from Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Angelina Jolie, and Rachel Weisz right on up to the Duchess of Cambridge. On a recent trip to Madrid, a visit to the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum sparked a fascination for the Impressionist artist Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla, whose paintings of Mediterranean beach scenes sought to reproduce sunlight as it really is. Packham gamely transposed what she saw into fabric development, like pleated, gilded lam\u00e9, and finishings: key pieces included a sequined gold column dress with a matching cropped jacket inspired by the classic tweed variety; a blush-color \u201920s-inflected dress with a diaphanous cape; a d\u00e9grad\u00e9 of green sequins on a short, flared evening number; or a tiered, gold-hued bonbon wrapper of a party dress.

The fold-collar washed blue denim suit with a high full pant and the low-slung washed black denim work jacket with a tight jean were versions of the men\u2019s output rethought for women. There were, however, many looks that seemed specifically women-y and possibly not rooted in the work of Le Corbusier and his school. The hot red, dye-brushed, tie-front leather flares as pediment to a mixed floral shirt with a Keith Richards neckline; the tie-front black mini with drawstring, over-the-knee boots, and a gathered striped shirt; and the python-print cycling pants over another double ditsy were examples of these. Taverniti conceded these looks were not mere fashion equivalents of machines for living in: \u201cIt\u2019s important to give a sense of romance and poetry.

Her see-through white crochet wedding dress is way up on fashion Olympus. For Resort, the design team at Blumarine tapped into the mood of innocent yet provocative sensuality her style conveyed. The innocence was just barely apparent, but that\u2019s why we love Jane Birkin so much. Designer Anna Molinari has built the Lolita-esque style of Blumarine around the color of flamingos, candies, Marie Antoinette\u2019s wigs, and, of course, roses. The flowers were strewn abundantly as prints on a floor-sweeping candy-pink tiered chiffon dress, and bloomed on a blush-pink pencil skirt in cotton jacquard that was paired with a dusty-pink cotton ruffled crochet sweater worn off the shoulders ingenue-style. The pink symphony continued on macaron-hued crochet dresses \u00e0 la Birkin; on long nude-pink tulle numbers delicately embroidered with roses; and on golden-pink sequined jumpsuits with a \u201970s flair. To invigorate the languid mood, Molinari reverted to her beloved leopard print, throwing into the saccharine mix a wow-factor wrapcoat in lam\u00e9-wool boucl\u00e9 with a fringed hem, and a pair of sexy shorts paired with a lipstick-print cropped top. Touches of bright-lime green on an organza blouse with a pussy bow, of shiny gold on a leather Perfecto, and of turquoise on a floor-sweeping, halter-necked silk charmeuse evening dress gave the collection a charming, feminine vibrancy, which is just what you expect from Blumarine."}, {"Designer": "Alexis Mabille", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Alexis Mabille continues to frame his Resort offering as an eveningwear capsule, making the most of his penchant for panache.

He landed on such an array of pink and peach tones after noticing the nuance of Picasso\u2019s Rose Period paintings. But of course, pink is as much an Alexis Mabille signature as the bow (spot them seamlessly placed into the cap sleeves of a \u201930s nightdress or more dramatically projecting from the neck of a dressy blouse). Alongside thoughtful arrangements of broderie anglaise (the dimensional waves of it on a classic shirt being quite lovely) there were frothy sprays of birdcage netting and tulle blanketed in cherry blossom embroidery. There were also some interesting optional flourishes: a fringed belt or scarf that can be unbuttoned and detached for a more streamlined look. Other than the varsity jacket striped with Lurex that belonged in another collection, this lineup was reliably feminine, its timeless styles spanning soft to strong. Mabille is never not thinking like a couturier whose chief objective is to make clothes that fit flawlessly, which explains why he gets excited about using a figure-flattering silk faille or perfecting a dress whose cape covers the upper arms but can also be swept back in cinematic style. \u201cWe can cheat here and there,\u201d he said with an encouraging smile."}, {"Designer": "Etro", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Veronica Etro\u2019s vision for Resort felt more in keeping with her brother Kean\u2019s menswear than usual.

Travel is a recurring subtext for Etro, a metaphor for an open-minded attitude, exploring and welcoming cross-cultural influences, approached with a cultivated and respectful eye. For Resort, motifs inspired by the Moroccan desert and Berber jewelry were rendered into abstract prints in soothing, dusty pastel tones of sand, shell pink, mauve, and light chartreuse, giving floor-sweeping ruched dresses in cotton gauze, organza, or chiffon a feel of lightness. Suede fringed belted jackets reinforced the \u201970s haute hippie vibe, together with elaborate wool jacquard patterns inspired by Moroccan rugs that were translated into belted cardigans worn over striped masculine shirts or romantic blouses. Continuing with the theme, djellaba shirt jackets in thick textured wool were decorated with patches of floral motifs, and embroidered caftans were worn Talitha Getty\u2013style with billowing dresses in a new, lighter take on the label\u2019s signature paisley patterns. The contrast between free-spirited nomadism and a more bourgeois attitude played out in \u201970s-inspired suits in checkered wool featuring slightly oversized blazers and culottes. Worn with slim-fit cashmere-printed blazers, flared wide-leg denim pants were given a twist of chic, while a mannish pantsuit had a rather conservative flavor, just enlivened by a multicolored checkered wool.

He also tried it out in matte and shiny stripes and clean windowpane checks with ecru. Elsewhere, the designer took a few measured steps outside of his own comfort zone. A reliable source for sharply tailored, high-waisted trousers, Grant decided to explore a new shape as his jean of the season. The result is a more voluminous silhouette than he typically shows, a sort of cropped carrot-meets-cargo. He continued his exploration of volume primarily in dropped shoulders and batwing sleeves. A cocoon-shouldered shrug looked cool; a roomy sand-colored trench paired nicely with a turmeric base, and a sky-blue parachute dress with turmeric dots was one of the easiest throw-it-on pieces Grant has ever done. Of course, his base will find here the looks they rely on him for: a chic-as-it-gets white pantsuit, a peacoat, a deep-V jumpsuit, a few asymmetrical cocktail numbers.

A djellaba-like shape was the template for a series of hooded striped tunics, paired with sporty sleeveless bombers in black satin. Djellabas were also proposed in the men\u2019s line, worn under classically tailored dark suits. The same elongated, roomy construction was offered in a knitted vertical-wide-striped version in tones of coral, teal, and brown. The play on generous volumes was highlighted in a black jumpsuit with billowing pants, or else in an oversize hooded parka in black laser-cut suede. In the leather grouping, one of the strongest looks was a pliss\u00e9 midi skirt in Santa Fe yellow, worn with a black cotton tee emblazoned with a tone-on-tone laser-etched house logo. For men, black leather took on an assertive edge, cut sharp and boxy on polo shirts and minimalist biker jackets. On a different note, one infused with a touch of romance, a dark blazer cinched at the waist and worn with a floor-sweeping pleated skirt seemed to pay homage to O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s idiosyncratic style; it was one of the collection\u2019s standouts, together with an abstract take on archival foulard motifs printed on double-layered dresses that gently clung to the body, conveying a feminine, summery feel of lightness and transparency. Andrew is finding his voice at Ferragamo, trying to shape a credible aesthetic with a luxurious timeless flavor rooted in modernity. Focusing smartly on high-end daywear, giving leather dressing a pride of place, treating archival prints with a light twist, focusing on color as a cohesive, energizing ingredient\u2014it all seems to point in the right direction.

Various knits fuse on a single cardigan, for example, or classic front-pleat trousers might get the punk treatment. \u201cWe\u2019re living in chaotic times,\u201d Merikoski pointed out during a showroom visit, explaining that his idea was to take the bourgeoisie, season it with a little anarchy, and use humble arte povera\u2013type materials and treatments to create \u201ca random glam.\u201d Extrapolating the signature Aalto wave into a stratified lava print was one of the most successful of these statements; it appeared in striking orange, blue, and yellow on one coat, and to more subtle effect in shades of soft yellow on other ensembles. Punk-inflected straps became button-as-you-will lavaliers on shirts. Merikoski even threw a tiger wave print into the mix; it and the logo-like graphic disc symbol appeared somewhat referential but will likely please his base nonetheless. Another key development was the \u201ctie-dye camouflage\u201d treatment that washed over a billowing trench or a front-tie jacket. In a strong shoulder season, Merikoski placed the accent on both gentle slopes, as on an otherwise fitted white denim jacket, and peaks, jutting them out in V-shaped plackets on a black single-breasted number with a technical sheen.

Right now, in the age of influencers, Hollywood glamour means something you can pinpoint to Kardashian mania, beauty vloggers, and dressed-up Instagrammers. Rudes\u2019s interpretation seemed to mostly fit this mold, and he expressed it through pieces like a micromini tank dress with leopard sequins, and bias-cut cowl-neck camis and slip dresses. He shot the new collection inside a nightclub called the Red Dragon in L.A., just the sort of place you might find Kendall Jenner or Gigi Hadid, wearing something like a slinky slip or a body-hugging dress.

Rudes was smart to incorporate pieces targeted toward a nonmillennial\u2019s definition of Hollywood glamour\u2014like the cool denim blazer with fraying at the edges, and the paisley and leopard-print trench. There were plenty of beautiful and wearable basics too, including a brown silk blouse and several pairs of skinny jeans.

Having shed the last vestiges of his former places of employ, Cadwallader brought a new clarity to this lineup. It looked definitively Mugler, but without succumbing to retro derivativeness. One example: the hourglass dresses with soft corsetry structure at the midsection. \u201cThey\u2019re not uncomfortable to wear this way,\u201d he explained. Also on point: jackets and coats with padded accents at the hips but otherwise quite exacting tailoring. He\u2019s realized that exaggerated shoulders together with accentuated hips can be overpowering for some women. Which is why he\u2019s also made a new, more fitted version of his clever spiral-cut jeans. Cadwallader cast a diverse array of characters, including a bodybuilder, vogueing dancers from the Paris House of Mugler, and the fortysomething model Debra Shaw.

You can plunge into its source material by looking up Hyung S. Kim\u2019s photo series of South Korean female free divers known as haenyeo. For all the stunning expression they register, it\u2019s impossible to ignore how their functional scuba outfits inadvertently pass for fantastic fashion statements. \u201cThey put themselves together in a unique way that I thought was super-inspiring,\u201d said Virgil Abloh, who pointed to Off-White looks that were put together as near-identical interpretations\u2014from belt bags mimicking their weighted belts to a misshapen floral tank that now appeared as a trompe l\u2019oeil knit. As fine as it was to see further adaptations of this theme\u2014an aquatic-hued sequin slip dress, watery effect denim, fishnet layers, neoprene sneakers, and Teva-type sandals\u2014it was more interesting to consider how he had rooted out a remote subculture composed of weathered yet active women, and repackaged their recreational pursuit as slick, sexy suiting and graphic sportswear. The combined outcome might seem like perfect bait for his youthful following. But Abloh, who marveled over these \u201cfisherwomen,\u201d said his newish boutique in Soho has proven that a more mature clientele is buying in, as well. Might he have dared to feature their likeness here? Back when Abloh was fixated on inserting conceptual and high-brow art references into his Off-White collections, it felt as though he was flaunting a certain cultural wherewithal; because back then, perhaps, the sink-or-swim stakes were higher. Now, as he continues to ride such a phenomenal wave of success, he can turn out a pre-collection that feels confident, cool, and commercially complete.

To celebrate the anniversary, the designer found himself looking back in time, toward the women and references that have inspired him most. On a visit to his home in Georgia, a country on the border of Europe and Asia, where he was born, Koma stumbled upon a stash of old VHS tapes he would frequently watch growing up. Cult classics like 9 1/2 Weeks and Basic Instinct informed his new Resort lineup. With that in mind, the homage to that infamous Sharon Stone scene was unmistakable. In the look book the gorgeous model Yasmin Wijnaldum recreates the moment; she\u2019s pictured cross-legged in a little crystal-strapped white satin dress cut dangerously high up the thigh. Elsewhere, there were nods to \u201960s fashion pioneer Rudi Gernreich, whose work helped guide the swimsuits and bodysuits that were layered under leather minidresses or paired with pants.

His version of a gown was unabashedly sexy\u2014a glittering sheer column dress embellished with hundreds of mirrored shards. On the flip side of that was the brand\u2019s first foray into denim. Whether Korma fans will get on board with the designer\u2019s skintight skinny jeans, cut with jersey on one side, remains to be seen.

There were plenty of her signature print dresses, but the standout looks were the embroidered pieces, like a wide-sleeved short black frock with charming pink embroidery at the neck. A hot-item alert were the skinny jeans with a funky tropics-on-acid print. The important tried-and-true garments from the label are the rash guards and swimsuits, which stem from Rowley\u2019s love for surfing but are popular well beyond ocean lovers. The pieces, which often give coverage on the arms, cater to a whole population of modest dressers. Rowley recently found this out when she was asked to create a customized burkini\u2060\u2014now buyable\u2060\u2014for Muslim model Halima Aden in the 2019 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue. This season, modest dressers, avid surfers, and people who just want to cover up on the beach will be impressed with Rowley\u2019s selection: She created a superchic, very groovy \u201cwave camouflage\u201d print bodysuit that allows the bather to blend into the ocean, achieving a sartorial swim fantasy for all."}, {"Designer": "Petar Petrov", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "\u201cThe next logical step would be to have some sort of walking presentation, something to finally establish that Petar Petrov is an actual person rather than a made-up brand name.\u201d So wrote Sarah Mower almost exactly a year ago at the first Vogue Runway\u2013reviewed Petrov collection, and that point still stands.

They transport the reality of the garments, yet little of their potential to delight. At this one, we dutifully ranged through the rail, again, as Petrov discussed creating a more fluid silhouette in his sophisticated tailoring. That fluidity was displayed in a photo on the lookbook sheet on the table in front of us, in which the back of a bronze-buttoned, perkily shouldered, putty-colored jacket flew back at the vent. On the rail, though, gravity pulled them down to flat stillness. Another picture featured this season\u2019s model Sara Blomqvist in a repeated dress shape that, in a patched hammered-silk devor\u00e9, seemed to glint like a Klimt in print, but from which context sucked all impact when we tracked it down on a busy showroom model giving some buyers an up-and-down. Looking at a pair of rich tea leather pants, each leg falling slouchily from the hanger like some unctuous caramel stalactite, you could, with a bit of mental squinting, project a vision of a Petrov woman who would take the biscuit wearing them. Yet why the need to squint? Petrov\u2019s reputation and sales have surely grown even more in the last year, so it would be great to see him take that next logical step and have a show, or a presentation, or a something in which models rather than hangers wear the clothes in an environment (6, Rue Fabert looks good) that matches the sophistication of the garments he is producing."}, {"Designer": "Bibhu Mohapatra", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "In the process of renovating a historic 19th-century house in upstate New York, Bibhu Mohapatra discovered period newspapers that had been used for insulation.

A passementerie-trimmed white cotton blouse and wide-leg pants is about as casual at Mohapatra gets.

The most noteworthy development for Resort was the addition of swimwear. Bikinis, plunge-front maillots, and rash guards that could do double-duty with cutoffs or a peasant skirt were cut in lively patterns with built-in SPF. Elsewhere, a strapless white cotton dress with delicate smocking at the torso was another novelty.

A Versace-redolent long dress in black cr\u00eape studded with gold insignia and with up-to-there side slits, as worn on Di Patrizi, looked as if it could stop Milanese traffic dead.

Although it might seem a rather first-degree strategy, it was actually in keeping with Ravizza\u2019s straightforward, no-nonsense approach: The collection was simple and wearable, the fur almost absent from the equation. To align with the current trend for romantic frocks, the designer added a few floral-printed cotton dresses, which she showed under oversize denim jackets trimmed with ruched tulle, or a glossy red patent leather trench coat. The rest of the collection tread familiar Ravizza territory, with sporty leather anoraks in neutral colors, biker jackets, and long suede shirtdresses open at the front.

A play between masculine and feminine elements is part of the Dell\u2019Acqua vocabulary; for the French house of Rochas, it always gets an elevated flair and a touch of polish. Slightly oversized trench coats in silk duchesse were worn over floor-sweeping tiered dresses in silk charmeuse; crinkled silk was molded into featherlight balloon dresses; a blazer in precious Tasmanian wool was paired with a matching skirt/pants hybrid and offset by a wispy organza blouse.

For evening, there was a beautiful floor-length black gown with a corseted bodice and tulle ruffles along its square neckline, further embellished by scrunched up straps that were, Kristopher explained, a grosgrain ribbon tunneled through organza. For day, she might turn to a babydoll top, cut from an ornate floral jacquard and puffed out around the waist by a stiff horsehair peplum. (Horsehair peplum belts also featured as accessories, layered over skirts). Simpler additions included a new denim style that fit looser and straighter through the leg, as well as more fundamental items like a very roomy cream knit, a three-piece silk pajama set (the third piece being a balconette bra, naturally), a felted wool dressing coat, and a slew of white slips and other pieces meant for a bride.

Flowers were actually very much part of her Resort collection, which she named Forces For Nature. Hand-drawn bouquets were printed on light cloqu\u00e9 summer dresses in delicate tones of peony, wisteria, and primrose, as if they had just been picked up in a field or in a bluebell wood in spring, during one of the weekends she loves to spend in the countryside with her family. \u201cIt\u2019s always the best time,\u201d she said. It also goes without saying that McCartney isn\u2019t afraid of challenges: \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in change,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen something is getting too comfortable, I tend to feel uncomfortable.\u201d Her company is undergoing a sort of mutation, becoming independent after having being part of the Kering Group for so many years.

For Resort, her approach has become more overt: \u201cNormally you don\u2019t see what we do in terms of manufacturing conscientiousness,\u201d she explained. \u201cAll the efforts we make in doing what we do are in the product, not on the product. This season I wanted to make it more visible.\u201d Enter Everything Is Illuminated\u2019s best-selling author Jonathan Safran Foer, who, feeling a kindred spirit in McCartney, sent her his book Eating Animals a few years ago. \u201cI was blown away,\u201d she said. A friendship ensued and now a collaboration, which has been years in the making. Safran Foer has a new book called We Are The Weather which will be out in September: \u201cSo I said to Jonathan, \u2018Why don\u2019t I put into fashion what it is you\u2019re putting into words?\u201d Together they came up with the round pattern of a sun, which became Resort\u2019s distinctive print: \u201cIt\u2019s the circular weather, it\u2019s the clouds, it\u2019s the rain; the sun is breathing, blowing wind,\u201d said McCartney. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a little bit trippy, a little bit \u201990s, a sort of dance-trance vibe.\u201d The \u201cWe Are The Weather\u201d motif, together with Franzen\u2019s handwritten statements, like \u201cWe Are Entirely Free To Live Differently\u201d or \u201cBe Leaving, Believing, Be Living,\u201d were printed, knitted, or embroidered throughout the collection, which is 60 percent made of sustainable fabrics like organic cotton, sustainable viscose, regenerated nylon, recycled polyester, Alter-nappa, and the newly introduced traceable alpaca. What\u2019s great about McCartney\u2019s clothes is that they are as much fashion-forward in concept as they\u2019re covetable and cool in style. Resort offered plenty of smart options for our everyday busy lives, great utilitarian pieces cut with clarity and minimalism: roomy jumpsuits; imaginative textural knitwear; upcycled denim jackets and pants. Day dresses had effortless ease and inventive cuts, as did a circular cloqu\u00e9 number in a spectacular shade of red. As always chez Stella, Savile Row-style tailoring was a strong proposition, a standout being a sharp-tailored black tuxedo, with a touch of whimsy in the loose flowing ribbons subtly embroidered with the \u201cWe Are The Weather\u201d beaded handwriting. Menswear complemented the women\u2019s line both in concept and design, with an emphasis on modern sporty flair and a casual, playful take on tailoring. \u201cI always try to keep it light and have an element of humor,\u201d said McCartney. In addition to the \u201cWe Are The Weather\u201d motifs, hand-painted horses (\u201cnothing is digitalized, all drawings are made by hand\u201d) were printed on a matching silk shirt, tie and shorts; a leopard pattern created by scaled-up photocopies of Fur-Free-Fur was printed on generously-cut lightweight dusters. On a roomy jumpsuit, an all-over Earth satellite print looked like an abstract camo motif; an Eco-Weirdo graphic patched on a T-shirt felt like an irreverent take on logomania. \u201cIt\u2019s this idea that we are a bit of Eco-Weirdos and we\u2019re kind of proud about it,\u201d said the designer. In keeping with the festive, uplifting mood embedded in the house of McCartney, both collections were presented tonight during Milan Men\u2019s opening day with a party in the enchanting garden of an old Milanese palazzo. But the event had a provocative edge: Models mingled with a collective of young activists performing a peaceful protest and chanting slogans on climate change awareness. Ribbons made of upcycled archival materials were flowing in the wind and could be personalized with messages for loved ones; they\u2019ll be donated to a local design school to make sure that there\u2019ll be zero waste. McCartney was radiant: \u201cIf you want to buy something these days, buy something that isn\u2019t killing your planet!\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have a fashion platform, if you have a voice, take responsibility and do something more than just a pretty color or a pretty hemline right now.

Bendet was a mix of relaxed and ready for a challenge, like at any moment she could go sit outside and sip wine at Pastis around the corner or head to a meeting in the boardroom across from the studio space. This subtle place between the typical jazzed-up Alice + Olivia girl and her slightly more mature counterpart is exactly where the designer wanted her new Resort lineup to fall. So much so that, for the first time, Bendet introduced her own version of a basics line, including suiting separates and day-to-night dresses in monochrome palettes. Those jackets, trousers, and tops are a smart addition to the A + O family. It was nice to see a larger range of clean, fresh silhouettes in Bendet\u2019s mix, not only because it made the entire collection feel more diverse than usual but also because they\u2019re well-made garments that can stand on their own without a hint of neon or a statement phrase. Speaking of flash, though, there was still plenty of it here. Bendet\u2019s mixed scarf prints gave the lineup a cool pop, as did the beautifully beaded, boho-inspired skirt styled with a simple black T-shirt. That\u2019s the thing: Bendet does make a lot of clothes that can be paired with more pedestrian pieces like a tee or jeans. If those have been difficult to parse out in the past, they were certainly more visible in this Resort collection. Bendet is still Bendet at the end of the day, basics be damned, but she certainly struck an impressive balance this season between the extra and the everyday."}, {"Designer": "Solace London", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Laura Taylor and Ryan Holliday-Stevens stuck to their commercial catnip M.O. for Resort\u2014powerfully dramatic silhouettes, minimally expressed and with an emphasis on technically enhanced comfort\u2014but they moved it on, too.

Visual shrapnel thrown by exploding sleeves, mushroom-cloud skirts, and shockwave-ruffle bodice details caught your eye at every turn, yet equally evident was the laser cut and four-way stretch wearer-friendliness of these pieces.

But it\u2019s summer, and a trip to the seaside is always in the cards even in the most improbable fairy tales, so she added plenty of corals and marini\u00e8re knots and bows. Open-wide eyes, smiling lips, and delicate hands were also scattered hide-and-seek style among flowers and foliage. Voil\u00e0! The imaginative patterns for the Resort collection were set. A \u201970s flair was infused in long, fluid printed dresses \u00e0 la Ossie Clark. V-necked, high-waisted, and billowy-sleeved, they contrasted with more voluminous tiered numbers, crisp and poufy as delicious meringues. There were also cotton tea dresses in broderie anglaise fit for a garden party with Alice in Wonderland. Huge trompe l\u2019oeil bows were knitted onto marini\u00e8re sweaters paired with pliss\u00e9 skirts or transformed into capelet sleeves capping short trapeze poplin dresses.

The floral-collage print, apparently nodding to ancient Carthage, made the strongest impact when given maximum surface area, the jet-set caftan strongest of all. And even though it will be months before the collection arrives in stores, many of the showpieces in pigments extracted from Ottoman tiles might already be heading to destinations near and far. Nonetheless, this remained a rather rarefied crossroads, where taffeta balloon sleeves added even more drama to embroidered gowns and, whether intentional or not, incrustations of lace intersected at crossroads across the body. In this context, Bermuda-style shorts were considered a novelty, as was the tuxedo look from a grouping in metallic green and black jacquard; ideally, the collection would make further inroads here. Comparatively wearable day-to-night dresses in fluid crepe were not specific to the theme; in this way, they almost qualified as basic.

The British designer took a dual-pronged trip back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, and that pivotal period when the last days of New York disco merged with the angsty energy of punk. \u201cI think there\u2019s a reflection between then and now,\u201d said Henry Holland. \u201cIt\u2019s a time when everyone was so pissed off with the world that all they wanted to do was get wasted.\u201d Holland\u2019s muse for this hedonistic time was the German pop singer, artist, and all-round exhibitionist Nina Hagen. The siren-like visage of the self-described \u201cgodmother of punk\u201d\u2014who was immortalized in Peter Sempel\u2019s 1999 documentary film Nina Hagen = Punk + Glory\u2014was inscribed onto monochrome sweaters and tees paired with 12-eye Dr. Martens with bright hiking-boot laces. \u201cHer look is very relevant today,\u201d said Holland of the chameleonic, rainbow-haired performer. \u201cShe was a colorful punk and that\u2019s exactly how a House of Holland girl would wear it. She\u2019s very Bleach Dalston,\u201d he added, referring to the East London beauty parlor that helped spearhead today\u2019s tastes for multihued manes. Holland borrowed from Hagen\u2019s preference for Lurex leotards and leggings with sporty, stretchy, and stripy fabrications. Cheetah prints in a zingy palette had a deliberately haphazard feel that echoed the xeroxed pages of a punk fanzine in a nod to the artist of the age, Stephen Sprouse. These edgier looks were peppered with the high-shine of Studio 54 in a prelude to a \u201cdeep disco dive\u201d next season. A highlight among all the panel-striped satin and lace-and-Lurex was a tobacco-toned, puff-shouldered minidress, an iteration of which has already been custom-made for pop star Lizzo. Pink, white, and baby blue satin three-piece suits that take their tone from the transgender pride flag formed part of a newly launched capsule. And Holland\u2019s sell-out collaboration with performance swimwear company Speedo also got a punchy reprise. Who could resist a monogram-print one-piece worn with a silver puffer coat and chunky Grenson trainers? Holland\u2019s gutsy remix of Manhattan\u2019s past lives will surely resonate with his contemporary crowd."}, {"Designer": "No. 21", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The idea of freedom has been on the minds of many designers this season. It isn\u2019t surprising, living as we are in a moment when freedom is clearly under threat. Without making any political statement, Alessandro Dell\u2019Acqua addressed the issue his way. Being one of fashion\u2019s adroit cin\u00e9philes, he referred to the French Nouvelle Vague, which in the early \u201860s subverted the rules of filmmaking in favor of a more freestyle, realistic, low-fi approach. It was a moment of thriving artistic expression, one which the designer tried to convey in the collection\u2019s feel of dynamic insouciance. \u201cI\u2019d like to bring back a sense of inventive elegance,\u201d he explained. \u201dA sort of new spirit of creative curiosity.\u201d To drive home the point, he focused both his men\u2019s and women\u2019s collections on relaxed tailoring infused with playful lightness. He kept the sportswear references to a minimum, mirroring one of today\u2019s shifting paradigms. As at many other labels, a sporty feel was suggested via the comfort inherent to the garments\u2019 construction (say, allowing freedom of movement through smart non-constricting cutting techniques and the use of supple fabrics) more so than by an overt, literal interpretation. For women\u2019s, it translated in easy yet precise silhouettes, livened up by the unconventional pairing of fabrics, an inventive knack for embellishments, and the laid-back glamour the designer favors. Shapes were gently generous, kept rather simple, yet imbued with a luxe vibe with couture-like fabrics, such as silk faille, techno taffeta, broderie anglaise, and jacquard brocades. Feminine details, like humongous winglike bows at the back of short, skinny slip dresses, added to the imaginative feel. Even glammed-up eveningwear was given the comfort treatment. A case in point was a long one-shoulder goddess dress dripping in golden sequins, ready for the red carpet, yet comfortable thanks to an adjustable elasticized waist. Menswear was envisioned along the same lines; soft tailoring featured prominently, the \u201860s vibe well in evidence in skinny suits. No tracksuits or sweatpants or hoodies were in sight. On the contrary, shiny fabrics, such as radzimir, often embroidered in black-on-black with abstract graphics, gave the collection a modern polish."}, {"Designer": "Nicole Miller", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The term garden party comes with a specific set of associations. For her Resort 2020 collection, Nicole Miller wanted to update the idea. Prim fashion has its place, but Miller is more interested in the ever-evolving wardrobes of New York\u2019s downtown girls. This season that meant an exploration of florals, leopard prints, and, oddly enough, take-out bags; Miller paid homage to the ubiquitous \u201cHave a Nice Day\u201d plastic totes familiar to anyone who has ever visited a bodega by splashing their messaging onto loose tanks and the backs of denim jackets. The plastic reference came with an environmental message. Miller\u2019s interest in sustainability was the impetus behind recent pieces like Fall\u2019s upcycled cashmere sweaters; here she couldn\u2019t resist giving the recycling logo its own shout-out via a gauzy singlet. Symbols aside, the collection\u2019s focus was florals. Asymmetrical skirts, ruched dresses, and cropped jumpsuits featured all manner of flowers from oversized roses to a vintage print straight out of the archives. The latter came courtesy of a longtime client who\u2019d preserved pieces from Miller\u2019s first collections for decades and reached out to the designer. \u201cShe had saved all these dresses from the 1980s, and back then what I was designing was so big with shoulder pads and oversized proportions,\u201d Miller said at her garment district headquarters. \u201cShe gave us 12 or so pieces, and it just felt right to include one of the prints in this collection\u2014this time on a streamlined look.\u201d Blooms are always cheerful, but Miller mixed things up to add visual interest. Some pairings were more successful than others\u2014a reversible leopard-and-rose quilted overcoat provided an appealing transition piece\u2014but the styles were uniformly upbeat. Brief forays into glittering leopard spots and denim on denim provided moments of contrast and a glimpse at how real women will be wearing things.

For Josie Natori, who centered her Resort offerings on Marrakech, the challenge was finding a fresh ways to interpret the well-loved theme. Since repositioning her eponymous line as ultra-luxury, Natori has focused on bringing the best in fabrications to her audience, and the sumptuous textiles allowed for several riffs on geometric patterns that echoed the look of decorative tile work. Black-and-white silk tops with belted sashes and day dresses featured the evocative print, as did an embroidered day dress and lightweight coat. Lace meant to echo arabesque shapes made its way onto puffed sleeves and hemlines\u2014a simple touch that made the all-black pieces feel summery. Lingerie is essential to Natori\u2019s brand DNA, and the addition of two lace mini-dresses brought a bit of sultriness to the collection. Still, the overarching mood was minimal and understated.

Here were yesteryear-feeling pieces, looks that appeared as if they were plucked from a vintage store in Paris, like a slinky, body-hugging oxidized crimson dress embroidered in abstract florals (Khan wanted to shift from dainty flowers this season) with a dropping back. Separates, something Khan is developing more, had a shining moment, like his version of the shawl. The collection could have veered into dowdy territory but the delicately embroidered piece with swinging fringe and its cropped cut lent a cool figure when worn with a silk tank and drawstring pants. Fun fact: Khan started his career at the house of Halston, and here he created several dresses as an ode. They still stand the test of time and looked quite chic, including a glitzy body-hugging purple number with a criss-cross neck. Khan always has his international customer base in mind, and a big moment here was the update on the kaftan.

Her updated approach to the bygone era was carefully stitched into each look: There was a drop-shoulder on a blouse, as opposed to a traditional dolman sleeve; a floral peasant dress was modified into a romper silhouette; and a shift dress was layered over matching pants and sleek pumps, not go-go boots. The black power suit with rhinestone piping was this collection\u2019s standout look, destined for a night in boogie wonderland (or just a holiday party, given Resort\u2019s delivery dates of November and December).

And no one was talking about modest clothing. The widening of fashion\u2019s collective consciousness has been slow, but progress is being made. The runways may not yet reflect the world as it is, with its diversity of color, age, and size, but they\u2019re more representative than at any time in the past. Ton\u2019s street style photos and those of others like him have played their part in fashion\u2019s awakening, alongside the rise of Instagram, the presence of female designers in top jobs, and the consciousness raising of #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up. He has an eye for \u201creal women\u201d with real style, not influencers in head-to-toe runway looks, and his taste runs to the minimal, though it\u2019s not strict. Phoebe Philo\u2019s C\u00e9line is a touchstone. Ton has brought that sensibility with him to Deveaux, the New York menswear label where he took the creative director role a year and a half ago and quickly launched women\u2019s; it\u2019s now bigger than the men\u2019s offering. \u201cThe clothing is grounded in reality,\u201d he said of the brand\u2019s first Resort collection.

It was a right, old nipple-flasher. As we searched in vain for the garment (it was en route from the atelier) and contemplated its image this morning, Daniel Lee ventured: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a bit of humor.\u201d Then he added this aside: \u201cI think there\u2019s a bit of misconception around me as well, that I am super serious because I\u2019m not on Instagram. I just don\u2019t like it [Instagram], but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m serious!\u201d As we moved on to a thin rib-knit sweater in a dense and slightly spongy black cotton that featured a knotted extrusion running from outside the right shoulder into an opening by the left, Lee was asked if there was any other reason for the seriousness misconception. \u201cI guess it\u2019s because of the kind of clothes that I make\u2026.and Bottega is a very grown-up house, for sure. And I do think in the market right now there is a space for that which is very relevant. But it is something we can have some fun with, too\u2014just thought-through fun.\u201d Bradford-raised Englishman Lee was made creative director at this most sophisticated but undeniably austere of Italian houses only 11 months ago. Early reactions have been positive where it counts most: ready-to-wear sales have since tripled across all markets and now make up 15% of total revenue. Yet that doesn\u2019t mean that Lee\u2014who seemed relaxed and affable despite the black-suited pin-drop atmosphere of BV\u2019s corporate culture\u2014is afraid to change lanes when the instinct grabs him. He said: \u201cThis season\u2026we stepped back and analyzed what had worked so far, what was strong and also where I felt we needed to improve.\u201d Which leads back to that notion of seriousness. Of his last collection, Lee said: \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was so successful when things became too cool and hardened. I don\u2019t think that really reflected me. Bottega Veneta, and Italian culture in general, is something that feels very warm, friendly, and inviting to me.\u201d That this review hands a lot of quote space to Lee reflects that he has seemed an enigmatic presence since arriving here. There is that lack of a social-media second life, plus his decision not to speak after his debut runway collection, and the fact that his last gig was at Celine\u2014a pre-BV CV entry that brings its own particularly loaded flavor of scrutiny. Yet during the time not squandered posting Facetuned vacay selfies, Lee has evidently drilled deep to mine some brand-consistent building blocks with which to reconstruct Bottega Veneta his way. The moulded raised-square gridding on the bibs of menswear and womenswear shirting and women\u2019s skirts was, like the heat-pressed ribbing at the waistline of a deadly chic leather trench for women and on the leg of a men\u2019s short track pant, inspired by Milan\u2019s culture of industrial design. Along with the semi-sheer fitted knit dresses, plus sweaters for men and women in ribbed cottons and wools, plus leather dresses (a version in orange was especially entangling on the eye), this emphasis on connection and pattern was, of course, a reflection of the house\u2019s Intrecciato DNA: tying together and the patterns that result. Bottega Veneta\u2019s traditional medium, leather, was well represented in the rattan-esque gridding found on a beautiful women\u2019s coat (its pattern reflected in a gridded gold-sequined dress), as well as in trenches and jeans for both genders that featured diagonally bottomed leather paneling atop their respective gabardine and denim. In menswear there was a surprising emphasis on tailoring. Even without inserted circular panels at each hip pocket, a BV evening suit was a surprising thing, but the softly boxy luxuriousness of its cut and mostly cashmere flannel fabrication (strong in powder blue), fit well both against the more overtly evening womenswear looks and the more casual men\u2019s. These included double-faced knit tracksuits with inverted seaming (something echoed in a fine white boiled wool skirt and cardigan for women) and some long, crispy cotton trenches, which were a feature for men\u2019s and women\u2019s. Bags were predictably want-able, but not predictable. A wrist-slung, tightly knotted bag in blue, tan, or orange strips of soft matte leather and a loosely knotted perforated tote were two especially comely Intrecciato models. A sandal and raised mule in fake snake featured three and a half encirclements of leather strip that ran from the Achilles upwards: these worked to cinch Lee\u2019s expertly cut wide-leg pants and were complemented by similarly functioning bracelets. To fulfill his brief for Bottega Veneta, Lee must reconcile many apparently competing factors. He has to make its output feel like it\u2019s fit for the future yet rooted in the signatures of the house\u2019s heritage. He wants to speed up its rhythm and seasonality while ensuring that the deep deliberation in the craft of its designs remains on full display. This collection suggests he has the breadth of vision to gather in all these strands and compellingly tie them together."}, {"Designer": "St. Roche", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "From season to season, there\u2019s a delicate softness to Sue Stemp\u2019s embroidered and floral-printed ready-to-wear.

She also mentioned Gianni Versace\u2019s neon florals and leopard spots, saying that her hope with this collection is to give her customers bright, bold pieces that they can wear together or with the more pedestrian garments already in their wardrobes. With a history in styling, Bereson is a keen observer of how people dress at any given time. She confirmed she has her finger on the pulse with relevant, desirable pieces like a zebra-print ruffled wrap dress with voluminous sleeves. The pop of orange and lime green on a pair of floral jacquard trousers and a matching jacket was a nostalgic take on tailoring, while her mixed-print shirtdress looked like a new age version of that preppy Palm Beach staple. Bereson\u2019s latest wares look of-the-moment, with just the right amount of retro flair."}, {"Designer": "6397", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "There\u2019s an interesting push-and-pull happening inside of the 6397 studio. Stella Ishii and her team have built 6397 to be a brand of offbeat staples, like a patchwork jacket compiled from leftover scraps of denim production, or their mondo-size cuff jean. But then there\u2019s the fact that Ishii and company have, somewhat inadvertently, become a hot commodity in the country club world. It\u2019s not that surprising\u2014in a market that is super saturated with statement pieces, 6397\u2019s classic jeans, pull-on tropical wool pants, and unfussy cashmere sweaters have mass appeal. Can 6397 go mass without losing the rebellious spirit that makes it so special? Ishii and her team have found a balance for Resort by subverting the very upper-crust staples they\u2019re making. Take a piqu\u00e9 T-shirt dress: in Nantucket blue and red stripes, it hints at propriety, but it\u2019s blown up to be extra loose, almost grungy even. A three-quarter button-down is extra boxy while a heathered suit in dusty pink has a draped back that flies outwards with the introduction of a breeze. Another plaid suit might seem professional, but it\u2019s cut in fleece, like a favorite sweatshirt. The brand has also expanded its color range to include a murky chartreuse and rose pink, used sparingly but effectively on a silk skirt and a pair of nylon pants. There\u2019s even a safety orange anorak that packs up into its pouch. The season\u2019s graphics include a Phish-worthy \u201cFar Rock\u201d scrawl and a simple-text print that reads \u201cYou Are Here.\u201d The latter is a nod to John Lennon, who sang \u201cLove has opened up my eyes/ Love has blown right through/ Wherever you are, you are here,\u201d to Yoko Ono in a 1973 track of the same name. In the showroom, the Beatles were playing throughout this appointment.

The designer played on familiar glam turf for Resort. Tailored pantsuits or elongated dusters were printed in a lush, bright green foliage motif; ruched minidresses boasted an abstract pattern of fuchsia florals; and tiered shirtdresses in crisp white cotton recalled the 1950s with wide belts cinching the waist. Making an entrance is of paramount importance chez Battaglia. You wouldn\u2019t go wrong with a sexy bustier dress in golden lam\u00e9. But the collection\u2019s cherry on the cake was the unabashed homage the designer paid to the fabulous Marilyn Monroe, via an almost identical rendition of the glorious white pliss\u00e9 dress the actress wore in Billy Wilder\u2019s The Seven Year Itch. It certainly raised the collection\u2019s temperature, but what\u2019s not to love?

Johnson, active during the \u201930s and \u201940s, and of photographer Gordon Parks, who was prominent in documentary photojournalism from the \u201940s through the \u201970s. Their imagery sparked the narrative background for Marras\u2019s Resort collection, a fictional tale of two girlfriends working as tailors in Harlem, patching together an extravagant wardrobe using whatever was on hand. The designer played with blown-up volumes, bright colors, and the patchwork techniques he favors, whipping up imaginative pieces that often exude the lived-in flair that suits his sentimental approach. Sequined arabesques and Gobelin-inspired brocades decorated knits, abstract florals were printed on corsets bonded on poplin shirts, and sweaters featuring geometric motifs were split open and stitched onto tiered tulle dresses. Lace was lacquered and paired with damask, Prince of Wales checkered wool was splattered with black ink drops, and humongous peonies bloomed improbably on Klein-blue velvet. The quirky mash-up coalesced rather spiritedly via a kaleidoscopic color-block palette of yellow, turquoise, pink, periwinkle, and Tiffany green. Such imaginative ebullience was counterbalanced by more sedate tailored pieces: Shapely cut suits with batwing jackets had a seductive vintage \u201940s flair; little coats were streamlined and, by Marras\u2019s standards, rather unfussy; sequined pencil skirts paired with matching polo shirts had a neat silhouette. Yet the collection\u2019s sweetest note was the figurines inspired by William H. Johnson\u2019s drawing. Patched or knitted on oversize sweaters and tees, they were a loving homage to a major artist, whose work celebrated African American culture."}, {"Designer": "Kitx", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "At first, it sounded as though Kit Willow said she named her collection \u201cRewording Nature.\u201d But adjusting for her charming Aussie accent, it turned out she had said \u201cRewilding.\u201d Interesting\u2014but what did she mean? In a literal sense, she was referring to the conservation approach that helps repair and restore biodiversity. But to see the abstracted, multicolored animal stripes on handwoven hemp was to sense her creative interpretation as well. Produced in Belgium, this hemp was the foundation fabric for her Resort lineup\u2014and not just because of its soft, linen-like appearance. Willow, whose brand ethos is ethical and sustainable, noted that it requires less water to manufacture, grows quickly, and doesn\u2019t attract insects. The main attraction, a blue workwear jumpsuit\u2014aka the \u201cfuture suit\u201d\u2014featured pockets sized to hold a water bottle and a reusable coffee cup (empty, obviously). She repeated these pockets on the \u201cglobal nomad trench\u201d even though it\u2019s hard to imagine women stashing such items in their clothes instead of their bags. With Kitx, it\u2019s the ingenuity that counts. Elsewhere, buttons in upcycled resin and the sequins made from PET bottles (thanks to the Sustainable Sequin Company) underscored the completeness of Willow\u2019s commitment. If a three-piece suit (in lieu of a vest, a flounced corset top) was the most polished look, she also created a concert tee starring an endangered tiger\u2014playful with serious undertones. Willow nonetheless makes it a point to keep her messaging to a minimum. \u201cResort is traditionally about beautiful dresses for all the winter season parties,\u201d she said.

Nellie Partow might be the most under-the-radar name on the list (Khaite and Tommy Ton\u2019s line, Deveaux, also come to mind), but the success of Partow\u2019s label suggests that won\u2019t be the case for long. It\u2019s stocked in the best stores and websites, from Le Bon March\u00e8 to Forty Five Ten, and in recent seasons, she\u2019s tapped some of the most iconic models to star in her lookbooks: Amy Wesson, Tasha Tilberg, and for Resort, Karen Elson. All three are notably in the 40-year-old age range and look particularly confident in Partow\u2019s clothes. These are simple, ultra-luxurious items for grown-ups\u2014though Taylor Hill, who was a baby when these women started their careers, also looked great in her Partow suit at last week\u2019s CFDA Awards. It\u2019s impossible not to zero in on the first three looks of Resort, where Elson\u2019s trademark orange-red hair is reflected in the sunset stripes of a silk blouse, trousers, and midi dress. Those colors are bolder than anything Partow has done in the past, and will speak to the woman who appreciates simplicity but wants to dress with a bit more exuberance in 2020. (Partow\u2019s signature gold-painted cable-knits would fit the bill, too.) Color aside, it\u2019s worth looking a bit closer at the twisted construction of those striped pieces: What appears to be a built-in, permanent detail is actually two long strips of silk you twist and tuck or leave hanging. On the long-sleeved dress, the concept lent a nice bit of waist definition in lieu of Partow\u2019s typically straight, gently oversize dresses. Elsewhere, Partow focused on similar styling tweaks: A toffee-color trench had a single turquoise strap around the cuff; a crisp white blazer had one contrast-color lapel; and a simple black V-neck dress was cinched with two extra-long belts high on the ribcage. Similarly, a blazer with exaggerated cargo pockets came with two D-ring belts: one in camel, one in bright blue. For a designer focused on tailoring, that jacket was a departure in its casual, utilitarian feeling\u2014though it goes without saying that Partow approached it with the same care and precision of a tuxedo. Styled with matching slim trousers, it looked like a New Yorker\u2019s ultimate day-to-day uniform. After work, she could change into the actual tuxedo in crisp ivory."}, {"Designer": "Nomia", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "There\u2019s a lot to unpack in the athleisure boom, but the simple takeaway for most women is that it\u2019s easy, comfortable, and flattering.

They shouldn\u2019t give up on fashion full stop, though, especially when there are little labels like Yara Flinn\u2019s Nomia making sleek, vaguely sporty pieces that are just as comfy\u2014but much more considered\u2014than actual workout gear. Nomia\u2019s Resort collection seems particularly suited to those busy women, partly because Flinn\u2019s own life has gotten extraordinarily busier: She gave birth to her first baby last year. It\u2019s understandably shifted the way she thinks about clothing and style; she\u2019s awake at 5 a.m. and zigzags Manhattan and Brooklyn on the subway, so she can\u2019t exactly abide a rigid trouser or complicated dress. Resort was essentially her ideal new-mom wardrobe: lots of separates (because it\u2019s difficult to nurse in a dress!) in bold, juicy colors and roomy but not oversized silhouettes. Most of those pieces came in the luxe, techy materials Flinn has been using for several years. The new-mom bonus is that they resist wrinkles and are typically machine-washable. A cool Japanese poly blend felt particularly compelling on a hooded anorak and a white ruched blouse, which had the look of a classic shirt but won\u2019t crease. She reported that her wavy-ribbed midiskirts were already a hit with buyers, including the version in blush lam\u00e9. In one look the skirt was styled with a striped turtleneck that had a dense, weighty feel to it; worn with the matching cropped trousers, it would make for a surprisingly elegant sweatsuit. Some girls might wear it with sneakers, but Flinn made a strong case for her cut-out white mules. They\u2019re made of buttery vegan leather (you\u2019d never know it wasn\u2019t the real thing) and come with shiny conical heels. Would that look still be considered athleisure? Or is it ath-luxury? Maybe it\u2019s neither.

He found himself revisiting his own archive in his research, specifically the textiles with which he first made his mark. Using his signature east-meets-west shapes as a blueprint, Zhang reworked the black and red lace that appeared in his debut collection. Patchworked with graphic windowpanes of that pretty lace, the empire-line mini and maxi chiffon dresses proved that upcycling can work just as nicely on the red carpet as anywhere else\u2014and that\u2019s bound to be music to the ears of Zhang\u2019s high-profile clientele, such as Gemma Chan, Naomi Campbell, and the like. Zhang isn\u2019t the kind to reinvent the wheel each season; instead, he gently evolves his familiar monochromatic looks with texture and color. That said, he has shifted his design process to better align with the transitional nature of Resort, like many of his peers in London and New York.

Conditions at the salt dome are beyond extreme: It\u2019s 420 feet below sea level, the salt is 1.25 miles thick, and below the salt is a magma chamber. The air is toxic, and the hot springs spew acid not water. A French scientific expedition explored the site last year. Apparently Dallol looks a lot like early earth, when land began emerging from the sea, and studying it could help illuminate how life first formed on our planet. That\u2019s a particularly urgent subject now that human action (or inaction, in the case of global warming) seems poised to end much of life on this planet. One million species are currently threatened with extinction, a U.N. report revealed last month. The photos of Dallol are mind-blowing: The place looks dangerous yet beautiful. You can understand why Gabi, Ange, and Adi were taken with them, but the designers did nothing as first-degree as reproducing the images. Instead the acid yellow of the site\u2019s sulfur formations dominates the season\u2019s palette, providing an electric counterpoint to the black-and-white landscape illustrations they abstracted from the work of their artist friend Stanley Casselman. The Casselman prints look topographical, like mountain ranges photographed from above. Their arabesques are reproduced in the clothes\u2019 sculptural silhouettes, many of which are riffs on past shapes, like the judo-inspired tabi pants and the drop-crotch harem pants. Concerns about climate change have obliquely inspired another element of the collection: the simple-looking T-shirts and sleeveless tees made from single pieces of material. The technique requires some pretty funky, next-level pattern-cutting, but the message is straightforward: It\u2019s time for all of us to do more with less."}, {"Designer": "Natasha Zinko x Duo", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Expansive, impetuous, and loud, Natasha Zinko\u2019s clothes inhabit a broad spectrum that runs from \u201cwhat the hell\u201d to \u201chell yeah\u201d and everywhere in between.

Zinko\u2014like so many others on the carousel right now\u2014spoke of sustainability issues, here via some pieces featuring panels of two-year-old upcycled floral fabric from past collections used as swishy, sashy belts or layered as ruffles at the frayed hems of a pair of denim cut-off shorts. A non-recycled cashmere sweater featuring the recyclable three-arrow triangle motif and the statement \u201cI can afford it\u201d in Cyrillic script was another slightly enigmatic contribution to the global emergency. This season Zinko\u2019s photo-print, based on her own shots of a flower market in her home city of Odesa, Ukraine, were used to blinding effect on ornamentally technical-wear and shirting. Alongside that were some workwear-inspired pieces including a men\u2019s pant in fine-chino cotton made to resemble a pair of overalls half-worn, with the sleeves slung around the waist.

Scott\u2019s Los Angeles show was underpinned by a trip-down-memory-lane nostalgia, yet more importantly, it was literally screaming with humor and modernity. It all worked; the payoff was kind of brilliant. Held at Universal Studios\u2014along the same set that served as Wisteria Lane on Desperate Housewives\u2014Scott sent forth his models as trick-or-treaters in a foggy twilight. There were references to horror-core galore: Redrum printed vertically on a dress (The Shining); neon green leather with trompe l\u2019oeil stitches (Frankenstein); a model shrieking and banging on doors (an homage to Drew Barrymore\u2019s character in Scream, which Scott mentioned was one of the night\u2019s main inspirations). Yet even though there were a lot of silver-screen throwbacks, the takeaway was very Stranger Things (season three airs in three weeks). It felt like suburbia blanketed in sugary faux-creepiness, a polychromatic Edward Scissorhands-ian moment for the Instagram era. \u201cI wanted to take the most mundane, beautiful, manicured, perfect setting because that\u2019s where the darkest things always happen,\u201d said Scott. He suggested platform boots in pumpkin orange, extra-oversize sweatshirts sewn through with even more oversize ruffles, graphic trope-y tees and spider-web-studded moto jackets. A relatively subtle dress read \u201cTrick or Chic.\u201d At the finale, a \u201ccorpse bride\u201d walked out, holes burned into the hem of her wedding gown. \u201cVera Wang can't have all the business!\u201d Scott joked. The show was a little tough to see in the shadows, and the styling was as maxed out as it could be. What really resonated\u2014and thrilled\u2014was the popcorn smack of disruptiveness that Scott brought to the block. We live in a time where it\u2019s almost impossible to get noticed, or, somewhat counterintuitively, we don\u2019t know what will get noticed. Moschino is one of those brands where the viewer is mostly aware of what to anticipate, and this is where Scott so smartly surprised.

Research into Memphis\u2019s key figures led Sui to a palette of Pop colors\u2014azure, jade, bright coral\u2014that, as a New Wave regular at the Mudd Club, were familiar to Sui from Fiorucci adverts and MTV graphics. So there was her bridge. In the collection, the Maripol-does-Memphis spirit came through in color-blocked maxi dresses, metallic shirred minis, and a delightfully funky flame print cut into windbreakers, blouses, and floppy little dresses.

At first glance, the clean lines and restrained palette of her clothes might lead you to connect \u201cpurity\u201d with minimalism, but there\u2019s nothing slick or cold about them; even the simplest pieces have a sense of the hand, be it a raw edge, a sculptural curve, or, most compellingly, a gestural twist or drape. The satin cascading down one side of a bustier and the subtle twist at the neckline of a side-slit tunic looked offhand, but came down to a complicated process of hand-sculpting, tucking, and stitching, all done in Moscone\u2019s New York atelier. \u201cEvening tops\u201d in general are a strength for Moscone, from those draped satin blouses to her sculptural curved bustiers\u2014typically in a restrained palette of black, navy, or silver, and always styled with easy trousers and cushioned leather sandals. Those looks will feel familiar to women who have seen Moscone\u2019s recent collections; what felt newer were the sheer blouses and slip dresses in a pastel marble print. It was loosely inspired by Helen Frankenthaler, but each iteration was a Moscone original: She set up a kid\u2019s inflatable pool in her apartment as a makeshift marbling operation, a painstaking process that involves swirling different paints on the surface of a thick, seaweed-based solution. A lacy marbled silk slip dress was especially pretty, shown with a whisper-sheer layer of \u201ctufted\u201d white flowers on top.

According to Fran Stringer, their wholesale partners in the \u2019Burgh sell classic Pringle sweaters and scarves by the bucketload, so the addition of this new store should make those figures overfloweth. Stringer\u2019s job is to perpetuate and cultivate that market for the classic expression of Pringle while broadening its parameters, and ideally its audience, via these collections. As ever, she looks to the former to fuel the latter. Here, again, the argyle pattern was the decorative focus. To modernize it Stringer subtracted the \u201crakers\u201d\u2014an argyle-phile\u2019s term for the horizontal lines in the pattern\u2014or sometimes distorted by elongation of the diamond grid, or again sometimes zoomed in to create vaguely jockey-ish colors on diagonal split sweaters. The chunky-looking sweaters in oversize cable pattern were air-spun to give the appearance of substance with the seasonal attractions of weightlessness. There was a neo-bobby soxer feel to some of Stringer\u2019s roomily armholed, close-to-cropped shapes in her modernized argyle, which\u2014despite being a pleasing pattern\u2014was effectively zhooshed with the addition of an Escher-esque intarsia floral in 70/30 cashmere/lambswool sweaters and kimono cardigans. That other great Pringle trope, the twinset, was reset in\u2014you guessed it\u2014an argyle, this one expressed via texture in the absence of rib knit.

A masculine white poplin shirt was outlined by a scalloped organza trim in contrasting color; a ribbed cotton sweater was bonded at the front of a poplin blouse in discreet trompe l\u2019oeil mode; what looked like a cotton lace jacket was actually part of a fit-and-flare black cotton dress.

That typically comes down to relatively simple silhouettes and a specific instinct for color: Resort\u2019s blown-up hibiscus print came in a curious mix of burgundy, navy, orange, and lilac, for instance, not your usual brights and pastels. On a sleek, straight-fitting dress, the effect was graphic and elegant\u2014hardly something you\u2019d reserve just for the beach. The other prints followed a similar ideology, like a slate-blue and orange foulard Beattie lifted from a vintage blanket and a silky jacquard of ruby and cobalt flowers. Those rich colors and textures were a loose interpretation of what Beattie remembers seeing in fortune tellers\u2019 salons (New Yorkers will be familiar); the quilted-over jumpsuit made from dozens of strips of printed textiles was particularly evocative of that layered, vaguely darker mood. It will look just right come November, when this collection begins arriving in stores.

Cheetahs, zebras, and meerkats were reproduced in sequins on cashmere sweaters and the back of a split-hood woolen varsity jacket. A series of dresses and shirts shown here in navy blue were decorated with an abstract giraffe pattern. Out of Africa, there was an attractive tailoring story that teamed a high-lapeled jacket in gray check with a sporty midcalf elastic-waist pleated skirt. A three-tiered skirt and roomy overcoat came in the same fabric, which played well against Bengal-striped shirtdresses. Lupfer sprinkled his pieces with pretty pale blue floral paillettes, but only sparsely: This is a designer whose long-held maximalism has become increasingly dialed-down. Instead, the punctuation marks that ran through this collection were bold thick strokes of black writ in scarves, headbands, and twisted sash belts at the bosom or waist. His incisor-flashing parted lips logo featured on knits and was incorporated into a grid pattern that appeared on prim shirtdresses in the pale blue of the paillettes as well as a pink.

But of course the synergy won\u2019t hurt. The Grimaldi sisters\u2019 exuberant yet cool style feels overdue for examination, and Serafini is just the guy to do it. The \u201980s have been a preoccupation of his since he joined Philosophy, only typically he\u2019s referenced another beauty of the era, Brooke Shields. All that to say this was Philosophy at its most confident and charming, with playful pieces for day and evening. Serafini designs a full wardrobe, from denim and knitwear right on up to party dresses. Given his muses many of the knits were marini\u00e8re striped, and the jeans were high-waisted and baggy, which is shaping up to be the silhouette of the moment. He cut a pair of salopettes with ruffled straps in light-wash denim, as well as in a truly supple black eco-leather that also turned up on shorts and an era-appropriate round-shoulder jacket. A red-and-black tweed was lifted from a photo of Caroline. Serafini, being the fashion historian he is, said Caroline was wearing Chanel Haute Couture from Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s first collection in the photo. That will be lost on millennials, who tend not to be too interested in history. But they\u2019ll respond to his going-out tops and cocktail dresses, which are categories where Serafini\u2019s attention to detail comes out.

Save for a crinkled goddess dress that nodded to the artist\u2019s love of Roman mythology and gold eyelet looks that mimicked some of his rough-hewn textures, the collection was rooted in the moment. Women want versatile separates with a touch of mirth, and Siriano gave them just that. French painter Gee-Gee Collins received a shout out, her abstract portraits provided the inspiration for a face print that made its way onto long-sleeved crop tops and double-breasted blazers with portrait collars. The museum moment allowed for the introduction of new fabrications like ombre pleated silk and a metallic jersey knit that clung to models\u2019 bodies and revised versions of the outr\u00e9 evening silhouettes Siriano specializes in. There were still ballgowns\u2014including a glittering white number that verged into bridal territory\u2014but many looks were broken into separates to give clients a range of styling options. Voluminous ruffled skirts were attached to corseted tops and paired with pants, while a navy overcoat accented with layers of tulle made for an arresting statement.

However, during her interview with Vogue Runway\u2014held in advance of a friends-and-family preview at L.A.\u2019s Night Gallery, before the pre-collection relocates to Paris for sales and press later this month\u2014Schloss herself accidentally spoke it as wylin. She laughed, a little dismayed. She was nervous. Those nerves can melt away for the time being\u2014this designer is onto something. Schloss\u2019s first effort is accessible yet wild-side eclectic, offering a deft mix of art-school flare with disciplined calibration. It either soapily shimmers with \u201990s-era euphoria for evening, or stands fortified with strong, salable sportswear for day. It\u2019s not so common to see ideas that are uncompromisingly singular in aesthetic yet broad in appeal. Boiled down: These clothes are going to be popular. Schloss is a Parsons womenswear alum, and her expertise was furthered while working for Kanye West\u2019s brand, Yeezy. In fact, West is Schloss\u2019s investor. Her startup is reportedly his first venture in what will be a stable of labels\u2014West approached Schloss at Yeezy about a year ago, and she began working independently, with his blessing and bank-rolling, last November. Through an email, West would only say \u201cMaisie has always had a strong perspective and we\u2019re truly pleased with her first collection.\u201d He likely wanted to limit his commentary in order to let his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 hold the spotlight (or let the designs speak for themselves; Schloss said West\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian West, would be \u201creceiving a box\u201d). It\u2019d be interesting to hear, though, what West specifically saw in Schloss\u2014he\u2019s well-known for his style instincts (and, frankly, his trend-creating). There must have been something he noticed early. Back to the clothes: Polychrome jersey dresses with raw-cut necklines featured semi-animalistic prints, overlaid with biodynamic ovate blotting. \u201cThese are the backbone of the collection,\u201d said Schloss. \u201cThe fabric can be printed beautifully. I was looking at gymnastics costumes, and the cut-outs that they have, which look so gestural on the body. And I was also looking at pictures of robotics.\u201d Some tops had loops at the sleeve, which slipped over the middle finger, creating an extended and pointed arm. \u201cI think gymnastics and robots mirror my work well, in that I am systematic and regimented in how I operate, but the outcome looks organic.\u201d Elsewhere, there were paint-by-numbers tees, which will come with Sharpies so that buyers can customize the pieces at will. Additionally, Schloss layered in hyper-cropped and cinched synthetic-coated cotton jersey jackets, perforated knits, and python-patterned separates. At retail, the highest price garment \u201cmaxes out around $1,000.\u201d If there were shades of Demna Gvasalia\u2019s Balenciaga, they weren\u2019t problematic\u2014Rihanna\u2019s recent Fenty unveiling had those shades, too. Rather, this was Schloss\u2019s distillation of the times at hand, and it\u2019s not exactly an easily definable moment. Is fashion appropriate for political commentary? Is fashion too wasteful? Has fashion gotten too excessive? Does anyone even care about fashion anymore? Whatever one\u2019s take, Maisie Wilen lands as a needed upper\u2014it is serious design with a fun, tangy aftertaste. The outcome: clothes that one wants to wear and to see based solely on desire, detached from the weightiness of the bigger picture.

At first, he fell for the British painter Hannah Gluckman\u2019s flowers. It wasn\u2019t until he began researching Gluck, as she was called, that he learned she was a gender non-conformist who wore her hair cropped short and sported jackets and ties just as often as fancy lace and jacquard frocks. The chance discovery produced a rich collection that spanned the gamut from menswear-inflected tailoring (more than usual for this designer) to delicate dresses. Lippes doesn\u2019t wear his politics on his sleeve, but he very much believes in inclusivity. These clothes will charm the women he spends weeks on the road cultivating at the country\u2019s best stores. He says customers are savvier than ever about fabrics, and he\u2019s developed some beauties. Consider the variety of lace on offer, from the most ephemeral Chantilly to successively more substantial mohair-embroidered lace and corded lace stitched with silk. Consider the range of knits he\u2019s had made in Madagascar, from fine to lofty, including polo and crewneck cashmeres intarsia\u2019d in a discreet \u201cA\u201d pattern. And consider the long dress made from burnout gold silk velvet re-embroidered with tiny silver threads. There hasn\u2019t been a more captivating material this season. As for the tailoring, which season by season becomes a bigger part of his business, Lippes likes the look of full, slightly flared culottes. He cut them in myriad fabrics and paired them with knee-high boots dripping in silk fringe\u2014a surprising, kicky combination. Volumes were likewise effusive on two other looks: a blush pink jumpsuit paired with a matching pouf-sleeve shirt and an oversize white tuxedo shirt buttoned to the neck and worn with black pants.

Tailoring in loud colors and patchwork floral dresses\u2014both keyed to the current trends\u2014are part of his regular repertoire. A Prince of Wales jumpsuit was a highlight in the former category. In the latter, we preferred a floral-print belted cotton shift whose almost ladylike demeanor disrupted the collage-print, pleated, oversize formula.

To accompany her central cherub print, Walker leaned into her rococo references, best illustrated by the standout silk midi dress with a smocked bodice, puffed sleeves, and a delicate flounce at the hem. To offset them, however, she wisely included several clean, fitted rib knits and plenty of soft tencel-blended chambray separates to ground the collection. Yet it was hard not to get swept up by her skyward fantasy: the swirl of a pale blue organza skirt, the gorgeous ring of cobalt tie-dye on a white peasant blouse and skirt. \u201cThey\u2019re streaky lines, cutting through like clouds,\u201d she said.

Erdem\u2019s lookbook, with all its typically eccentric \u201ctwinning\u201d of models, was a collaboration with Kamara too; they worked together with the young photographer Sam Rock to create the sense of madcap, frenetic energy and movement in the poses of the girls as they work their floral prints, billowy sleeves, and headwraps. It may be an interim collection, which needs to show range and variety, but there\u2019s no less Erdem-esque elaboration and magic going on in touches like his penchant for oversize bows, printed tights to match dresses, and, lately, polka dots. What stands out most is the grand fabulosity of his holiday party dresses\u2014particularly the paired versions, one white, one black, of a high-waisted zigzag lace-trimmed dress, and finally the dreamy, demi-caped chiffon scattered with minute polka dots, whose delicacy can only be described as a confection."}, {"Designer": "Carolina Herrera", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Wes Gordon has been heading up the house of Carolina Herrera for a year now, and he\u2019s officially settled in.

There\u2019s often a temptation to flex\u2014to start fresh. This collection is the success that it is because it\u2019s absolutely true to the brand\u2019s roots, but quite youthful and fresh. Gordon had the clever idea of playing up Herrera\u2019s Venezuelan side. She was born in Caracas, though she\u2019s lived most of her life on New York\u2019s Upper East Side. These clothes straddle that divide. The colors, patterns, and embroideries of Latin America have been applied to the kind of occasion dresses that Herrera\u2019s \u201cuptown\u201d clientele requires. A standout clingy ribbed knit dress was printed in vibrant serape blanket stripes, and a strapless gown has been embellished in the traditional embroideries of Oaxaca. Gordon also took Herrera-isms like pouf sleeves and trench gowns, and spiced them up. To counterpoint all the effusiveness, there was dandified tailoring, which was modeled by his dates to the CFDA Awards earlier this week, the actress Lili Reinhart and the model Sasha Luss. Gordon said the Spanish translation of joie de vivre is alegr\u00eda de vivir, and this outing had it.

She fell instantly in love with the culture and with the lush gardens that breathe fresh air into the city. Mote was so moved by these spans of urban green that she crafted her Resort 2020 collection around their natural palette of browns and greens, their linear shapes, and their zen-inducing qualities. The resulting garments were some of her best yet, mostly because of the pure craftsmanship and the creative love she poured into them. There was a bit more texture and volume than usual, which gave depth to the collection. With pieces like a light-olive dress with a tiered skirt, a sand-colored micro-pleat dress, and a sheer, pleated tie-strap top and matching trousers, there were also more options in terms of evening-ready garments. Mote had day options, too, like her go-to utility pants done this season in a new wash of denim. The capsule of black viscose bodysuits and biker shorts, which she styled with softer items like a cotton peasant skirt and a silky wrap top with a low, blunt neckline and sheer balloon sleeves, also fit in nicely with this collection. Elsewhere, Mote played with the idea of the prairie dress, her version done in a light-gray-and-white geometric check print. It didn\u2019t look like all of the other prairie dresses we\u2019ve grown accustomed to seeing in our Instagram feeds, and that\u2019s the magic of Mote\u2019s clothes.

That doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t fit the mold of an exacting, rigorous designer and tailor: Even his \u201csimple\u201d blazers are meticulously cut and surprisingly light, and usually come with covered buttons that \u201cdisappear,\u201d as he puts it. To think about that a little deeper, the idea of creating something that\u2019s not really meant to be seen is a pretty poignant intention in our age of overexposure and flashy Instagram statements. It\u2019s those details and unflashy tweaks that have made Officine G\u00e9n\u00e9rale a favorite of discerning men and women around the world, including here in the United States (Mah\u00e9o reported it\u2019s his biggest e-commerce market).

It\u2019s the pants that will make many women into OG believers: With suiting, it\u2019s surprisingly difficult to find a trouser that\u2019s neither wide-leg nor skinny, and Mah\u00e9o\u2019s are slim yet relaxed. They\u2019re an interpretation of his staple men\u2019s pants but are in no way a sized-down version; these were designed specifically for women.

A generation ago, influenced by Alexander McQueen\u2019s famous bumsters, the trend was for super-low, just-this-side-of-indecent rises. For Resort 2020, we appear to be in the midst of an \u201980s revival, which was the last time the world saw pants like these: very high-waisted, and often paper-bagged with an attached belt.

Retro proportions aside, the jacket tucked into pants is officially a 2020 thing. You\u2019ll be seeing more of this look, and you might even be tempted to try it yourself, judging by the Resort collections so far.

That\u2019s a testament to the strength of Natacha Ramsay-Levi\u2019s vision and the global relevance of her design signatures. Today, the Western fashion crowd traveled to Shanghai to take in the brand\u2019s Resort 2020 show, which was staged on the rooftop of the Long Museum at sunset. The decision to put on a show for its Resort collection, and to set it against the hazy skies of China\u2019s bustling metropolis, was made more than a year ago. Business was the draw, with the luxury market bigger than booming throughout Asia, but the city is a good fit with Ramsay-Levi\u2019s sensibilities. A lover of Chinese cinema, she had compiled backstage dozens of stills from her favorite movies by Jia Zhangke, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Zhang Yimou, Bi Gan, and Lou Yi, as a de facto moodboard, and was beaming over the fact that one of her favorite actresses, Shu Qi, would be sitting front row. (The soundtrack to Millennium Mambo, Qi\u2019s breakout film, scored Ramsay-Levi\u2019s runway-debut Chlo\u00e9 collection, in 2017.) Another film, Three Times, by Hsiao-Hsien, informed Ramsay-Levi\u2019s decision to explore China\u2019s rich history, drawing on its empirical eras, its Art Deco period, and its contemporary buzz. The designer\u2019s nods to Chinese culture were small but poignant, such as the side buttons on a floral dress that evoked a qipao, and two prominent flag-red looks. There were also tiny embroideries inspired by traditional Chinese handwork. Ramsay-Levi\u2019s sense of cool\u2014the layering of skirts over pants, the sneakers with skirts, and the piles of golden jewelry\u2014meshes well with the Shanghainese culture. Worn by a majority Chinese cast of local models, the clothing took on a lively new dimension; if Chlo\u00e9 has long been the ur-brand for Parisian je ne sais quoi, it proved it could also be that for Shanghai\u2019s miao bu ke yan on the runway tonight. But that\u2019s enough about vibes. Not enough attention is paid to celebrating Ramsay-Levi\u2019s skill as a designer. The dresses might be flippy and floaty, but Ramsay-Levi constructs them with the precision and rigor of a would-be couturier. Her best this season were the slips and smocks; they were as light as air\u2014which is especially good for a hot Chinese summer\u2014but still shapely. Voluminous, lacy skirts given structure by ribbon detailing also looked compelling paired with Ramsay-Levi\u2019s tailoring. (This season\u2019s slouchy trousers might be hard to pull off IRL, but they were convincing on the runway.) If you caught a new hint of sexiness in these looks, especially the finale number with its catty sandal, you\u2019re on right track. A tough womanliness came through this season more than ever."}, {"Designer": "Jason Wu", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Jason Wu readily admits that he isn\u2019t a logo guy. In his everyday life, the designer sticks to a simple uniform of black tees and hoodies, and in his work, he favors elegance over anything outwardly emblematic. This season however, Wu challenged his own bias against logo mania by introducing a \u201cJW\u201d monogram on several of his pieces, including a gray knit crewneck sweatshirt and a red cashmere hoodie. The new signage worked within Wu\u2019s Resort mix, especially when it was mixed in with pieces that are more recognizably Wu-ian: a brown leather wrap skirt, boxy cropped trousers, a structured, belted jacket. The non-logo pieces made marks on their own with luxury-grade details, even if the pricing on this Jason Wu line is more approachable (his high-end pieces now live under the Jason Wu Collection umbrella). Inspired by Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s Rive Gauche collection for Spring 1968, Wu referenced the late French couturier\u2019s safari jackets with a cropped, contemporary version of his own. Nods to Saint Laurent could also be seen in the oversized sleeves Wu added to easy day dresses, as well as in the black and white dot printed pussy-bow blouse. But even with the nostalgia woven into this new collection, it still came from his own point of view. The red sleeveless dress with cascading chiffon was particularly lovely, as well as recognizably Wu, and his sleeveless belted wool coat worn over a T-shirt and pants was effortlessly cool."}, {"Designer": "Lorod", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "On a perfect sun-drenched June afternoon, designer Lauren Rodriguez brought her latest for Lorod to the New York Marble Cemetery, a lovely little green space tucked down a secret alley in the East Village. It was a clever choice, given the two-year-old label\u2019s own status as a hidden gem in New York, though that designation won\u2019t last long. Over the course of two hours, a slew of downtown creatives came to recline on raw-edged denim blankets with bottles of Pac\u00edfico beer and treats from a sumptuous summer buffet\u2014ice blocks piled with split coconuts and sugar-crusted cubes of Castipan guava paste, and plastic bags filled with slices of ripe papaya and mango with the requisite chili salt on the side. It was a picture-perfect affair, dedicated to Rodriguez\u2019s Mexican-American background. Those familial roots shaped the Lorod story this season. \u201cMy dad was a migrant worker in California, and growing up he was one out of 13 kids,\u201d Rodriguez explained. On a recent trip home, she found herself digging through old family photos and fell in love with her aunts\u2019 and uncles\u2019 \u201970s and \u201980s Chicano style. \u201cIt\u2019s such an underrepresented world, in fashion especially. It\u2019s close to home and I wanted to dive into that world a little bit.\u201d Hence the mangos with chili and the diverse cast of models with hair and makeup that nodded to Latinx beauty codes\u2014personal details that helped solidify the label\u2019s identity. Rodriguez also pulled from the Brazilian painter Amadeo Lorenzato and blended his colorful work with Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s starched textile sculptures and a photograph of a woman in winter, pulling frozen clothes off a line. (That directly inspired the starched and pressed garments that hung from four clotheslines, set up in the park for the show.) As always, she collaged these artistic references to reinterpret American classics with elements of craft. Yet Rodriguez was keen to note how Lorod has pushed past its early reputation for beautiful basics. \u201cI started wanting to make the perfect jean, the perfect shirt, but everyone wanted the more kitschy image pieces from us,\u201d she said, pointing to the quirky cut-out turtlenecks and abstract puzzle-like prints on the rack. \u201cPeople like coming to us for the more novel, fun things, which is exciting for us because we get to have more fun designing.\u201d Of course, it comes down to desirable clothes, and Lorod had plenty of them: the featherweight gingham tube top, the faded blue-and-yellow knit with trailing red string, the stiff black carpenter jean, the calf-length skirt suit with white whip stitching, and the spiral-cut yellowed-white shirtdress hemmed with baby blue thread. All loose, easy, yet impeccably put together\u2014the Lorod way."}, {"Designer": "Alena Akhmadullina", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Alena Akhmadullina loves fur. She loves embroidery. And she adores a print. These themes, often over-the-top, appeal to her Moscow-centered customer base, but they can seem too much for the U.S. market, especially at a time when designers are opting to go fur- and reptile-skin-free. Coming off of the Fall 2019 season in which she created a whole ball gown out of python, Akhmadullina seems to have cooled it on her signatures. Fur was used minimally and smartly on a boyish-cut jacket\u2014on the collar, peeking out of the placket, and on the sleeves. It was far less overwhelming than in previous outings. On a lighter note Akhmadullina is translating Western trends in her own way. There was a royal blue camp-type shirt printed with florals and a bedazzled cowboy fringe across a cashmere sweatshirt for an elevated yeehaw moment. While Akhmadullina did pare things down somewhat, one dress was fully embroidered with swans, a look that was based on an Alexander Pushkin poem. But not every reference to Akhmadullina\u2019s homeland was serious: Her take on Russo-athleisure, a soft blue hoodie had an embedded babushka scarf in the hood, was a hit."}, {"Designer": "Norma Kamali", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Fashion is finally catching up with Norma Kamali (again), this time largely on ideological and organizational fronts. This pioneering designer has always done things her own way; early on she decided to keep a certain distance from the fashion system, and her brand\u2019s longevity is tied both to the appeal of her designs and to her custom-made business model. Values that are being touted today, like comfort and responsibility, are things Kamali has addressed in her work for decades. What\u2019s more perfect to snuggle into than her famous sleeping bag coat, or more practical than garments that can be washed, eliminating the need for dry cleaning? Yes, as incredible as it seems, even the passementerie-trimmed velvets (shades of Queen Victoria) and the knockout sequined pieces Kamali showed for Resort can be thrown into the washing machine. (For the record, the designer recommends pairing heels with one of her silver spangled track suits for a statement-making New Year\u2019s Eve getup in which you can sit on the floor or dance all night.) One way designers are approaching sustainability is by switching their focus from trend-driven collections to ones with more classic pieces that, in theory, don\u2019t have expiration dates. Chez Kamali, there\u2019s lots of evidence that proves good design really does stand the test of time. The suspendered dirndl skirt she\u2019s showing this season is a reworking of an archival piece that she\u2019s seen popping up all over Instagram. A slim hooded column dress for night was revisited at the request of a stylist, and demand for the shirred \u201cslinky\u201d tube dress increased after Kendall Jenner wore a vintage one. These pieces, which you might think of as reissues by popular demand, are not line-for-line copies, but slightly updated to suit current-day needs. Remarkably, there is nothing retro-looking about them. Keeping things new is the fact that many of Kamali\u2019s designs are convertible and can be worn in multiple ways. For example, a seemingly simple shirt dress can be worn loose around the body, closed in such a way that it becomes a wrap dress, or worn open like a duster. That\u2019s a lot of bang for the buck."}, {"Designer": "Sandy Liang", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "What do Polly Pocket, The Virgin Suicides, and stick-on earrings have in common? According to designer Sandy Liang, a lot. To her, they each represent various moments of her upbringing: the precious, girly toys she played with, the fake jewelry she experimented with, and the Chinatown grannies she bonded with, most of whom dressed in floral-wallpaper-print dresses similar to those worn by the girls in Sofia Coppola\u2019s 1999 film depicting gorgeous, depressed teens trapped in suburbia. After reminiscing fondly about this time in her life, Liang decided to pay homage to all the bits and pieces that made her early youth so sweet. She channeled it all into her Resort 2020 collection, which is one of her strongest to date. Liang shot the clothes on her childhood block in Bayside, Queens, a strip of concrete and lawn that she calls her \u201chappy place.\u201d The clothes she presented today felt childlike but not twee, and because Liang knows how to be playful with her designs without falling into the trap of kitsch, she succeeded in making the familiar look desirable again. Take, for example, a baby doll dress in a metallic silver foil fabric, or a pair of early 2000s-style capri jeans with crystal studs linking the pockets. Liang said with a wide smile that these reminded her of the ultra short, tightly fitting denim she used to scoop up at Old Navy as a kid. The baby tee dress in bubblegum pink, embroidered with heart, moon, and star motifs shaped like her favorite plastic stick-on earrings, was also a sly blast from the past. Liang\u2019s use of balloon sleeves and mini hemlines befit a Millennial-aged Polly Pocket 2.0, as did the fuzzy faux-fur-trimmed cropped jacket and trench. With no detail spared this season, the designer also incorporated a soft floral print that she spotted in a film still from The Virgin Suicides. It was the wallpaper in the girls\u2019 bedroom, and she blew it up and incorporated it into those reinvigorated Chinatown granny frocks. Liang\u2019s clothes tend to have a personal bend to them, whether it\u2019s channeled through one or more of her friends-slash-muses, or through her heritage. But Resort 2020 was all her, and it paid off."}, {"Designer": "Victor Glemaud", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "To get his wheels turning for Resort, Victor Glemaud challenged himself to answer one question: If Grace Jones were a young aspiring musician in New York right now, what clothes would she wear to move through the world? As a style icon who\u2019s famous for her second-skin stage outfits and radical body paint, a wardrobe of slinky knits makes sense right off the bat. Surprisingly, though, it was an image of the singer in a graphic, cocoon-like cape that sparked Glemaud\u2019s research. With Champagne flowing and models dancing in optic black, white, and red motifs, Jones\u2019s spirit was in the air at the designer\u2019s presentation at the Jane Hotel last night. Glemaud understands the figure-flattering power of the right print, and his new ruffled pencil skirts came with angled white lines to accentuate a woman\u2019s best curves. Similarly the black body-conscious maxidress that was finished with a vertical harlequin pattern down the middle was cleverly forgiving without a whiff of frumpy. Glemaud is broadening his knitwear range with jackets; the slightly slouchy leopard-and-zebra-print piece hit a high note.

For Resort, she\u2019s come up with something she\u2019s calling with the \u201cquadro\u201d sleeve; cut full and three-quarter length, with a slanted wrist opening, it\u2019s quite sculptural, especially in a new organic faux fur that she sourced in Japan. That fake fur was just one of many interesting materials she played with this season. Considering the November timing of the collection\u2019s arrival in stores, she designed with an eye to holiday dressing. Pleated gold foil\u2014\u201cbohemian bling,\u201d she called it\u2014was cut into a tunic, an evening dress, and a tentlike shift, for her three types of clients: the \u201ccool girl,\u201d the \u201cBergdorf\u2019s shopper,\u201d and the \u201cart lady.\u201d There\u2019s also a striking woven jacquard shot through with glints of metallic thread; a vest and jacket made from looped rayon tape made by a Bolivian women\u2019s cooperative; and a lacquered raffia suggestive of leather from a distance. All of these require development; Cornejo is not picking them out at a mill. You can see why she might want a patent. On the more casual side, she\u2019s also going deeper into denim than she has before. At the moment, there\u2019s a trend for loose-fitting jeans with an \u201980s mien.

Reflecting on her recent success, it feels as though the designer has many more eponymous collections under her belt. In a matter of a few months she has launched bridal, relaunched handbags, and partnered with Lee Body Optix on a capsule collection of denim. Inspired by the contemporary artist Rana Begum and her installation \u201cThe Space Between,\u201d Cushnie designed this Resort collection thinking about linear forms. Begum\u2019s work focuses on repetitive patterns while applying elements of color and light, and it\u2019s this expression of the natural shape, structure, and order of artwork and architecture that has always moved the needle on Cushnie\u2019s design aesthetic, and continues to do so. Hanging on the racks, almost every piece of clothing looked as though it would mold to the body with ease (and any type of body, for that matter). A buttery brown suede dress with pleating at the bust was a definite highlight, as was the white, chunky ribbed-knit dress with inflated sleeves. A minty lime green suit with sharp paneling at the chest punctuated Cushnie\u2019s knack for tailoring. The floral embroideries inspired by Irving Penn photographs seen on several pieces in the collection were beautiful, but not necessarily as compelling as the sculptural details that Cushnie underscored elsewhere.

Sean Barron and Jamie Mazur are betting on it. Following a few seasons of tailoring trials\u2014starting with reworked vintage blazers, then venturing into made-in-Italy versions\u2014the duo introduced their first \u201creal\u201d head-to-toe suits for Resort 2020. In neutral mini-checks or navy pinstripes, they\u2019re just a touch shy of traditional: The blazers have strong (but not giant) shoulders and slightly elongated bodies, and the trousers are cropped with a subtle flare. Those tweaks might preclude certain women from wearing them in ultraformal offices, but dress codes are loosening up in most industries. Plus Barron and Mazur weren\u2019t really thinking about nine-to-five: They styled the checked suit with a T-shirt and sneakers, the way a Re/Done girl might wear it to a party. The navy suit was shown with the brand\u2019s other big news for Resort: Their first official shoes (the loafers they made last year were a collaboration with Bass). The square-toe, vintage-Frye-inspired boots had a pleasant heft to them and had been purposefully worn in and softened up. The sandy suede ankle boots in particular looked like they\u2019d been streaked with oil. They captured precisely what Barron and Mazur are hoping Re/Done can grow into: not just a denim brand but a resource for items you\u2019d normally find in a vintage store\u2014just with much better fabrics and fit. That\u2019s why women love the jeans; they\u2019re accessible yet have that feeling of a treasure you hunted down at the flea market. Similarly this collection\u2019s highlights\u2014the leather pilot jacket, the long military coat, and the tie-neck silk dress\u2014nodded to the \u201960s, the \u201940s, and the \u201980s without requiring any repairs or dry cleaning.

More precisely, it was 1998, a time when minimalism was at the forefront of the fashion conversation thanks to streamlined, chic clothing by the likes Helmut Lang and Calvin Klein. Azrou\u00ebl has always been inspired by clean lines and anatomically enhancing garments, and by pieces that are draped directly onto the body so that the fit is fluid and organic. But this season he felt particularly nostalgic for 1998, so he decided to take a more pared-back approach and return to his aesthetic roots. The designer revisited silhouettes like a cowled halter-neck minidress and sheer nude and white long-sleeved tops. A black slip skirt with a slit nearly hip high was also reminiscent of the days when Kate Moss would party in heels and a \u201cnaked dress.\u201d Azrou\u00ebl incorporated belted high-waist trousers into the mix, which felt less faithful to the designer\u2019s beginning years, but made a point in the context of how women are dressing in 2019. In contrast, the silver chain-link hardware on a couple of tops and dresses brought 1998 to mind perhaps a little too much.

The Elder Statesman\u2019s Greg Chait can happily say he was a few years ahead of that trend, though he\u2019d likely bristle at the word \u201ctrend\u201d and its wear-it-and-forget-about-it implications. His dip-dyed cashmere sweaters are about as special and heirloom-worthy as it gets. You get the sense that he isn\u2019t really worried about designers coming for his market share, either. He\u2019s fairly peerless in his attention to detail, commitment to working with global artisan groups, and intricate techniques, from individually hand-spun yarns to hand-painted dyes and antique hand-loom processes (much of which happen in his Los Angeles studio). To own a lofty, rainbow-splashed TES sweater is to know that a lot of hands worked on it, lending the dreamy look of the clothes a real-life sense of human connection. Chait\u2019s capacity for storytelling is similarly deep. Recent collections have touched on such of-the-moment topics as self-realization, talismans, and the cosmos, which got him thinking about life and the fine line between darkness and light. \u201cI realized, it\u2019s really like a game,\u201d he said while on the Bowery Hotel terrace. So he dove headfirst into how games simulate life, for better or for worse, from Saga and Nintendo circa the \u201990s to ancient Indian board games like Snakes and Ladders and Pachisi. He tapped British printmaker Sophy Hollington to create the massive backdrop of this lookbook, which Chait reported took two weeks to hand-paint in his L.A. studio. Her blown-up interpretation included a gigantic warped checkerboard; rainbow pathways like the kind you\u2019d see on a board game (though this reviewer instantly thought of Mario Kart\u2019s Rainbow Road); stars, suns, and moons, to bring in Chait\u2019s more philosophical take; actual snakes and ladders; and some palm trees because, you know, L.A. Chait and his team mirrored her work in the clothes\u2014see: the silk checkerboard quarter-zip Chait was modeling, the crewnecks with jacquard stars and gaming symbols, and the punchy color palette\u2014though many of the results were less literal. Trippy tie-dyed sherpa coats and joggers felt appropriately not-of-this-world, and Chait updated his signature cashmere crews with phrases like \u201cwild card\u201d or \u201cwin some, lose some\u201d\u2014gaming references to be interpreted in myriad ways."}, {"Designer": "Badgley Mischka", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Badgley Mischka is on the move.

Paillette-covered suiting added a welcome disco moment. Belted trousers and off-the-shoulder satin blouses are about as casual as Badgley Mischka gets, but each piece felt unfussy and wearable. Customers are increasingly conscious about comfort, even when selecting their eveningwear. Mischka and Badgley addressed these concerns by revisiting celebrity favorites and tempering the extravagance.

Belhumeur said she was drawn to the way Andersson gives simple, everyday scenes a dreamy quality\u2014a sentiment that lines up pretty well with Vince\u2019s m.o.

Standouts for Resort (an expansive collection that will be released over the course of a few months) included a buttery leather shirt that could be worn as a button-down or jacket; cropped gauchos in soft wool and silk; and an expanded range of tailoring, which is something of a new category for Vince.

Sleeveless tunics were worn as waistcoats layered over pleated skirts or proposed as fluid maxidresses. Shapes were elongated and feminine and the pattern play was compelling, a magpie mix of archival motifs and newly minted ones creating a sort of pictorial camouflage.

But maybe it\u2019s a disservice to consider Hoffman\u2019s clothes only in the context of the diaphanous, dreamy, typically loose silhouettes she\u2019s so known for. Sure, she cuts a great oversize suit, but there\u2019s always been a sense of warmth and sensuality at the heart of her label. It peeks through in Resort\u2019s new square-neck bodysuits, zipped-up denim skirts, and ribbed knit dresses with \u201cmagic boob\u201d details (i.e. ribs in concentric rings around the bust, a nod to Jean Paul Gaultier\u2019s \u201990s sweaters, Hoffman said). They\u2019re pieces that would make you feel sexy without being overexposed, and that would nudge you to embrace your femininity and inner magic. Speaking of magic, Hoffman has always been into female energy, spirituality, and mysticism, so Resort\u2019s shoot location was quite literally her dream come true. She\u2019s been going upstate for years, but only recently stumbled upon Roy Kanwit\u2019s Taconic Sculpture Park, where enormous marble and limestone heads, dragons, and otherworldly beings are hidden among the trees. Kanwit has described them as a connection between the earth and the heavens, and he seems to regard nature in a specifically feminine context; one of the heads is described as a woman he named \u201cMother Earth.\u201d That ties in with Hoffman\u2019s sustainable, low-impact materials: She wants to be able to walk among those statues and meditate on their significance without feeling like she\u2019s doing something contradictory with her own brand. By now, she should feel more than confident."}, {"Designer": "Proenza Schouler", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough are inching their way into their 40s. They\u2019re no longer New York\u2019s cool kids, but they\u2019re nothing if not cool.

Though they\u2019re working with traditional silhouettes\u2014pantsuits, shirtdresses, the trench\u2014and using a palette of khaki, gray, white, and black that could be considered conservative, they\u2019re good at imbuing their clothes with attitude. Their suit jackets are a prime example. Cut oversized through the shoulder but tapered at the waist, they\u2019re confident yet sensual. They\u2019d never be mistaken for men\u2019s tailoring, especially when they\u2019re tucked into double-belted trousers. The coat offering, which was also strong, included a gold-buttoned white coat in a spongy technical wool with bold black lapels, and a wintry sheepskin with insets at the side ribs to give it a snug, less overpowering silhouette. On the dress front, they returned to a successful shape, redoing the halter-bodice- and-pleated-skirt number of seasons back in stripes of black, white, and gold sequins. Their best new propositions had a more relaxed spirit. A drop-waist shirtdress and a pleated and belted midi dress with Jackson Pollock\u2013esque squiggles looked like smart investments: the kind of easy but memorable pieces a woman would return to again and again. Side note: Hernandez and McCollough have relaunched their advanced contemporary collection, White Label, to be less streetwear-inflected and more straightforwardly delineated from their main line. That seems like a smart move. They\u2019ve accumulated a lot of fans in their 16 years in business who have been priced out of Proenza Schouler.

This group served as the focus of Robert Rodriguez\u2019s Resort 2020 collection, a laid-back lineup of suits and separates that offer a traveler\u2019s twist on workwear essentials. Based in Los Angeles, Rodriguez has long endorsed the idea of chill fashion (his SoCal cool girls aren\u2019t the type to fuss about anything, let alone clothes), and the packing idea allowed him to take things one step further. Effortless was the key word, with familiar silhouettes pared down to their simplest form or crafted in wear-and-go materials. Trench coats came pre-crinkled in shades of cobalt blue and olive drab, while dress shirts were given an extra layer of transparent fabric. Even the sequined tartan, a rare moment of glitz, had a practical quality; the shiny overlay on blazers and overcoats prevents things from getting wrinkled. As always, Rodriguez offered new versions of his standards; a baggy white pinstripe suit was summery without resorting to seersucker, lightweight knits added a few weekend options, and a cropped take on his boxy blazers made for an appealing layering piece. The introduction of fresh ideas could have been taken further\u2014a brief segue into lace deserved more than a singular look\u2014but he ended things on a high note.

Where he once craved the expansive landscapes of Terrence Malick\u2019s Badlands and Days of Heaven, the British designer is now binge watching city-centric East Coast dramas such as Whit Stillman\u2019s Metropolitan. Released in 1990, the movie depicts a group of young, wealthy uptown New Yorkers during debutante season and was the jumping point for Resort. It\u2019s perhaps why the central piece in Coach\u2019s latest lineup is not a prairie dress but rather a tweedy cropped two-piece suit. For all its preppy origins, the collection still delivered a certain downtown attitude. Vevers cited perennial New York cool girl Chlo\u00eb Sevigny as an influence, and the new suits seem designed to be twisted and turned with kooky accessories the way she does best. With that in mind, the ankle-nipping retro running shoes took the current yen for clunky dad sneakers in a streamlined new direction. Vevers has always had a rich archive of handbags and outerwear to play with thanks to Bonnie Cashin, Coach\u2019s first designer, who helped make the leather goods brand a household name in the \u201960s and \u201970s. When it comes to clothes though, the history is considerably shorter. That got Vevers thinking about what a vintage piece of Coach might look like had ready-to-wear been produced way back when. To flesh out this revisionist picture, he used the classic horse and carriage motif. Replete with graphic racing stripes, the V-neck knit horse-and-carriage tanks and shrunken button-down shirts had an appealing thrift store quality that was in line with the personal, lived-in vibe of previous collections. More than anything though, that old-school pattern was especially fresh on Coach\u2019s new oversize shoppers and saddle bags.

Her rolodex of stylish, high society Manhattanites is pretty impressive: Karolina Kurkova, Aerin Lauder, and Lauren Santo Domingo, an early champion of the brand, were all perched on the front row. Oritz likes to roll out the Latin American hospitality wherever she goes, be that a rococo vestibule in Paris or a smart, mid-century eatery in midtown. With palm frond arrangements dotted around the room and freshly pressed juices served outside, the event was a pleasant start to a day jammed with showroom appointments. And yet if you were expecting a parade of brightly printed dresses, you\u2019d be sadly mistaken. Ortiz has been drawing on an earthier palette lately, and today she wiped the slate completely clean, opening the show with a gently corseted white blouse and matching skirt, a look you could easily imagine floating down Fifth Avenue. The only thing vaguely tropical here were the orchids in the models\u2019 hair. Still, Ortiz managed to import the spirit of her homeland in the collection all the same. What looked like a polka dot print turned out to be a ceramic-inspired motif on closer inspection, one that will be familiar to anyone who knows the country\u2019s traditional earthenware. The graphic pattern worked well on a brown \u201940s-style dress that was partially cinched at the waist with black velvet. That said, there was one floral print in the mix that was based on the angel trumpet, a flower known to be highly poisonous. \u201cBeautiful and dangerous,\u201d was how Ortiz described it. That moody sex appeal came through in a black party frock with a lace-front finish that was covered with the distinctive droopy purple and white blossoms. Ortiz has been moving away from her frothy ruffles, but the balloon-sleeved blouses that were sometimes fastened with a bow in the back will satisfy the continuing demand for going-out tops.

Why, you ask, have you been choosing all this time to wear garments that are stiff, sticky, and fussy with all manner of buttons and zips, when you could have been clothed in apparel with a gentle caress? One of Allegra\u2019s talents is for giving her slouchy, washed-down pieces a sense of formality: Although the vintage-style hoodies and sweats with placement tie-dye in her new collection went full-throttle casual, the emphasis here was on items with a high tone, like the single-button blazer and slinky jumpsuit in a fine rayon rib, or a silk leaf-print dress nipped ever-so-slightly at its elevated waist. Allegra simply doesn\u2019t see comfort as antithetical to chic. It\u2019s all in the detail, whether a bit of shirring at the pockets of a midiskirt, the dropped sleeve of a striped T-shirt dress, or the boxer-inspired cut of a pair of silk pajama pants that lay elegantly flat across the hips. Even the comforting elements are carefully considered; one of the standout pieces in this outing was a blush-toned, belted robe coat with tonal fleece lining inside that gave the coat both a hug-like feel and a distinctive quilted effect. At an appointment this morning, Allegra noted that she designs all of her pieces to be layered together, and one of the nicest subtleties of this collection was its way of creating slight variations within its constrained palette of red and ochre or blue and pale pink. A layered look might be monochromatic, but it never comes off as monolithic.

Veronica Miele Beard and Veronica Swanson Beard are at an advantage in that regard: They started their brand in 2010 with a capsule of blazers (and their famous zip-in dickies, which have become less of a focus of late) and have spent nearly a decade tweaking and elevating them. While some of their peers are just now jumping on the \u201cpower suit\u201d bandwagon\u2014often with too-trendy silhouettes or imperfect fits\u2014the Veronicas\u2019 jackets feel built to last.

Swanson Beard said they were looking at vacation photos from the \u201970s, when women traded their trim, cropped outfits of the prior decade for a looser, freer look. A sandy linen suit with pleated wide-leg trousers was a departure for VB in its generous, vaguely androgynous slouch, and looked a lot more compelling than their fitted blazers and skinny pants of seasons past. Styled with a camisole, it also spoke to the way many women are wearing a suit right now: on the weekend (or even on vacation) with strappy sandals or sneakers, not to the office. (That said, there were options for those in search of true 9-to-5 options, like a slimmer double-breasted suit in ivory crepe that will be sold in an extended size range.)

They\u2019re guaranteed to be popular. In general, though, Miele Beard and Swanson Beard are leaning into more of that grown-up, ladylike vibe. Even their signature ruched minidresses became flowy and ankle-length here, with abstracted prints in place of ditsy florals and pastels.

With Adeam, Hanako Maeda\u2019s perspective revolves around practicality, even if her designs are elevated. For her, it\u2019s not about playing to trends. This season she showcased her talents, crafting stylish, strong clothes for real, everyday women (plus Oprah, who just wore one of Maeda\u2019s dresses to an event). The Adeam Resort 2020 collection is based around a traditional Japanese woodblock art called kacho-ga. These prints depict soft, peaceful scenes of birds and flowers through serene colors like pastel peach and earthy green. Maeda personified the zen-like feeling one gets when viewing a kacho-ga through a lineup of clothes that were pretty and approachable but still disciplined as far as cut and silhouette are concerned. She achieved this through the asymmetrical long-sleeve peacoat and high-waisted bootleg pant, and through the double trench worn over a pressed ruffle dress. More playful tailoring was accented in a pair of patchwork jeans paired with a matching, off-the-shoulder denim corset top. Maeda incorporated beautiful freshwater pearl detailing onto her knitwear and tops, which gave another hint of kacho-ga-like juxtaposition between the natural and the handmade. Adeam continues to be a strong brand as far as technique goes.

Not for myself, not for the public, not for fashion, not for men\u2026for the image.\u201d So said torch singer, actress, and model-for-the-night Ute Lemper, paraphrasing her great muse Marlene Dietrich, before a Berlin-presented Resort collection that blended elements of Dietrich\u2019s style with that of David Bowie\u2014all via an unlikely twist of primitivism\u2014to zestily refresh the image of Max Mara. At first, the strands of inspiration that combined here seemed as disparate and unraveled as the tufted lines of fringing that trimmed pockets, hems, and legs in many of the tailored pieces. They all stemmed both from the venue city and the venue itself: Berlin\u2019s Neues Museum. Its collection of Bronze Age and prehistoric artifacts informed the apparently brutal draping on skirts; the semicircle fringe fil coup\u00e9 on trench coats and capes in mammoth brown or bloody red; the roughly textured, Lurex-shot cotton jacquard in some of the tailored pieces; the aforementioned tufting; and the mottled and beaten finish of the substantial bracelets and necklaces designed by Reema Pachachi. These touches provided a primitive bass line beneath the sophisticated duet played out above. Its performers were Dietrich, the actress and singer who pioneered an aggressively feminine interpretation of masculine tailoring, and Bowie, the singer and actor who pioneered an aggressively androgynous, shapeshifting evasion of gender norms in dress. The two did overlap once, in the \u00fcber-camp, sometimes beautiful, and often ridiculous 1978 Weimar tragicomedy Just a Gigolo. Here, Ian Griffiths of Max Mara cast them together afresh via the medium of tailoring, combining Bowie-esque, narrowly curved saddle shoulders with Dietrich-esque tuxedos, cinched coats, and capes in white, roughened brown chalk stripe, and gray. To add an extra siren-song register of drama, some of the pieces came with embellishments on the shoulder made of floral arrangements of milky white sequin inspired by the German porcelain maker Meissen, whose archive Griffiths and his team visited while preparing this collection. Unpacked on the runway as thunder rumbled ominously outside, Griffiths\u2019s portmanteau played out finely. Lemper, in the penultimate look, appeared as much the reincarnation of Dietrich as she ever has as she negotiated a fearsome staircase then strode through the raw-brick museum atrium in her Meissen-shouldered white suit. In red especially, the sophisticatedly primitive fil coup\u00e9 looked like a Bowie-ishly dramatic piece of performative stage regalia in capes, dresses, and suiting, but it was one that you could see impact-seeking Max Mara clients appreciatively incorporating into their wardrobes. All of Griffiths\u2019s primitivist gestures were tangible, but delicately enough applied to avoid a Flintstones-ish flavoring and instead add an attractive roughness to this customarily sleekest of houses. And while the collection\u2019s main weight rested on tailoring, multimaterial, paneled, and layered pliss\u00e9 skirts and saddle-shouldered epauletted blousons provided a casual and contemporary note that played to Berlin\u2019s present. Preparing for this collection, Griffiths spent some time speaking with Lemper, who herself once spent three hours on the telephone with Dietrich. The strongest lesson from that conversation, said Griffiths, was that \u201cDietrich wasn\u2019t frightened of anyone. And you tend to remember her as a dressed-up caricature of herself, but she was so much more than that.\u201d Dressing for the image doesn\u2019t necessarily tell the full story of the wearer\u2014just the one she wants to be told.

From these, Mendel drew literal and abstract inspiration for a collection that had a strong tropical vibe. (Its metaphorical soundtrack, according to Mendel, would be Cuban music.) To communicate his theme, the designer developed tinsel-y metallic jacquard with leafy patterns. He also sequined ivory organza with foliage, developed botanical prints on airy mesh, and embroidered palm fronds all over a wispy, knock-out black plunge-neck dress. Floral shapes were also dramatically worked into feather and fur evening coverups. Lovely, but expressive of a more mundane fantasy, were Mendel\u2019s \u201cprincessy\u201d dresses, which had big bows or pretty poufed sleeves (some detached).

That is exactly how my life is!\u201d The thoughts that go through Keller\u2019s mind as she posts fleeting glimpses of the Thames, Chelsea gardens, the Mall, and then the Seine, boulevards, and the Eiffel Tower whizzing by inform the basis of her Resort collections for both men and women. An effort-free merge of practicality, formality, and glamour is what she\u2019s after. \u201cI always have core staples: great T-shirts and trenches, well-cut coats and a really good pair of boots,\u201d she says, \u201cbut also elements which are a bit more frivolous and fanciful, because you always want a joyous part in the way you dress.\u201d Keller\u2019s diary triangulates between her home-office fixed points and just about anywhere in the world that events and Givenchy responsibilities take her\u2014so hers is an international view. Her travel tips are manifest in pulled-together solutions for the fast-moving scene changes which face working women: a great black poplin dress, loose-ish but chic; a beige jumpsuit; a generous trench with a black faille ribbon bisecting the back; and a series of sharp thoughts about applied tailoring. She pulls out a classic French blazer, emblazoned with doubled rows of mismatched gilt souvenir buttons. \u201cThere\u2019s a dove, a leaf, a skull, all kinds of stuff on it\u2014as if buttons have fallen off, and you\u2019ve sewn on your own,\u201d she says. Her consideration of the current popularity of tailoring among women also leads somewhere else. \u201cThere\u2019s an aspect of tailoring I\u2019ve even put into dresses, making a kind of perfect column that we haven\u2019t seen for a while,\u201d she says. Well, here we do see it, and exactly who it might be inspired by: a fitted black sleeveless midi, with two flattering rows of brass buttons graduating inwards from hip to waist, and a red stand collar not unlike a guard\u2019s uniform. Absolutely ideally appropriate for hand-shaking duties if one\u2019s partner belongs to the British military, for example? Asking pointed questions about the Duchess of Sussex is, well, out of the question. But has Waight Keller become conscious of protocol, the formalities a woman in public life must attend to? A nod and an expression which shifts to the middle distance: \u201cThere is something about that I do register, for sure,\u201d she concurs, before moving swiftly on. To evening wear. Packable \u201chybrid cocktailwear\u201d in the form of a knit and lace dress in peach and pink, and occasion pieces with frilled, pleated upstanding necklines\u2014something Hubert de Givenchy did. \u201cA lot of this descends from directly from what we did in the last couture collection,\u201d she adds. So to menswear. It\u2019s watching the guys in the Givenchy office that\u2019s mostly informed the mix of formal and sport in this offering, which now looks to be expanding. \u201cThis is how I see young guys commuting, particularly in Paris. They\u2019ll turn up with tailored jackets, so quite proper, but wear ski pants or combat pants with them.\u201d There\u2019s a representation of the slick, \u201970s-ish suit she started pushing in her first men\u2019s collection, this time in green. \u201cI love a flash suit!\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s flamboyant, but with quite a clean silhouette. We\u2019ve shown it with a black athletic T-shirt underneath\u2014that\u2019s how I see guys around here wearing things.\u201d Branding, she believes, is more important in menswear\u2014or maybe that\u2019s the legacy leftover from Riccardo Tisci\u2019s time. Givenchy is embedded in prints and jacquards, and stamped in black and white across zip closures or logo strips on shirt fronts. That commercial market still exists, but where is it going? Trust Waight Keller to keep an eagle eye on that. She has an update coming in the next few days, when Givenchy is the guest of honor at the Pitti menswear shows.

There were palm fronds, mint gimlets, and Sam Linder, standing by as cool as a cucumber. The designer was presenting the first Resort collection for his namesake label: a subversion of country-club dress codes, i.e., a trompe l\u2019oeil print of a cable-knit on a stretchy spandex top. \u201cIt\u2019s Resort, so a lot of those stereotypical ideas were floating around,\u201d he explained backstage. \u201cBut the idea was comfort and easy to wear. I\u2019m really wanting to go in that direction of catering to the instincts that people have for athleisure without making stuff that falls into that category.\u201d It\u2019s a savvy move, judging by the young crowd that had gathered. Linder\u2019s unconventional athleisure meant little running shorts cut from cream twill and blue silk, as well as an off-white tracksuit made in synthetic \u201970s Ultrasuede. \u201cFor some reason there\u2019s always a \u201970s thing that comes in,\u201d he added. \u201cI guess because I\u2019m from the \u201970s.\u201d An unmistakably \u201970s shade of lime green flitted throughout the collection, seen on a tight polo shirt with white piping and a spandex mock-neck tee and bike shorts set. Elsewhere, distinctly retro lines appeared on items like a color-blocked tennis dress with a bias-cut silk skirt below and a low square-neck tank top. One wanted Linder to dive a little deeper into his Resort world, though that will likely come with time. Consider this but a dip of the toe into the country-club pool."}, {"Designer": "Thom Browne", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "\u201cWhen quality is so important, I think you also have to counterbalance that with something that makes it seem not so serious. Fun is key.\u201d That was Thom Browne speaking from his label\u2019s Paris showroom right after showing off a dress with trompe l\u2019oeil paneling and decorative gold embroidered buttons. If quality has seemed like a given at Thom Browne\u2014precision tailoring and fastidious polish being the most outward signs\u2014the designer said today that he wants the women\u2019s collections to be as process-oriented as the menswear. The brand has always normalized a certain masculine-feminine exchange\u2014see: women\u2019s suiting and men\u2019s skirts\u2014yet this will now extend to how the clothes are made. Hence the frequency with which guy and gal appear together in these images, their looks approaching an asymptote of identicalness. Of course, it also offers an opportunity to communicate that the men have a pre-collection, too. As messages of equality extend outward across all domains, consider this Thom Browne\u2019s contribution. Whether found on the inner canvas construction of the classic slightly undersized blazers; the new lightweight wool-mohair seersucker; or the finishing touches on every fresh variation of tweed, there were subtle yet discernible signs of impressive workmanship. With the label operating under the Zegna umbrella since last August, such breadth of fabric development is surely among the many perks. But for all the investment pieces, fun was interwoven through and through, from incrustations of crustaceans to patchwork in a palette of preppy hues. And for every handsome addition\u2014the black seersucker jacket, a highlight\u2014there were several more items intended for daily dress. For anyone who loves a good oxford shirt, these ones were perfectly sized and desirably tagged with the Thom Browne tricolor. Baseball caps are being positioned as the season\u2019s key accessory, while the Mrs. Thom bag returns with softer side panels that smartly counterbalance the boxiness. Regarding the diving-dolphin motif, when Browne swam as a kid, this was the team\u2019s mascot.

And yet there are significant changes afoot at the brand. \u201cI think we\u2019ve all been asking ourselves how we can reduce our impact on the planet,\u201d Lim said, at his studio in Soho. \u201cComing to a zero carbon footprint isn\u2019t going to happen overnight, but we can find a sustainable balance.\u201d To wit, the latest collection suggested a markedly more considered approach to making clothes. Since the brand went fur-free, last year, Lim has been experimenting with sustainable fabrics and has worked with what is known as a \u201cclosed loop,\u201d eco-conscious factory in Guatemala where denim is made from upcycled fibers and any leftover waste is used as fertilizer at local coffee plantations. Cut with a cool asymmetric, calf-grazing silhouette, the resulting denim skirt suit was a polished take on a 3.1 favorite (Lim has a knack for making fashion-forward Texan tuxedos). Unconventional shirting has long been part of the designer\u2019s repertoire, and for Resort there were several fresh options made from upcycled striped men\u2019s button-downs. The handsome window-pane checks in the lineup had ecologically sound origins, too, spun from recycled polyester and water bottles at a Spanish factory that adheres to bluesign-certified practices, which in layman\u2019s terms means that no harmful chemicals were used in the production. To add to that, there were trench coats made from sustainable cotton and polished shoulder bags and backpacks fashioned from chrome-free leather (chrome is one of the most toxic ingredients in the tanning process), which the designer has been developing for the past two years. All in all, Lim\u2019s efforts reflect about 40 percent of the collection\u2014no small feat. As the fashion industry begins to reckon with the catastrophic implications of climate change, it\u2019s encouraging to see positive changes like these on the New York scene."}, {"Designer": "Tibi", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Amy Smilovic receives a lot of direct messages on Instagram, where she has followers in the form of customers, fashion students, and young designers. The students often ask her business questions, and she\u2019ll respond with a veritable lesson plan on sourcing fabrics, production minimums, hiring your team, the works. Fans of her line are more in search of styling ideas and inspiration. She\u2019s a designer who wears her own stuff from head to toe every day and takes pride in explaining the thought process behind each look. Think you can\u2019t wear a flashy sequined dress? Smilovic will show you how to \u201cchill it out\u201d with an oversized coat. Confused by the brown-and-beige trend? She\u2019ll share her tips for mixing those neutrals with a pop of turquoise. She often hears from women who feel overwhelmed by the idea of putting an outfit together at all and is passionate about helping them \u201cfind their look.\u201d That speaks to the core of what she\u2019s trying to do at Tibi: create impactful yet wearable clothes. Resort 2020 started with color, as most of her collections do, and the palette of black, taupe, electric yellow, lilac, and sage felt inherently Tibi in its off-ness. Smilovic said she chose the hues intuitively, but when her team asked her why, she couldn\u2019t put her finger on it. So she researched how colors are described to the blind and was fascinated by the results: To understand blue, they were asked to run their hands under cool water\u2014refreshing, clear, energizing! Brown\u2019s rich, natural hue was intuited by touching the earth and soil. It validated Smilovic\u2019s sense that we\u2019re mostly drawn to colors because of a feeling. What draws us to silhouettes might be a bit harder to parse. Smilovic likes to go with her instincts there too. Resort had a particular emphasis on tailoring, likely a by-product of Tibi\u2019s menswear line that debuted for Spring 2019. In lieu of the ultra-oversized blazers of seasons past, her team focused on classic construction then migrated some interior details to the exterior of jackets. Shoulder pads were placed like epaulets, for instance, and from the back a few exposed seams lent the impression of flipping the jacket inside out. A bonus: Many of those blazers and coats, like a blue-and-green checked style, came in an entirely recycled blend she found in Italy. Elsewhere, Smilovic expanded on two opposing signatures: her best-selling sequined party dresses and her industry-favorite utilitarian jumpsuits. Plenty of Tibi girls will buy them both; the common denominator is the sense of ease and comfort. Smilovic said women often tell her they wear athleisure not because they truly love it but because they don\u2019t know what else to wear or how to wear it; there\u2019s a lot of product and mixed messaging out there. If she can give them a dress or trouser that\u2019s just as comfy as a legging and has serious attitude, then her work is done."}, {"Designer": "Monse", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "You can count on Monse\u2019s Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia to surprise you with their references. From shipping labels (Resort 2019) to cycling jerseys (Fall 2019) to their own pets (Pre-Fall 2019), it seems nothing is off the table; the common denominator is that their themes are usually sort of an accident. The same was true for Resort 2020: Their boss at Oscar de la Renta, Alex Bolen, gave them a book of Victorian board games to spark some ideas for ODLR, but Kim took it to Monse\u2019s downtown studio instead, having a hunch that it would be better suited to the younger label. In addition to the old-timey look and feel of the games, she was fascinated by the odd items she found in many of them: surrealist hands, miniature soldiers, eyes, insects, and other knickknacks. She and Garcia aren\u2019t afraid of being quite literal with their Monse designs, so in addition to the usual fare\u2014playing cards, dice, jacks\u2014those symbols were integrated into prints, knit intarsias, and, more surprisingly, trompe l\u2019oeil tattoos on a sheer bodysuit. If a deck-of-cards blouse and skirt looked a bit too literal\u2014or conjured flashbacks of Alice in Wonderland\u2014that bodysuit felt fresh in its going-for-it strangeness. (Look closer, and you\u2019ll notice the heart and spade \u201ctattoos\u201d were sequined, and the Victorian \u201clover\u2019s eye\u201d had embroidered pearls around the edges, like a real brooch.) A few long-sleeved printed mesh tops had a similar look with a bit more coverage, and felt vaguely reminiscent of Jean Paul Gaultier\u2019s cult tattoo shirts from the \u201990s, which are enjoying a bit of a comeback. The body-conscious fit of those tops was arguably the real takeaway here. Kim and Garcia slimmed down their proportions across the board, trading their usual boxy blazers and wide-leg trousers for hip-hugging midi skirts, ruched silk dresses, and narrower tailoring. (Girls who are still into that sized-way-up look should consider the pieced-together unisex suits, shown here on men.) It was easy to spot the best sellers: Top of the list was a body-skimming navy dress with contrast stitching, a cut-out at the shoulder, and a floaty handkerchief hem. It was simple, yet made a statement\u2014exhibited by the number of women in the crowd wearing similar versions from Monse collections past."}, {"Designer": "Sally LaPointe", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Sally LaPointe\u2019s Resort 2020 moodboard was covered in 100-year-old photographs of women in silk pajamas. It was back in the 1920s that pajama dressing first became a trend for women, though they weren\u2019t wearing them to bed: The silky separates were an early example of \u201cborrowed from the boys\u201d style, co-opted from men\u2019s sleepwear and cleverly reinterpreted as comfortable day clothes. At a time when most women didn\u2019t wear pants in public at all, it was considered pretty gutsy to wear a drapey silk PJ pant during the day. Coco Chanel famously wore them on the beach, referring to them as \u201cyachting pants.\u201d LaPointe was instantly drawn to that backstory, and as a designer who strives to combine luxury and comfort in her collections, she saw an opportunity to put a new twist on head-to-toe silk dressing. Don\u2019t expect to see piped button-downs and kitschy prints. LaPointe\u2019s interpretations were reliably haute, comprised of double-faced satin blouses with built-in scarves, matching pants or floor-grazing skirts, and evening sets hand-embroidered with sequins. She peppered in a few belted pants in a substantial, buttery linen for a bit of contrast, as well as her now-signature cropped knits, which came in a new cashmere-silk blend (which sells at a friendlier price point sans her usual fur trim). She joked that plenty of women really will wear this stuff on the beach like Chanel and her friends in the \u201920s, but with the exception of the crochet pants and sequins, most of these looks could more than pass in an office setting. For an on-the-go woman, a satin blouse and matching pants would likely be a lot more comfortable than a pantsuit, too. LaPointe says the best feedback she gets from her customers and stores is that her clothes are truly livable; they\u2019re seriously luxe, yet easy and non-restricting. That\u2019s why she\u2019s so committed to monochrome looks, too: She was happy to report that her customers will buy a full look straight off the rack, then never think about how to style it again."}, {"Designer": "Sachin & Babi", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Relaxed day dresses in rich prints aside, Sachin & Babi\u2019s business is still very much about the evening. In that arena, they have mastered the cocktail frock\u2014embroidered or sequined, with a floppy hem or maybe a statement sleeve\u2014and so the Ahluwalias set a new challenge for Resort 2020: evening separates. Customer feedback has shown the designers that the way women dress after dark isn\u2019t always so formal, with many of their clients reaching for fun skirts, statement tops, and simple trousers that could be paired with more casual pieces. With a neon yellow one-shouldered top leading their look book, the Ahluwalias are diving into these new-ish categories headfirst. More understated dressers will find comfort in caramel vegan leather pants and a plunging faux wrap top. Long lean cape-sleeved blouses met even sleeker wide-leg trousers for what might be some of the brand\u2019s most reservedly posh pieces yet. The Ahluwalias\u2019 sense of fun was apparent in a section of \u201880s minidresses in black-and-white and in another group that was dripping in sequins.

Three years in, Khaite is already well-known throughout the industry and sincerely obsessed over by women of varying ages, occupations, and tastes around the world. That global appeal comes down to the push-pull of European and American sensibilities in Holstein\u2019s clothes\u2014Resort 2020 had a pleated tulle gown next to suede-paneled jeans, for instance\u2014but it\u2019s important to consider Khaite within the narrower context of American fashion. On the cusp of a new decade, women here seem more confused than ever about what to wear, something that\u2019s exacerbated by the tumultuous political climate and a lack of female leadership at top American brands. (New York is a good place to be a female designer at an upstart or midsize label, but as far as massive houses that really move the needle\u2026well, we can\u2019t think of many.) It\u2019s still early days for Khaite, but it isn\u2019t hard to picture it scaling to a point where it\u2019s contending with those bigger names. Holstein has been talking about redefining American style for years now (revisit her previous collections on Vogue Runway for proof). At present, Khaite is more or less defined by two poles: luxurious, hardworking daywear and unconventional eveningwear. Resort\u2019s casual contingent was partly an extension of what we saw in Khaite\u2019s Southwestern-inspired Fall 2019 show: \u201cdusty\u201d suede jackets and trousers, oversize blouses, whipstitched knits. \u201cI think I\u2019ve always gravitated to the Southwest, because I was an American who grew up in London, and I was really obsessed with American history,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt was sort of an identity crisis.\u201d Her desert references tend to be more about the spirit and landscape than, say, a literal homage to Georgia O\u2019Keeffe. There\u2019s always \u201ca bit of sharpness\u201d to balance out that warmth and softness, too (see: the sculptural leather trench). Despite their earthy origins, these clothes are meant for the city. Holstein is carving out her own niche as a red carpet designer, too, so she lent a few tweaks to Fall\u2019s airy tulle dresses and velvet evening tops. Hanging next to her sharp tailoring and floor-length coats, they looked like wisps\u2014but she was quick to point out the intricate construction inside each. They looked delicate without being flimsy, a real sweet spot. The highlight of this collection bridged the gap between those \u201cday\u201d and \u201cnight\u201d sections: a strapless, drop-waist gown in khaki poplin with a surprising bubble hem. Holstein styled it with suede lace-up ballet flats, not stilettos.

Their collections provide chic and effortless solutions to the daily conundrums of dressing at a time when there\u2019s too much fashion product, and too many niche trends, to sift through. This season, Grede and Torstensson continued their efforts to solve the sartorial problems of their customers with versatile classics. Highlights included a down jacket filled with recycled fabric, a pair of loosely fitting black leather pants, a deep green velvet minidress with balloon sleeves, and a brown patchwork skirt that brought Jane Birkin to mind.

Research trips both IRL and online have been informing their Oscar de la Renta collections. For Pre-Spring, they looked to Japan with explorations of the mostly virtual sort, save for a visit to Kim\u2019s favorite East Village udon restaurant, Raku. The curtains at Raku\u2019s Sixth Street entrance were the starting point for the dip-dyed look of a tailored pantsuit, and of a long evening dress with ancient Grecian proportions. (A summer holiday to Mykonos is clearly also on their minds.) The Japanese references were handled subtly; they might not even register with customers. That\u2019s partly because Kim and Garcia were interested in the moment when the country opened to Europe. Navy tailoring trimmed in gold bullion was apparently designed in the image of a mid-19th century Meiji emperor who adopted Western military attire, while the collection\u2019s kimono evening coat and jacket were softly structured where authentic versions would have more sculptural forms. Japan\u2019s make-do-and-mend tradition of wabi-sabi was interpreted obliquely on a patchwork pantsuit and more explicitly on a strapless corseted party dress that looked constructed from scraps of quilted indigo. That dress had a certain substantiality. As a rule, this duo prefers a more relaxed ease, which plays into their preoccupation with travel and the peripatetic lifestyles of their customers. Garcia was particularly taken with an ivory goddess dress, ephemeral in its aspect save for the gold chains that crisscrossed its bare back."}, {"Designer": "Altuzarra", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Joseph Altuzarra\u2019s range spans earthy sensuality and urban sophistication. Taking cues from Robert Altman\u2019s 1977 classic 3 Women, the designer emphasized the former in his new Resort collection, without sacrificing any of his signature polish. The waist of a Lurex striped caftan, one of the lineup\u2019s highlights, was gathered with tumbled tiger\u2019s eye and lapis stones strung on leather cord, and the handkerchief hem dresses that have proven so popular for him in the past were printed with mandalas made from flowers. Much of the action in 3 Women takes place at a desert health spa, but the mandalas and crystals feel distinctly of this moment\u2014attuned to our earth-in-the-balance fixations on wellness and witchy mysticism. The ecological predicament we find ourselves in has encouraged sensitive designers to reconsider their production methods. Altuzarra has taken his first steps in this direction, creating a pair of dresses\u2014one midi-length, the other maxi\u2014patchworked from chevron stripes of deadstock fabrics and materials from his own previous collections. They were utterly winning\u2014statement-making but easy, in the manner of his best work\u2014so it was good to hear that he\u2019s keeping sustainability initiatives top of mind for Spring 2020. The clever developments on the accessories front included a lace-up suede espadrille boot lined in shearling. Striking a modern note amidst the more traditional stacked heel boots and pumps, it would add a breezy charm to one of his handkerchief hem dresses. He also iterated on his successful espadrille soled tote; the new clog bag has a sturdy but lightweight wood bottom."}, {"Designer": "Tanya Taylor", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "For a couple of years now, the story at Tanya Taylor has been about slimming down the silhouettes and dialing back the ruffles and extras. In that regard, Resort 2020 might be her sleekest yet: Aside from the floaty sleeves on a jacquard midi dress, there was nary a flounce in sight. That doesn\u2019t mean things are getting boring, of course. Taylor balanced those new, easier shapes with extra-punchy colors, from \u201980s-ish abstract leopard spots to a nearly neon pink plaid coat. She\u2019s finding that, refreshingly, her customers aren\u2019t shy about color; they just want it on leaner, more comfortable silhouettes. It\u2019s easy to picture working women in particular wanting Taylor\u2019s new printed jersey dresses\u2014so soft and drapey, they felt like pajamas\u2014and A-line striped knit frocks. We spend most of our days sitting at a desk or running to and from meetings; who can abide a fussy dress or a strict pencil skirt? Taylor\u2019s greatest wish is that strong, self-possessed women will find themselves in her clothes, so her mood board tends to be pinned with specific icons: Last season, it was Lauren Bacall; Resort\u2019s muse was Zadie Smith. The author has a few things in common with Taylor\u2014namely a love of mixed prints and pink suits\u2014but the designer was more inspired by the way Smith uses clothing to transmit her point of view. Her signature look is \u201cstrong and direct,\u201d never girly or delicate, a balance Taylor hoped to capture in her clean tailoring and unapologetic palette. She wants her customers to be able to get dressed easily and still look instantly polished and unintimidated (though it will take a certain fearlessness to try that Day-Glo pink plaid).

Edgy prettiness is something she has always brought to her eponymous label, via clothes that are a little tough, but with a touch of girly woven into the seams. This season, Webb went full force with this idea, presenting a lineup filled with juxtaposing angles that somehow fit together quite seamlessly. A cheery, lady-friendly floral wrap dress filled one niche, while her familiar paperbag pants in black leather fulfilled the tomboy quota. A black and white tie-dyed T-shirt printed with a bull skull motif likewise belonged to this latter category, but here her rock \u2019n\u2019 roll aesthetic went a bit too far.

They weren\u2019t dressed in the resortwear and big sunglasses you often see in Aarons\u2019s photographs, though; Rose\u2019s interpretation of his \u201960s heyday was more about a return to certain silhouettes\u2014like drop-waisted dresses and voluminous capes\u2014and casual-chic daywear, seen in monochromatic crepe separates with charming rickrack trims. The rich, saturated palette felt Aarons-esque: cherry red, hibiscus, tangerine, periwinkle, and stark black and white. Rose mixed and color-blocked those shades in ways that felt new, particularly when it came to her fanciest evening pieces, like a raw-edged satin dress in Valentine\u2019s Day colors.

That is, in essence, what Rag & Bone has always been about\u2014Anglomania-meets-Americana\u2014but against 2019\u2019s truly bizarre political backdrop, it reads especially poignantly this season. In his showroom in the Meatpacking District, Wainwright was especially proud to discuss the British craftsmanship built into this collection. Blazers were made by Linton Tweeds, an over-100-year-old manufacturer that produced tweeds for Coco Chanel. Rag & Bone\u2019s come with a flicker of black Lurex\u2014call it a New Yorker sparkle. Elsewhere, Abraham Moon, another legendary English mill most famous for clothing James Bond on screen, provided fabrics for a sleek women\u2019s tuxedo. To counter all this tradition, Wainwright continued to riff on his workwear and military obsessions, with ripstop nylon boilersuits and cargo pants, and an injection of neon green silk slips. Zebra print, an evolution of last season\u2019s leopard spots, appeared on dresses, knitwear, shoes, and skirts.

Such a huge, irreplaceable loss was obviously deeply felt, yet the transition has been seamlessly secured by Silvia Venturini Fendi, who has worked alongside Lagerfeld all her life. Her clever drive was already perceptible in the creative input she gave for the season, treating the design teams to a private viewing of John Cassavetes\u2019s \u201980s thriller Gloria, starring his then-wife Gena Rowlands. The collection\u2019s rather intriguing starting point was Rowlands\u2019s fearless, sexy character, a former call girl and mobster\u2019s lover who redeems herself by helping a kid escape death at the hands of the mafia. In the movie, Rowlands\u2019s wardrobe was designed by the French couturier Emanuel Ungaro, who gave Gloria a stylish yet provocative look, classy but seductive. The same vibe was highlighted in a daywear offer where the experimental bent inherent to Fendi\u2019s repertoire was smoothed in favor of a softer and more fluid approach, without detracting from the eccentric play between masculine and feminine, and construction and looser shapes, which are other recurring Fendi themes. What could\u2019ve resulted in a passing reference to the bourgeois look in favor today was given a jolt of edgy discipline and a haute sensuality. This was expressed in a series of soft tailored suits with sharp-cut blazers paired with matching trapeze midi skirts that were deceitfully demure, the sexy high slits on the sides revealing bare legs and high-heeled leather boots. As an homage to Rowlands\u2019s seductive style, a black suit with a fitted blazer and a pleated midi skirt in silk jacquard was named \u201cGloria\u201d: It was the template for a few variations on the theme, the most glamorous being a version in warm brown shaved mink with handmade pierced geometric motifs. Stamped patent leather in flame red added a frisson of audacity to a classic trenchcoat, and the sensuality of soft black leather was in evidence on an elongated midi dress with a feminine bow at the back. Leather was also the fabric of choice for \u201980s-inspired high-waisted, wide-legs trousers, worn with chic silk blouses or with a sporty mink blouson tucked in. The logo was played subtly but consistently throughout the collection: the famous Karligraphy theme, together with the double FF and the Pequin (the signature black-and-brown stripes), were printed in discreet, micro versions on fluid silk-twill pajama suits, or rendered as piping along slit skirts or else as colorful intarsia work on a luxurious mink wrap coat."}, {"Designer": "Emilio Pucci", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The Emilio Pucci spirit is characterized by easy sophistication, slightly blas\u00e9 and nonchalant; a summer-loving flair for holidays on private yachts and secluded beaches, for alfresco lunches in elegant seaside villas. For Resort, the label\u2019s creative team, which has been designing the collection for a few seasons now, tapped into this notion of luxurious wanderlust. This season the globetrotting Pucci woman opted for a trip to Polynesia, as seen through the saturated colors and exotic atmospheres of Paul Gauguin\u2019s paintings, which were translated into rich, abstract prints. The place\u2019s lush vegetation and its bold-patterned textiles were the compelling visual backbone of the collection. The offer, which looked edited and slightly condensed compared to previous proposals, was built around versatile pieces that transition from day to night. A printed dress in silk jersey made famous by Marilyn Monroe was reimagined as a long-sleeve T-shirt minidress, embellished with sequined fringes conveying a liquid, shimmering feel. It\u2019d look good paired with denim pants for day, or with bare legs and heels for a night out. Outerwear in solid colors (shorts-suits with elongated blazers, and cape coats and trench coats in shades of sand white, deep-sea blue, and coral) was introduced to rhythmically break the bold intensity of the printed surfaces of short chiffon dresses and billowing caftans, silk twill pajama suits, and full-circle skirts paired with matching tops. The slim, neat silhouette was counterbalanced by a pleated tulle skirt, decorated with colorful printed silk-twill ribbons and paired with a T-shirt knitted in thin lurex, or by a long evening dress in silver fil coup\u00e9, ruched on the sides and printed in delicate pastel hues. Beachwear was a consistent proposal, as it should be at a label with a flair for upscale leisure \u00e0 la Slim Aarons. Flattering one-piece swimsuits and tiny bikinis came printed and three-dimensionally embellished, worn under glamorous caftans in see-through lace or with pareo-inspired wrapped skirts. Pucci\u2019s strong points were reworked in a more streamlined, concise way here. It could be a positive step for the label\u2019s future.

For this collection Clayton found for inspiration a marvelous but distinctly non-monochrome image of Ettedgui standing alongside Margaret Howell and two others in a photograph that surely dates from the 1980s but that also emanated a strong Annie Hall vibe: a symphony of beiges played in creased linen and wheaty knits.

This season team Preen, Thornton and Thea Bregazzi, appropriated that appropriation 150 years or so after the fact and the results were similarly energizing. According to the designers none of the pieces here were repeats of or variations on staples of past seasons. A full-armed, tree bark pleated dress in cherrywood brown; a \u201cdragon skin\u201d pattern (woodblock-print-inspired) silk viscose dress with a kimono edged collar in vinyl and a square-shouldered breastplate panel; and sakura-meets-Monet floral relief dresses in silk devor\u00e9 complemented by paint-stroke arcs of pastel marabou were all fresh-feeling Preen expressions. Cascade-hemmed dresses with panels at the chest and arms edged in ruffle were cleverly mish-mashed blends of the Japanese source material and the pretty prissiness of Victoriana. A golden brown serpent-print short dress played full sleeve against smocked wrist and light layers at the hem against a heavier vinyl panel. A trench coat in slightly off combinations of beige and yellow, plus a plucked chenille sweater in distressed florals added an undertow of sweet grunginess. Double-faced sequined dresses that changed color as you ran a hand along them left the wearer to paint their own pattern. Back in 1997 or so it was an order from a Japanese agency, Agosto, that first made Thornton and Bregazzi suspect their business might be destined for bigger things than the Portobello market stall from which they were still operating. A couple of decades on, they head a well-staffed studio not far from that stall, from which they continue to produce wonderfully distinct womenswear for a committed global audience of Preen-ophiles.

Because it was the world of the past, because it was a world that no longer exists.\u201d Alessandro Michele quoted the historian Paul Veyne in his original French on a spray-painted bed sheet hung from the entryway of the Musei Capitolini venue where his Gucci Resort show was held tonight. It was a fitting quote for a collection presented in what\u2019s considered the first museum in the world; Rome\u2019s Musei Capitolini was conceived by Michelangelo in 1471 and opened to the public in 1734. Inside, Michele\u2019s gawky beauties walked among ancient statues in near darkness, illuminated only by torches placed on guests\u2019 seats. So far, so typical for Gucci\u2019s creative director, who riffles through the decades\u2014centuries, even\u2014like other designers swiping through Instagram. This show marked a turning point for Michele, who pivoted from poetry and theory\u2014he\u2019s quoted everyone from William Blake to Donna Haraway\u2014to politics. Midway through the show, a purple jacquard pantsuit came down the runway; across the back, splashed in big block letters were the words: My Body, My Choice. A few looks later, an ivory dress appeared with its midsection embroidered in the shape of a uterus; in place of ovaries there were blooming pink flowers. Elsewhere in the show, the date 22.05.1978, the day the Italian law protecting legal abortion took effect, decorated the mini capelet that accessorized a pajama top and matching skirt. Still other models wore tattooed \u201cscarves\u201d across their mouths, as if silenced, or muzzled. At the press conference after the show, Michele explained himself: \u201cWomen have to be respected\u2026they should be free to choose what they want.\u201d He said he designed the collection, some of which was completed in the last 24 hours, as a reaction to \u201crecent news.\u201d Restrictive abortion bans designed to challenge and eventually reverse Roe v. Wade at the Supreme Court level were proposed in Alabama, Missouri, Ohio, and Georgia earlier this month. Michele, and by extension Gucci, are taking a clear stance against reproductive injustice here. It\u2019s not the first time that the brand has endorsed activism; a year ago, Gucci donated $500,000 to March for Our Lives, a gun violence prevention organization. But it is the first time Michele has made his position so explicit. To be sure, there was as much at play here as ever. Michele made lavish reference to historical dress, draping a toga over a plaid suit and dressing male and female models in the familiar red and un-dyed white wool of Roman army uniforms. \u201cIt was important to organize this show in Rome,\u201d he said, \u201cto pay tribute, to glorify this place of freedom.\u201d Also: Mickey Mouse reared his big-eared head on all manner of pieces, and there were logo\u2019d guitar cases to beat the band. Michele\u2019s Gucci speaks to a large, diverse audience, but this collection will resonate loudest with those who understand just how much is at stake in the fight for women\u2019s reproductive rights. His sensitivity to the issue is bound to influence designers and brands, just as his eclectic magpie aesthetic and embrace of individual style has reverberated down through the seasons since his appointment at Gucci."}, {"Designer": "Just Cavalli", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Roberto Cavalli is a label foundering at extremely low tide. Without a creative director, apparently up for sale, in urgent need of a cash injection, and no hot property\u2014despite the sterling recent work of Paul Surridge\u2014this is a brand whose heritage story has yet to be rebooted in a way that drives customers wild. It is always darkest before the dawn. This week at the studios of Just Cavalli licensee Staff International there seemed a glimmer of potential renewal, should whoever ends up responsible for Cavalli choose to explore it. Here, the Cavalli codes are being reinterpreted by two young, below-the-line designers. Its womenswear designer is a woman, aged 26, who has been with the sub-label for three years. Its menswear designer is a man, aged 30, who started out working under Surridge two years ago before taking on responsibility for Just.

While phlegmatic about the current malaise afflicting the brand, both are enthusiastic about and committed to their project to deconstruct and reframe the sexy-sexy, subtle as a slap in the face, original codes of Roberto Cavalli for an audience of their contemporaries. In womenswear the designer is exploring alternatives to Cavalli\u2019s binary of hemlines\u2014risky risqu\u00e9 micros or red carpet maxis\u2014and introducing light-of-touch extensions to the Cavalli aesthetic rendered in 2019-relevant form. These include printed parkas with curled-snake hardware, a metallic croc-embossed gabardine jacket and pant, a dynamic rendering of the Eva jacket with a slim pant and crop top, and dungarees in a finely made distressed denim jacquard. Across the gender divide there were more dungarees (the connecting membrane between Resort and menswear this season was music festivals) as well as slyly brash tracksuits and some sheer shirting for buffed boys to strut in. Who knows what will happen to Cavalli in the next few months, or who will be left to make decisions on its behalf. However giving two young Italians who already understand the brand a few seasons of freedom to recast Cavalli in a way that speaks to them and theirs\u2014and to reject the humorless commercial considerations that have so led this brand to the lowest of ebbs\u2014might be worth considering."}, {"Designer": "Giorgio Armani", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Giorgio Armani\u2019s love affair with Japan goes way back, to when he first came to the country as a young designer in 1982. The appreciation has always been mutual. Armani is a superstar in Japan; people stop him in the streets, asking for autographs and selfies. \u201cThe Japanese are more Armani than Armani,\u201d the designer joked. His business in the country is remarkably solid, with 90 points of sale, 34 of which are in Tokyo. In 2007, he opened the majestic Armani/Ginza Tower here. Its sleek glass fa\u00e7ade and marble interiors were first designed by the Italian architects Massimiliano Fuksas and Doriana Mandrelli Fuksas; last year, it underwent a renovation masterminded by the designer himself in collaboration with his team of architects. Two additional Armani Casa floors were added and the ready-to-wear and accessories floors were given makeovers. The shimmering building was reopened on Thursday with a cocktail reception and a dinner in the revamped rooftop restaurant. To celebrate the reopening, Armani decided to present his Resort 2020 collection in Tokyo. It was a first for the designer who has so far shunned the current trend of mega-brands staging spectacular productions in far-flung locations. \u201cI do not agree with this,\u201d he said at a press conference before the show. \u201cAfter all, Resort collections are mainly commercial; they have to be salable and appeal to buyers.\u201d Armani speaks his mind and does things his own way. Case in point was the location he chose for the show: Tokyo\u2019s National Museum, which houses one of the most precious and rare collections of Japanese and Asian art. The show was a glamorous affair \u00e0 la Armani: no pyrotechnics, but a first-rate attendance of Japanese and international celebrities. Uma Thurman was glowing in the front row, together with Japanese archi-star Tadao Ando, a longtime collaborator of the designer. A few days ago, Leonardo DiCaprio looked dashing in an Armani tuxedo at the Cannes Film Festival. Movie stars flock to the label, which was among the first to acknowledge the brand-building power of Hollywood\u2019s mega-stars. The Resort collection focused on a daywear offer built around Armani\u2019s soft tailoring repertoire. Fluidity was paramount, as was a sense of ease, which he cultivated with a balanced approach between purity of lines and a feminine, slightly eccentric flair for decoration. \u201cI think that the secret of my success is to brush against provocation and then somehow back down, restoring harmony and aesthetic composure,\u201d he explained. The Armani pantsuit was proposed in multiple updated variations, spanning the gamut from classic three-pieces (the jackets cut malleable and soft and paired with tapered pants) to elongated, buttonless, and belted blazers, with strong yet well-proportioned shoulders, worn with skinny velvet trousers. The masculine inspiration is always a distinctive trait chez Armani, yet it was smoothed and relaxed. Even when suspenders made a puzzling appearance, they felt like a playful, nonchalant gesture. The same light spirit infused a tortoise-inspired abstract print, replacing more obvious animalier motifs; it graced a straight-cut pantsuit as well as a patent-leather trapeze caban, cinched at the waist by a knotted leather belt. The transition to eveningwear was underlined by a flowing color palette. From grays and coffee-brown tones, the collection shifted into pale aqua, Yves Klein blue, turquoise, coral, and vivid lacquer red. Shapes became gently bodycon and elongated. A lean midnight-blue silk tulle tunic worn over stretchy silk leggings shimmered with sequined embroideries, and feminine dresses in layered red chiffon were embellished with whimsical flower motifs. The menswear followed the same soft-tailoring template, only with a more sporty approach, which cut the formality and added a modern vibe. Casual knit jackets and peacoats alternated with more elegant double-breasted suits. Leather looked smooth and comfortably sensual, as did the use of silk velvet for an updated alternative to the evening suit. Featuring a sleek, collarless jacket, worn cinched at the waist with a logo belt, it looked cool, in the classy Armani way."}, {"Designer": "3x1", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "As a denim designer, few endorsements are as effective as Bella Hadid wearing your jeans\u2014and not just wearing them, but liking them so much that she rewears them on the regular.

The jean became so popular with Hadid\u2019s fans and 3x1 shoppers that Morrison reissued and tweaked it a few times, and for Resort 2020, he pushed the concept further by extending the slit nearly to the knee. A slit is an admittedly low-tech flourish, but it adds something a bit gestural to your look; when you walk, it reveals a flash of leg and your shoes, livening up even the simplest jeans-and-T-shirt combo. Morrison applied the same thinking to Resort\u2019s standout skirt: an indigo midi with double slits up the thighs. (Bonus: It should be a lot easier to wear than the strict, narrow skirts we\u2019ve been seeing elsewhere.) Another skirt in bleached-out denim had a deep slash in the front, and he introduced a cute button-front denim minidress.

Getaway clothes have often formed the basis of Resort collections because they arrive in stores so close to the winter holidays. Piccioli was more interested in aligning elegance and the everyday. \u201cPre-collections have to be about a wardrobe,\u201d he elaborated. The opening look paints a compelling picture of his vision: a sweeping cape, silk shirtdress, suede boots, and wide-brimmed hat without a single superfluous embellishment or stitch, and all in complementary shades of purple. Piccioli has mastered the art of doing more with less. A blouse in dark red taffeta and a long skirt in plum taffeta, both couture-ish in their proportions, were just as good at marrying the real with an alluring sense of grandeur. It was that juxtaposition that animated the collection\u2019s most novel looks, like a black evening suit with a cape-like jacket embroidered in sequins and ostrich plumes and bermuda shorts in place of trousers, or a streamlined, long black shirtdress whose multicolor stripes were formed by tiny embroideries of crystals and feathers. Piccioli is lucky to have at his fingertips decades worth of pictures of archival Valentino Garavani looks. One famous 1968 photo of Lauren Hutton inspired a naively and lively printed day dress, and another of Veruschka circa the late \u201970s was the template for an apricot satin pajama set voluptuously trimmed in feather tassels.

In their case, simplicity rhymes more with finesse than with plainness. Having an appreciation for craft and the sophistication that goes into the minute details they favor, their style is tinged with an elevated folksy attitude. For Resort, they injected a touch of playfulness into the mix, to ease their sometimes too rigorous m.o.: \u201cThe silhouette is very elongated, very lean,\u201d said Luke. \u201cIt follows the body line, but then it breaks with a playful gesture, like tying something around the waist, be it a belt, a sweater, or a leather waist bag. Trying to convey a sense of lightness and movement.\u201d Cases in point were a striped poplin shirtdress with a matching masculine shirt casually tied around the waist, and an obi-inspired belt draped around a white ottoman cotton canvas chemise, worn over a handmade raffia-crocheted skirt. Mitigating further the elegant severity inherent to the designers\u2019 approach, oversize proportions were reduced and softened, as in a white apron-sundress tightly smocked, its hem ending in a crisp, graceful flounce. Or else shoulders were cut rounded and feminine, as in a black cotton trapeze blouse paired with a matching ankle-grazing asymmetrical skirt; or again, in a white linen A-line midi dress, where the shoulder line had a neat lightness, precise and softly sculptural. Even tailoring, one of the brand\u2019s strong points, was rendered with a softer edge. \u201cWe like tailoring because it\u2019s handmade,\u201d said Luke. \u201cIt\u2019s not an industrial product. For us, elegance comes down to an appreciation for the care and refinement that goes into things well made.\u201d This is why craft and handwork give their collections a modern folksy feel. Tie-dye Shibori techniques were used as decorative elements on a loose shirt-skirt ensemble, like red abstract poppies blooming on a tobacco raw-silk-canvas field. Elsewhere, white tie-dye motifs lit up an indigo blue cotton blouse. Along the same lines, flowery raffia crochet patches were stitched on a long black pliss\u00e9 skirt with crisp striped inserts. Worn with a tailored blazer and a white sculpted blouse in ottoman cotton canvas, it looked polished and cool. Underlining the imaginative feel, looks were completed with playful accessories: Japanese-inspired chunky wooden platforms with braided laces; flat sandals trailing raffia fringed tassels; flower-shaped sculptural earrings; and pearl pendants. Extra-large straw shopping bags evoked a crescent moon, while a bohemian fringy shoulder bag concealed a rigid boxy purse on the inside. They revealed a poetic, quirky side of the designers\u2019 aesthetic. Breaking free from control can open up clever new perspectives."}, {"Designer": "Dsquared2", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "For Resort, Dean and Dan Caten traded their typical black-leather-tough-cookie look for a more bohemian lady-of-the-canyon vibe, all flowery chiffons and billowy tiered dresses. Why the change? \u201cWe went to Ibiza,\u201d they said. For these fun-loving designers, an island vacation is inspiration enough. But the flowers-in-your-hair factor was turned down by the harder edge they tend to favor. Flowy frocks notwithstanding, do not expect much swooning romance here. \u201cIt\u2019s bohemian biker,\u201d they elaborated. Think of the raw charm of Peter Fonda in Easy Rider, or the glammed-up \u201970s look of Charlie\u2019s Angels, and you\u2019ve got the picture. A riot of flowery prints graced long chiffon dresses with full sleeves and ruches galore. The same motifs and same vintage feel were translated into shorter-than-short minidresses and flimsy flounced blouses, which amped up the sexy factor when paired with micro-shorts in soft denim or high-waisted flared jeans. A crafty touch is mandatory when referencing the \u201970s. Crocheted and fringed ponchos worn sensually off the shoulders and hand-knit minidresses and tops ticked all the right boxes, as did the hippyish fitted jackets in soft tan suede. The Catens know how to mix practicality and glamour; while a sporty feel wasn\u2019t overtly addressed for Resort, they offered versions of classic utilitarian outerwear in line with their romantic-sexy take. A cotton canvas field jacket was layered on its outside with patches of floral cotton voile; the same graceful motif was repeated on the masculine version of the item. This season, guys\u2019 looks received the same retro-tinged treatment as those of the girls, together with an extra dose of romance. Jeans were soft, almost languid in their loose, easygoing cut, decorated with contrasting inserts, and high waisted. Denim jackets and washed cotton canvas field jackets had leather intarsia mixed with floral patches for a gentle, nonchalant feel, highlighted also by the softness of unlined suede jackets. Easy Rider never looked so sweet."}, {"Designer": "Camilla and Marc", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Futurism, technological discourse, the golden ratio. These terms sound like they were ripped from the pages of a STEM research book. In fact, they\u2019re words used by Marc Freeman and Camilla Freeman-Topper to define and describe their last three ready-to-wear collections. For Resort 2020, the siblings behind Camilla and Marc riffed on the dichotomies found in nature and humanity. \u201cOrder and disorder, calm and chaos,\u201d they wrote in their collection notes. As theoretical as that sounds, the designers\u2019 point of view is simply defined; it\u2019s all in the tailoring. Importantly, the construction, silhouettes, and fabrications of their Camilla and Marc lineups are becoming more elevated. This season there were beautiful strapless dresses in black and tan patent leather finished with voluminous skirts. A similarly cut dress in a bright yellow hue detailed with visible seams at the bust was just as desirable. Fluid leather trousers and matching button-down tops were versatile standouts, as were belted cotton dresses in white and an asymmetrical stripe. The collection\u2019s clean, sharp cuts did more to impress than the hot pink metallic top with exaggerated belle sleeves or the digital prints in bright blues and marigolds. The Camilla and Marc aesthetic will always have a little edge to it, and perhaps some deeper meaning too. But where these designers are excelling right now is with the notion that sometimes in life a well-constructed garment is all you really need to find balance."}, {"Designer": "Zac Posen", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "In 2017, Lindsey Wixson announced she was leaving the modeling business. A foot injury meant her catwalking days were behind her, but her retirement has proven short-lived. In flats and low heels, she posed for Zac Posen\u2019s new Resort collection, shot by Vanina Sorrenti. Not only that, Wixson also styled the shoot, picking the pieces she liked best from Posen\u2019s extensive lineup. \u201cIt\u2019s important to nurture aspiring talent,\u201d the designer said, adding that he appreciated Wixson\u2019s fresh perspective. \u201cShe put together separates and chose parts of the collection that I don\u2019t regularly shoot, that I consider more \u2018commercial,\u2019 \u201d he explained. The resulting lookbook has a freer, more whimsical aspect than usual. It\u2019s evocative of a woman\u2019s closet, with pieces chosen on impulse rather than strategically to tell a seasonal story. Wixson\u2019s eclectic choices point up Posen\u2019s broad range. There\u2019s tailoring in a vaguely 1940s vein, strong-shouldered and full-legged. There are cotton frocks in crisp white and flirty Liberty florals. There are even interesting handknit sweaters, with drop shoulders shot through with Lurex. As diverse as his offering is, Posen\u2019s heart is in eveningwear. It was well on display at the Met Gala, where Jourdan Dunn and Nina Dobrev modeled innovative 3-D printed dresses made in collaboration with GE, like moving sculptures. Here, he focused on softer pieces, though they hardly lacked his signature drama. Wixson played up that aspect on the collection\u2019s two standouts. The first was a Watteau-back cape gown in midnight ombr\u00e9 silk jacquard, both grand and easy at once; the second: a stricter, but still flamboyant evening coat in luscious peony pink silk moir\u00e9."}, {"Designer": "Burberry", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The first thing that hits you about this Burberry collection is its vastness. In the Horseferry Road Burberry HQ in London, its display extends over two floors of showroom and an extra sunken area spotlighting eveningwear. It runs through nearly every shade of personality imaginable, female and male, from sexy sophisticates in slinky, drapey caramel trenches to logo-crazed hypebeasts. You cannot enter this domain without being aware of Riccardo Tisci\u2019s drive for Burberry to be all things to all people\u2014a spectrum of demographics he\u2019s represented here, unconventionally for a brand lookbook, in a series of different setups. Immersion amongst so many rails and so many \u201cdrops\u201d of clothing and accessories could threaten to be overwhelming, but credit to Tisci, the throughline is a more detailed focus on the design he\u2019s always been good at: glamour on the one hand, streetwear on the other. Classic British tropes of horse blankets, ponchos, trenchcoats, and military trouser suits are given a luxurious spin for grown-ups\u2014the type of women who definitely live in heels (maybe the new \u201cflared\u201d ones) rather than English country wellies. It\u2019s an advance on the bourgeois looks Tisci first allocated to the ladylike segment of the collection\u2014pulled-together but more relaxed, less reliant on vintage quotes, with an interesting recurring \u201cscarf-line\u201d detail giving drape and fluttering volume to sleeves on blouses and dresses. For evening, there are elegant, impeccable tuxedos\u2014one topped with a clever device of a bolero with sleeves made from fringed cashmere scarves\u2014and the kind of sexy skin-baring black dresses Tisci excels at. Younger women, too, are given a plethora of dressing-up and going-out choices\u2014sparkly chain mail, fringe, blinged-out crystal-studded TB logo bags. In menswear, Tisci is definitely aiming for the fashion-conscious urban scenario he knows so well; after all, he was the one who practically invented the luxury end of streetwear in the time he was at Givenchy. Followers will recognize the Tisci-isms in the printed shorts and tracksuits and the oversize puffer silhouettes, now accessorized with various graphics, some of which spell out the Burberry headquarters\u2019 address on cross-body bags on chains. Whether it\u2019s that end of the collection\u2014or the sharp, pared-back suiting with which Burberry dominates male red-carpet dressing\u2014it\u2019s all about filling stores with go-to wardrobe staples and hits of novelty. The all-over graffiti looks were a representation of exactly that retail-consciousness. After Tisci installed a wall for people to scribble on in the Burberry Bond Street store, he had the result turned into prints; a kind of interactive customer feedback loop."}, {"Designer": "Alberta Ferretti", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Alberta Ferretti decamped to a posh location on the French Riviera to present her Resort collection; her show was the jewel of the crown of Monte-Carlo Fashion Week, now in its seventh edition under the High Patronage of HSH Princess Charlene of Monaco. Sustainability, being the hot topic du jour, was this season\u2019s focus on the Mon\u00e9gasque catwalks. \u201cGreen is the New Glam\u201d was MCFW\u2019s headline, and an Ethical and Sustainable Award was bestowed upon the Italian designer, acknowledging her new engagement on issues like limiting waste in fashion, the use of eco-friendly materials, respect for the planet, and responsible consumption. Ferretti was elated by the recognition: \u201cI\u2019m very proud,\u201d she enthused. \u201cFashion\u2019s communication power is such that it can convey this message to millions of people, raising awareness, and fostering a responsible behavior. But I know that it\u2019s a huge problem, which certainly cannot be solved in just one season.\u201d But doing even a little something can make a difference. For Resort, most of her cashmere was upcycled, and all of the cotton was certified as sustainably produced. Lately, Ferretti has focused her collections around daywear, trying to find a balance between the delicate feel for romance expressed in her signature evening dresses and the sense of practical, no-nonsense but stylish purpose that an everyday wardrobe needs. While successful at retail, the reviews of her collections have lately been mixed. \u201cMy take on daywear is sophisticated and eccentric,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has to convey personality, uniqueness, character. Women are no longer afraid to dare.\u201d Without detracting from any uniqueness of expression, the daring factor was rather pared down for Resort; some styling excesses that muddled her Fall message were wisely smoothed. Ferretti kept things simple but dynamic: Easy wardrobe pieces such as slim-fitted pants, pencil skirts, culottes, and minidresses were offered in soft, sensual suede in classy tones of navy blue and beige, studded with metallic eyelets. Elsewhere there were pops of turquoise or fire red, as in a glossy-leather combo of high-waisted pants and a masculine shirt. Denim was washed, malleable, and pastel-hued; tailoring was rendered in fluid, feminine variations. A white trench was proposed either elongated as a duster or sharply abbreviated as a minidress to show bare legs. Day dresses were delightfully unfussy yet quite feminine, skirting the fine line between practicality and sensuality. But however convincing her daywear proposal, Ferretti was at her best when working on eveningwear. For the finale, she concocted a series of impalpable long numbers in dreamy shades of aqua, ocean blue, turquoise, and cerulean. Tiered, ruffled, and sprinkled with feathers and shining with scales of mother of pearl, they\u2019d turn any woman into a mermaid."}, {"Designer": "Tory Burch", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "A couple years ago, Tory Burch name-checked The Philadelphia Story as the season\u2019s reference point, specifically its outspoken lead character played by Katharine Hepburn. The star\u2019s elegant wardrobe influenced the Fall 2017 collection here and there, but as a born-and-raised Pennsylvanian, the film\u2019s setting had a personal resonance for Burch. For Resort 2020, she was thinking about Pennsylvania again, but this time she drew more directly from her own memories on the family farm. There were touches of quilting, for instance, a nod to Pennsylvania Dutch bedding; lively avian prints inspired by the colorful birds that lived on the farm; and wildflower embroideries lifted from the surrounding flora and fauna. More personal were the items inspired by her father\u2019s \u201970s wardrobe (a common touchpoint for Burch): plaid sherpas, sleek leather cargo jackets, a \u201ctweed\u201d printed suit. As for the vivid palette\u2014those quilted pieces came in color-blocked hot pink, green, and yellow, for instance\u2014Burch said they were a nod to the cartoons she remembers watching on TV. \u201cIt\u2019s a little psychedelic,\u201d she added, pointing out the swirling florals of a cloud-like quilted jacket and the kaleidoscopic print of a pleated midi skirt. For all of that vibrancy, she added that keeping things \u201cquite minimal\u201d is still top of mind. She picked up a sleek ivory dress with ruched, puffed-up sleeves and dangling ties; fans of her recent Fall 2019 show will recognize it as a cousin to the black-and-turquoise version she showed on the runway. This one came with an eclectic new touch: a few giant technicolor birds printed throughout. Were they herons? Ibises? Possibly neither. For Burch\u2019s purposes, though, they helped sum up this collection: a juxtaposition of nature, her childhood, and that signature TB exuberance. She\u2019s calling it \u201crustic, yet refined,\u201d a vibe many of her peers are going for, too\u2014but it\u2019s unlikely that their collections will feel quite this personal."}, {"Designer": "Louis Vuitton", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The historic TWA Flight Center, designed by Eero Saarinen in 1962, looks like a UFO grounded amid the 747s of JFK airport. A vintage newsreel, which Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re recently posted on Instagram, described it as \u201ca modern marvel that will impress generations to come.\u201d The terminal closed almost 20 years ago, but it still looms large in the public imagination. The producers of last year\u2019s heist movie Ocean\u2019s 8 staged a runway show in its sweeping lobby, and before that, it made an appearance in Steven Spielberg\u2019s Catch Me If You Can. Next week, after a multiyear renovation, it will reopen as a hotel, complete with 500-plus rooms and an infinity pool. The Louis Vuitton Resort show that Ghesqui\u00e8re staged tonight was its unofficial coming-out party. Air travel has lost most of its luster since the heyday of Trans World Airlines (drive time to JFK this evening was 90 minutes, speaking of). Though this outing nodded to the 1960s, with its stewardess-short dresses and accessories that lifted inspiration from TWA\u2019s iconic flight bags, Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s LV collections have become era agnostic. The batwing sleeves and bubble skirts read as 1980s, but the board shorts and cap-toe combat boots said 1990s. The puffed-sleeve velvet tops? Space-age Elizabethan. It\u2019s the Internet age, and Ghesqui\u00e8re has intuited that we\u2019re all citizens of different decades at once. In the end, though, this was less about virtual time travel or airplane travel than it was about a destination. With his Resort shows, which tend to be more playful than his Paris collections, Ghesqui\u00e8re uses his venues as reference points. Just ahead of the 2016 Summer Olympics, his show at Rio\u2019s Niter\u00f3i Museum yielded a body-conscious, athletic lineup; last year\u2019s Resort show, at Provence\u2019s art-filled Fondation Maeght, was a toast to individualism and eclecticism. The big story here, Ghesqui\u00e8re said in a preview, \u201cwas getting back to the first feeling I had when I came to New York.\u201d Like most newcomers, he was bowled over by the city\u2019s Art Deco landmarks, bright lights, and famous round-the-clock energy. Though he played around with Wall Street pinstripes for pantsuits (as sharply tailored as ever) and shirtdresses (with an appealing everyday ease), this was a decorated, flamboyant collection, dedicated to resurrecting the disappearing art of dressing up. Voluptuous swags of panne velvet were draped over the shoulders of going-out tops, tiny bustiers were studded with crystals, and the famous Chrysler Building bas-relief was picked out in geometric metallic embroideries on a zip-front jacket, as well as on jacquards. \u201cAs a foreigner,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the clich\u00e9s.\u201d Apropos of that, layered into the mix were souvenir jackets with skyline embroideries and nods to Gotham superheroes, like Catwoman-ish skullcaps. As a rule, the glitzier it got, the better it was. Prime example: Marte Mei van Haaster\u2019s strass-lined capelet wings, which were more precious bauble than ready-to-wear and looked as if they just might\u2019ve owed a small debt to Saarinen\u2019s swooping, neo-Futurist lines."}, {"Designer": "Chanel", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The mighty house of Chanel is now a double-legacy brand that carries the DNA of both Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld, fashion giants who between them shaped the way women wanted to look for a century and more. It is a giant ship to steer, and in her debut outing at the helm, Virginie Viard kept it on an even keel in tranquil waters\u2014appropriately enough for a Cruise collection. Travel was very much on Viard\u2019s mind, and the heft of the great Chanel machine was in evidence in the incredible evocation of a dining carriage in a pre-war train, and a Belle Epoque caf\u00e9 (\u201cLe Riviera\u201d) that resembled Le Train Bleu at the Gare de Lyon perhaps, with potted palms and paintings set into elaborate boiserie and plasterwork panels suggesting the glamorous destinations the train might take you when it chugged out of the station (all of them settings for past Chanel collections). Here, in an atmosphere that evoked the sort of ambiance Chanel herself would have been familiar with as she prepared to speed off to La Pausa (the monastic house she built for herself in Roquebrune on the French Riviera in the early 1930s), breakfast was served for guests at the first of two shows, and lunch for those at the next. The collection itself was presented downstairs in the great soaring space of the Grand Palais. Although there were train tracks here, there was no train\u2014wisely, because who could eclipse the steaming trains of John Galliano\u2019s sensational Fall 1998 Haute Couture show for Christian Dior, or Marc Jacobs\u2019s no less astounding Fall 2012 presentation for Louis Vuitton. Viard instead transformed the vast space of the Grand Palais into a train platform, the audience seated on old-fashioned benches, waiting expectantly, and the building\u2019s existing Art Nouveau architecture successfully evoking a turn-of-the-century train station for giants. Viard worked alongside Lagerfeld at Chlo\u00e9 and then for more than two decades as his indispensable studio director at Chanel, and her technical savoir faire and the lessons she learned from the master were much on evidence. In place of Lagerfeld\u2019s hard-edged geometry, however, Viard brought a new softness and ease to the Chanel silhouette, reflecting her woman\u2019s perspective and something of the insouciance that Chanel herself believed in. With an audience reflecting the global reach of the brand and its pan-generational clientele\u2014including Chanel\u2019s J12 watch ambassadors Lily-Rose Depp and Ali MacGraw, and an ageless Claudia Schiffer in a scarlet sweater blazoned with the linked Cs, and worn with second-skin jeans\u2014this collection had to cover a lot of ground. It is of course a great challenge to be all things to all people and remain coherent, and Viard\u2019s mood swings saw groupings of cool Parisienne girl cotton poplin looks\u2014wide pants cropped about the ankle, frothing blouses\u2014followed by shapely Starburst-color tweed jackets worn over leggings (printed with interlocked Cs and other house emblems), and then by kawaii miniskirted classic Chanel skirtsuits in white toweling tweed (worn with adorable matching ballerina slippers with patent toes) and then by pretty, tiered chiffon or lace dresses that evoked Coco Chanel\u2019s late 1930s gitane looks, and Viard\u2019s years at Chlo\u00e9. There were images of Lagerfeld\u2019s friend, the fashion-plate Princess Caroline of Monaco in her 1980s jet-set years on Viard\u2019s inspiration board for the collection, and there was something of the flavor of that period in the bat-wing sweaters and Memphis Group pastel color-blocking that looked cool on reworked Chanel purses. A sharp scarlet or white-toed black ankle-strap shoe with a chunky cone statement heel also gave a hip styling edge to many of the looks. Viard\u2019s technical know-how was revealed in such touches as pale leather threaded with an open-work lattice of faggoting, and in the shells worn beneath those suits, or slender, unfussy evening dresses gleaming with embroidered bouquets of petals. Just as the respectful opening look had suggested the way the liberated young Chanel herself might have dressed in 2020\u2014easy black jacket with wide-leg pants cut short enough not to impede a woman on a mission, and a soft but unfussy white blouse\u2014so the final look paid homage to Lagerfeld himself in a halter dress suspended from a stiff Edwardian collar in his trademark black and white."}, {"Designer": "Prada", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Prada is destination number two of Resort season. The company\u2019s West 52nd Street Piano Factory headquarters isn\u2019t quite as exotic as Dior\u2019s torchlit Marrakech idyll looked in pictures, but there were luminaries to spare in the front rows at tonight\u2019s show: Uma Thurman and her teenage son in one section; Elle Fanning, Max Minghella, Diane Kruger, and Paul Dano in another; and a Stranger Things contingent in a third. All that star power aside, this wasn\u2019t a collection of glitz and glam. Miuccia Prada was in an understated frame of mind. Example numero uno was the spare double-breasted black coat that opened the show and the straightforward tailoring that followed it, devoid of any embellishments save for tattersall checks and minimal in the style of her \u201990s heyday. As waiters emerged with trays of drinks and small plates\u2014dinner was served after the show; there was a slew of international editors to feed\u2014Mrs. Prada chatted thoughtfully. Real, naive, and \u201cthe opposite of pretentious\u201d is how she described the collection. \u201cIt\u2019s simplicity as a protest against too much. I\u2019m sensitive to the political situation; it affects me.\u201d That\u2019s one reason she wanted to show \u201cat home.\u201d Her instinct this season was to work with cotton, a humble material put into sharp relief by the bronze duchesse satin pantsuit she wore to take her bow. There were peasant tops with smocking and handmade embroideries, striped button-downs in novel shapes, calico-print jackets and matching pants, and utility suits in solid pastels. Homey sack dresses were patch-worked from those stripes and calicos, and skirts were full and A-line\u2014a silhouette familiar to Prada fans, but somehow more girlish in its proportions, perhaps due to the high-top sneakers worn with thick ribbed socks that many of the looks padded out on. The Prada show coincided with the opening day of New York\u2019s Frieze art fair. An Alfredo Jaar piece spelling out \u201cTeach us to outgrow our madness\u201d in neon capitals made the rounds on Instagram. The dainty sturdiness of these clothes is likely to resonate with shoppers who are likewise turned off by the complexities and complications of our modern existence. Those who are simply in the mood for something pretty will find much to like here as well. Usually Mrs. P serves up her loveliness with a dash of provocation or a side of intrigue\u2014something dark\u2014but tonight pretty was enough. There was something refreshing about that."}, {"Designer": "Our Legacy", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "As we roll into a new decade, the team at Our Legacy is in a (mostly) laid-back mood. And a sort of specific one at that. Picture a family gathered in a rec room where the click and whir of the slide projector sounds out as vacation photos are projected on the wall; then imagine the way beach and ski scenes wrap and warp when someone stands up and blocks the light. This effect inspired the blurred prints in the collections as well as the overall use of transparencies. Relatively subtle were the semi-opaque inserts in shirts; bolder were sheer blue organza jeans to be worn over real denim, or skin, or anything else you might choose. A miniskirt made of this fabric worn over a long, white button-down was especially effective. Our Legacy is growing by leaps and bounds, and it felt like the designers were in the process of positioning themselves in relation to that expansion. The result was that there was less overall cohesion and more playing with opposites. This was less evident when looking at the clothing hanging on racks than in the imagery where the womenswear was presented as hard and utilitarian in contrast to the menswear which had a chiller, more accessible vibe. \u201cWhen we\u2019re exploring more feminine cuts, feminine fabrics for men, I think a lot of new things happen for us that are really interesting visually,\u201d said company cofounder Jockum Hallin. \u201cWomen\u2019s is very new for us, obviously; I think we see a strong woman wearing our stuff, [which often has] masculine shapes, but is also very feminine in a tough way.\u201d The right balance between hard and soft was found in a brown hooded wool coat and a leather-topped apron dress. Knits were strong in both categories\u2014a pair of slouchy, heavy jersey pants for the guys were especially great\u2014as was the brand\u2019s strong-selling denim. For Resort, OL jeans are light-washed and have distinctive detailing, like stitched creases, reinforced knees, or very wide legs. This more generous pant silhouette, whether in denim or not, was especially evocative of the team\u2019s interest in everything 1970s\u2014from pointed collars to graphics and colors typical of (Swedish) interiors of the era. Happily, theirs wasn\u2019t a literal translation; having made a connection between \u201970s silhouettes and 1990s (rave) ones, they then explored how that intersection interacts with today. In so doing, they found a sweet spot where legacy and topical resonance meet."}, {"Designer": "Christian Dior", "Season": "Resort", "Year": "2020", "Text": "If some mysterious Hitchcockian secret agent were to knock on the door of Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s hotel room tonight and ask, \u201cWhy did you come to Marrakech?\u201d the first answer could be very straightforward. In 1960, Yves Saint Laurent, then the head of Christian Dior, designed a coat named for the Moroccan glamour spot. Marrakech is simply in the DNA of the house. Why not bring the Resort 2020 collection to this crossroads of the world? There was, in fact, an homage to YSL\u2019s 1960 design in the collection shown tonight at the rain-blessed, bonfire-lit Palais Badi: a topper cut full, in textured cream silk, with an enveloping shawl collar, bracelet sleeves, and a knife-pleated skirt to match. It is exquisite, respectful, authorizing . . . but it is not Chiuri\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre. Just like in Hitchcock\u2019s vision of Morocco, nothing is ever as it initially appears. Tonight Maria Grazia came to North Africa to show a collection about luxury, globalism, and culture. The predominant fabrics featured were toile du jouy, but a toile wholly designed and produced as a wax print in the Ivory Coast city of Abidjan by a studio/atelier named Uniwax. Uniwax makes authentic African wax prints on cotton. These are the real deal: double-faced, gloriously and intentionally imperfect, labor intensive, narrative, and expressive. A number of months ago Chiuri brought to Uniwax her toiles of seasons past\u2014with her jungle creatures, wacky flora, and tarot card allusions\u2014and asked the folks there to design their versions of these motifs and to print in their ideal palette (one a mix of ochre/garnet/navy/emerald, the other navy/cream). The results involve massive lions, winged mythological creatures, glowering birds, and funny references to the numbers and words associated with the tarot (10, 27, Le Monde). These substantial cotton toiles form the basis of suits and jumpsuits, empire ball gowns and capacious jackets. The shapes are largely familiar to lovers of Chiuri\u2019s Dior\u2014boyish outerwear with girlish frocks, anti-fit pants with crisp curvaceous jackets, and cool bowling shirts just because. The clothes are terrific\u2014and yes, let\u2019s wear print head to toe, why not?\u2014but the story behind the clothes is even better. Dutch wax print is a product that has a multicultural past, involving Asia, Europe, and Africa. It is also a product that has been cheapened by crude, widely used digital imitations. And so, in a moment of increasing cultural isolation and polarization, Chiuri is arguing against narrow-mindedness in design and production. Also, for Dior to champion authentic wax prints is to make a global statement that an African textile can embody luxury at the highest level. Maria Grazia Chiuri is a woman who knows too much, and Uniwax was only one of five significant collaborations in this Resort outing. A Moroccan women\u2019s textile and ceramics association called Sumano created the more tapestry-like woven pieces in the collection, including the fringed coat of Look 1. The American artist Mickalene Thomas and the Jamaican-British designer Grace Wales Bonner each provided their own interpretation of the New Look: Thomas\u2019s featured a Bar jacket entirely beaded on the back in one her collaged prints, while Wales Bonner augmented her precision tailoring with raffia embroideries. A designer from the Ivory Coast named Monsieur Path\u00e9\u2019O, who was known for making Nelson Mandela\u2019s shirts, designed a look for the collection featuring the late ANC leader\u2019s face on the back. And Stephen Jones collaborated with a Ghanaian-British milliner named Martine Henry on the head wraps or turbans of unspecific ethnic origin. Everything was about the joys of collaboration and a kind of polyglot, artisanal reverie. There were dresses encrusted with Murano glass beads, because those very beads originated in Venice but found their way to Africa. There were interpretations of the Uniwax toiles in double-face cashmere and silk jacquard, so in other words, African prints reworked by small European mills. It\u2019s a lot of backstory to tell about some absolutely lovely, low-key clothes (including four white lace dresses for bohemian brides, three jersey columns for mothers of those brides, two red carpet gowns in chocolate and cardinal, and one super-groovy denim jumpsuit). But fashion is changing and the where, the why, and the how of design has never mattered more. We all need to buy less and buy better, to invest in items made with care, respect, and love. We don\u2019t need the digital imitations; we need the real deal. This is perhaps the finest realization thus far of Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s insistent vision of a global feminism accessed through fashion. Christian Dior under her guidance doesn\u2019t have to try to be cool, because it\u2019s right and that\u2019s chic."}, {"Designer": "A D\u00e9tacher", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "A D\u00e9tacher fans, brace yourselves: Fall 2019 is Mona Kowalska\u2019s last collection. She said business is good, and her Nolita shop will keep its doors open through the summer, but she\u2019s been wanting to step back and focus on other creative projects for a while. Every time she felt ready to make the announcement, though, she came up with another piece she wanted to design, which evolved into more pieces, then a full collection . . . . In other words, she hasn\u2019t just run out of ideas. The cornerstone of her Fall 2019 collection was a reversible jersey dress with a trompe l\u2019oeil slip superimposed on the front. \u201cI like the idea that even if you reverse it, it\u2019s like you\u2019re layering a slip under your dress,\u201d she said. It could be worn a third way, too: folded down and belted as a skirt. The rest of the collection mostly consisted of archival pieces and reissued prints, some of them nearly two decades old (Kowalska launched the label in 1998): a single-arm cape, a boxy padded jacket, a knitted jumpsuit. They\u2019re easy, slightly off-kilter pieces that still look modern, and to Kowalska, that\u2019s the best note to end on. She was hesitant to speak about her \u201clegacy,\u201d but summed it up thus: \u201cI think we made a lot of really beautiful things, we pushed the envelope, and we did it seriously. We did it with the idea of longevity\u2014we can pull something out from 17 years ago and it still looks up-to-date.\u201d It\u2019s in direct opposition to the industry\u2019s current anxious pace and demand for newness. \u201cEverything in fashion is fast now,\u201d she said. \u201cEven fashion is fast-fashion.\u201d Kowalska is understandably concerned with fashion\u2019s impact on the environment and people; she works closely with artisans in Peru on her knitwear, and in general favored slow, small-scale production for her label (and, again, made pieces meant to last a few decades). We\u2019re in a moment where designers are excited to talk about sustainability, but Kowalska isn\u2019t convinced the industry as a whole has done enough to make significant changes. A designer\u2019s efforts are just a drop in the bucket of a much larger issue. \u201cIf you look at the food industry, it did a really good job of communicating [about] organic food,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cOrganic is now the norm. People understand that there\u2019s a difference in terms of price and quality, and I don\u2019t think the fashion industry has done that.\u201d She ended with some food for thought for her contemporaries and the new guard: \u201cLive your politics.\u201d You can\u2019t complain about Trump\u2019s climate change policies and then produce your collection in factories with dubious environment and social standards. The same goes for consumers who need to make educated shopping decisions. It\u2019s helpful to think about fashion the way we think about food: Both are something we consume, and buying one consciously made dress\u2014rather than a dozen poorly made ones\u2014is arguably \u201cbetter for you\u201d both physically and emotionally."}, {"Designer": "A.

Albino is an experienced designer with considerable tailoring skills. His coats and pantsuits are cut with chic precision; a refined color sense adds to the sophisticated equation of his style. He favors grown-up but not bourgeois, feminine with a hint of double-entendre\u2014 think Bourdin more than Avedon. He has a modern eye for neat construction, but he isn\u2019t clich\u00e9d or banal. Women look good in his clothes. One wonders why a designer of such talent doesn\u2019t perform on a larger international stage. But this is just one of the many unsolved mysteries of fashion. For Fall, the designer focused on uniform-inspired outerwear, referencing the strictness of noble portraiture. Double-breasted coats and peacoats in brushed wool cashmere were cut straight with aplomb, while the sharp tailoring of masculine pantsuits was mitigated by vibrant hues of lagoon green or bougainvillea pink. The bright color palette presaged a more decorative note in the evening offering. Elaborate, aristocratic heraldry visuals were suggested in the curlicued motifs printed on quilted silk twill blanket capes, on long padded robe coats worn over matching tunics, or else on a chiffon blouse with an asymmetrical side panel worn over slim cigarette pants. Couture-inspired flourishes were apparent in the asymmetrical drapings on taffeta column dresses or blouses paired with matching slim pants in vivid tones of cobalt blue and fuchsia, as well as in the ruched sleeves of a black evening blazer and the ruffled shoulders of a short black tunic layered over a white skirt. Elegant tailoring and occasion dressing seem to be back in favor. It could be a good moment for Teodoro to successfully expand his collection, taking it to a more consistent, upgraded level.

To complement this dynamic footage, Vandevorst explained, they chose bright colors like chartreuse and violet that popped on-screen, working off a rough vision of a young American girl running around the countryside in her parents\u2019 clothes.

Koller, the fashion director of M magazine at Le Monde, designed the collection\u2019s long caftan-like black wool dress and an oversize parka that she teamed with a monochrome look in gray: chunky sweater, fine-gauge turtleneck, wool trousers, and leather boots.

The first section\u2014looks 1 through 17\u2014 came sound-tracked by \u201cCowgirl\u201d but was far less messy than the tune. This was wide-awake A.W.A.K.E, focused in its slickness and relative minimalism. Key pieces included square-quilted leather coats, cleverly tailored dresses in a sort of stretch sheer pinstripe fabric, and totally Trinity-from-The Matrix\u2013appropriate back-to-front black leather pants and elongated-cuff black leather shirtdresses. Then, immediately after a handsome caramel pleat-skirted and wide-lapeled dress, whoosh: There was a pause, the room darkened (hard on the photographers), and to a soundtrack of aria over bagpipes we red-pilled into another place. Somewhere between Highlander and Outlander, it saw Alaverdian mix tartans and frock coats and argyles and botanical-print tabards in a highly imaginative mishmash. It featured plenty of dresses that combined full, furled necklines and northward-bound skirt-slits. A one-shoulder, two tartan, braid-faced look signaled the end of this 10-look aside. The the lights came up again and we were back to Underworld: \u201cBorn Slippy.\u201d Not quite but almost a meeting between the first part and the second, this third and final section reimposed some of the rigor we\u2019d seen at the start, but went happily to town on the pattern and detail. Punk pants and kilts reflected the safety pins that held some garments together. A not-dissimilar-to-DAKS check was used in a button-skirted boatneck dress and slim pants with slashes at the leg, teamed with a cut-out close-cut top. There were more glimpses than before of this designer\u2019s long-explored hybrid pieces: a pleated skirt with jacket-skirt peplum, and her favorite deconstructed pants/skirt. Simultaneously expansive and precise, the double deployment of Underworld pointed at another Scottish reference: Trainspotting. \u201cI wanted to show there was a reality within a reality within a reality,\u201d said Alaverdian afterwards.

That same Madagascar factory is responsible for the elaborate embroidery on a charming red organza dress that looked like heirloom napkins sewn together. As with Pre-Fall, Lippes took the cues for his rich materials from Studio Peregalli, the Italian architecture and design firm known for its poetic mix of time periods, cultures, colors, and textures. Of special note was the deep red paisley he used for a pleated skirt with placement prints at the hem and a hooded coat\u2014treated to be water repellant, he noted. Luxury has long been essential to the Lippes aesthetic, but more and more he\u2019s considering the social and ecological implications of his business.

In conceptualizing her previous Adeam collections, she\u2019s looked to the rebellious breakthrough of Japanese women in the 1920s and the origination of the Harajuku punk girl during the \u201990s. Her interpretations of these zeitgeist moments in Japan are never literal or derivative; instead they nod, ever so slightly, to the signs of those times through beautifully tailored silhouettes. For Fall 2019, Maeda went back in time once again, but instead of focusing on one time, place, or style, she zoned in on a very specific group of indigenous people. The designer borrowed from the Ainu people of Hokkaido, one of the oldest tribes in Japan, known for their dedication to living in harmony with nature. They perfected the art of crafting textiles and garments often dyed using natural shades from flowers and plants. The Ainu also specialized in detailed prints meant to symbolize spirituality and the world around them. Maeda paid homage to the Ainu culture by trimming nearly every piece with texture in the form of lace, fringed ribbon, or pleating. Her main goal, she said in a preview of today\u2019s show, was to shed light on the artisanship that was born out of Hokkaido. She wanted this season to feel handmade and organic, and she certainly succeeded with pieces like the yellow corseted jacket and the apron dress with a geometric print (look closely and you\u2019ll make out the cleverly hidden Adeam logo). A fuchsia suit was sharp as well, as was the dramatic, strapless finale gown and a two-tone denim dress with balloon sleeves. Maeda\u2019s aim was to turn our attention away from modern technology, at least momentarily, and give praise to the ancestors who first put their hands to a garment and made it into something spectacular. She is an artisan in her own right, and this season was proof of that."}, {"Designer": "Akris", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "The runway was extra narrow at Akris today. Designer Albert Kriemler intended it to be; he wanted us to see his fabrics close-up. Akris is famous for its St. Gallen embroidery, and there were some fine examples of it on a pair of dresses in the most delicate of black lace, though these were more or less covered by coats. Outerwear and suiting were the focus of Kriemler\u2019s effective collection for Fall. Backstage, he was discussing investment pieces. He\u2019s picked up on the fact that tailoring is the big talking point of the season. \u201cFor us it\u2019s a culture, not something we do to be trendy. But it is nice to fit into the moment better than anyone else.\u201d Kriemler\u2019s two art preoccupations this season\u2014he almost always references art\u2014were Richard Artschwager\u2019s All in Good Time horsehair exclamation points and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\u2019s Farbtafel prints of the early 1800s, which look remarkably modern 200 years later. Artschwager was quite loosely referenced in the first and last looks of the collection. Coco Rocha\u2019s double-face coat was impressively inset with colorblocks of horsehair embroidery, and Dilone\u2019s halter-neck gown featured a cut-out on the back in the vague shape of that declarative punctuation mark. The cues Kriemler took from Goethe were more direct: his prints appeared on a shirtdress, a \u201960s-ish mod shift, and a pantsuit. In contrast to those graphic seasonal collector\u2019s items, the investment pieces were the subtler elements of the collection. Despite their discretion, this is what stood out: an ivory pulled-wool coat that looked like shearling but weighed almost nothing in comparison; a black cashmere corduroy pantsuit with a fashionable oversize, boxy fit; and St. Gallen wool-on-tulle embroidery that looked deceptively like a cardigan jacket, worn with matching plaid trousers. \u201cTo feel well in the clothes,\u201d said Kriemler. \u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Alberta Ferretti", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Alberta Ferretti should be credited for trying to get out of her comfort zone; her style has moved away from the ethereal occasion dressing she has always favored to land on more consistent daywear territories. \u201cTimes are constantly changing, and women\u2019s needs are, too,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to keep up with today\u2019s fast-paced reality.\u201d No arguing with that, and it seems to be a smart move: Aeffe, Alberta Ferretti\u2019s parent company, apparently posted a 10.9 percent uptick in sales in 2018. This collection certainly offered plenty of daywear options. The show\u2019s first look was an assertive head-to-toe winter-white outerwear statement: an ensemble of leather wide-leg pants and a sporty jacket layered under a voluminous mohair coat, accessorized to the nines with matching white suede cowboy boots and a wide-brimmed felt hat. If Ferretti wanted to make a strong point, she did. \u201cFashion is all about daring to express one\u2019s own unique personality with courage and eccentricity,\u201d she stated. \u201cNobody wants to look invisible.\u201d It\u2019s certainly true that looking invisible in an all-white look is rarely an option. The designer upped the eccentricity factor with au courant mix-and-match styling attitude, while the actual pieces, taken individually, were mainly wardrobe staples designed with Ferretti-esque imaginative flair. There were high-waisted, \u201980s-inspired washed denim or intarsia leather pants over frilled, chunky-knitted sweaters; soft tailored masculine pantsuits; metallic leather and suede patchworked trench coats. Eveningwear has always been the designer\u2019s forte; here, her romantic, flimsy dresses were replaced by \u201980s-redolent blouses and wide-leg pants in silver and gold lam\u00e9, or black minidresses in plumetis and lace. They will surely appeal to all the young influencers crowding the show\u2019s front row. Yet Ferretti understands sensuous, grown-up glamour: For serious red carpet appeal, the long white number with an embellished bodice worn by Bella Hadid or the black-and-silver one-ruffle-shouldered see-through gown on Vittoria Ceretti will be winning head-turners.

Her two-for-one reversible shearlings certainly count as investment pieces. And if you like the cut of a suit, the snugness of a bustier, or the bias drape of a skirt, you don\u2019t have to worry that you\u2019ll never see them again; even as Rojas develops new silhouettes, she evolves existing ones. This season, she\u2019s rethought a best seller by cropping it from floor length to ankle length, for example. Still, there\u2019s never a lack of newness in Rojas\u2019s collections. \u201cI feel I like them better every season,\u201d she says. \u201cThey keep getting smaller but more cohesive, so I\u2019m loving that.\u201d The main draw for Fall 2019 is a stunning palette that\u2019s richer and deeper than any the designer has worked with previously. There are greens that range from emerald to malachite, raspberries, reds, an irresistible burnt orange, some of which were pulled from the paintings of Tamara de Lempicka and Maruja Mallo. Rojas was unafraid to mix these, a navy-and-red suede midi was notable. Tempering these warm tones were a series of ice blue pieces. Touches of camel were representative of the equestrian theme that ran through the collection; its most obvious expression was a hand-drawn print of running horses (Rojas\u2019s spirit animal). Rojas wanted to capture something of the unbridled freedom of a galloping steed in her Fall collection. Ease was a catchword: As she was designing evening options, like d\u00e9grad\u00e9 slip dresses with \u201930s flair and a new bias-cut stunner with high neck and darts, she was thinking of the sort of undone glamour of a woman, sunk deep into a chair after returning home from a party. Ease is a relative concept, however. Wherever she may reside, Rojas\u2019s woman has a rather polished, uptown sensibility, which is one of the reasons the clothes work so well in the urbane and cultured environs of Galerie Michael Bargo (its walls hung with kinetic sculptures by Luke Todd), where the lookbook images were shot."}, {"Designer": "Alena Akhmadullina", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Alena Akhmadullina is flying from a two-day business trip in New York back to Moscow today to take meetings with her private clients.

(Not present at the appointment, probably due to customs, but visible in the lookbook was a strapless ball gown made fully out of python that felt excessive.) A good idea for Akhmadullina would be to think about producing pieces, such as that red-hot jumpsuit, in other materials for those not comfortable wearing animal products."}, {"Designer": "Alessandra Rich", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cOh my Goddd . . . so cool . . . so extra . . . so fresh . . . so fashion!\u201d That assessment of this Alessandra Rich show echoed up the red-carpeted stairwell as the hairspray-suffused, client-heavy audience poured forth down from the marble-walled private apartment that was again her venue and into the clot of Mercedes that waited on Avenue President Wilson below. The vibe in the room was certainly pumped as Rich\u2019s crew considered a collection that contrasted the apparently prim with the purportedly provocative. These ingredients were presented at an approximately 1:3 ratio of Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman before she goes shopping on Rodeo Drive, against after. The prim spanned \u201940s-cut sweetheart dresses, mid-length, in feather print and polka dot, to tightly fitted but immaculately cut jersey jackets and skirts with ornate buttons and multiple pockets. These came accessorized with sparkling drop earrings, necklaces, and headbands of white marabou.

But when you put the choker on, you send that sort of message which is that, for you, you want.\u201d But isn\u2019t there an implication of submissiveness in the chokers and the body chains? \u201cNo! It\u2019s very much about control. My women are always in control. They are dressing for themselves, absolutely. They like being able to wear something very proper but also being able to wear something like one of my body chains underneath.

Let\u2019s begin with her sharp, inventive tailoring. There are trouser suits with a strong but narrow shoulder in which a drape of wool flows from the nipped waistline with a selvage announcing to all: Made in England. There are suits built of two different scales of pinstripes or checks, which, up close, look both classical and punk\u2014no easy trick. There is a tuxedo jacket with an elegantly slashed shoulder, and another in black wool silk with fuchsia satin sleeves, draped to resemble cascading flower petals. And then let\u2019s talk about those flowers: dresses of black, scarlet, or (yet more) fuchsia taffeta, constructed by a thicket of tucks at the bodice from which explodes wild yardages of fabric sculpted to resemble enormous roses. These are fascinating creations because they proceed entirely from the fine manipulation of a volume of fabric. They are extraordinary\u2014essentially couture\u2014and will no doubt make their way to a red carpet soon, if not worn first by a duchess. Actually, the other roses in the collection\u2014those that are photo printed, overblown, cut up, repurposed, abstracted, and sewn into neat party dresses of duchess (!) satin with sweetheart necklines and Victorian bustles\u2014well, those should be a must-have for that certain royal as well as the rest of us common people. As is always the case at McQueen, there are pieces in the collection for the few (evening dresses with tiers of ruffles attached by functional hook and eyes and embroideries of birds indigenous to the north of England) and others for the many (filmy knits that, from a distance, resemble chiffon; a dress of white denim with a rose at the shoulder and a shredded hem). There\u2019s something otherworldly going on here and something profoundly democratic. . . . Which is not surprising given the backstory. To research this collection, Burton took her team to northern cities outside of Manchester, to Macclesfield, where she was raised, and nearby towns where mills still produce the textiles used for men\u2019s suits in the United Kingdom and abroad. For the show, the audience sat on bolts of fabric from these mills, the very made-in-England wools used in the collection (both for the samples and, ultimately, the production). Burton wanted to showcase the products, tradition, and culture of the England in which she was raised: the woolens, the local festival traditions (in which there are rose queens), the history of suffrage and its white-clad campaigners, the Bront\u00ebs (regional heroines), and the codes of punk and new wave, which are ingrained in Burton even if she is too young to have seen Joy Division before it all went tragic. There is a silver dress in the collection that appears to be made of elongated metal paillettes, but the show notes reveal it was made from a loom\u2019s heddles cut into sequins and studded with bugle beads. The noise the dress makes as one walks is meant to mimic the sound of a shop floor. And there is a coat of Prince of Wales check in which the skirt is covered in a swirly, ruffled embroidery made from the scraps of selvage edges left on the cutting room floor. This coat is one of the chicest nods to upcycling in any collection, and perhaps the only instance of upcycling from a major house this season. It is both elegant and relevant. And this is perhaps the real triumph of Burton\u2019s collection. At a time when we need to think local to act globally, she has brought work to the towns of the north (where residents may have voted for the Brexit in large numbers but whose businesses will suffer when it eventually goes through, save for companies such as McQueen). In a moment when we need to reuse and recycle, she has pieced together dresses from remnants and scraps and made embellishments out of industrial materials. And right now, when we need to buy less and buy better (which is the only way to change from a culture of waste to one of value), she has made thoughtful, soulful, beautifully rendered garments that speak volumes about where we have come from and where we are headed. It doesn\u2019t get better than that."}, {"Designer": "Alexander Wang", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Alexander Wang kicked off a trio of name-in-lights shows happening in New York this week. When he went rogue in June, presenting his Spring 2019 collection three months ahead of the rest of the American industry, he was a definite outlier. There remains a question of whether it helps or hurts a designer to be removed from the heat of New York Fashion Week, but now Wang\u2019s got Versace and Chanel for company. He made an event of it at the former Williamsburg Savings Bank in Brooklyn tonight, with a Champagne-and-caviar pre-party and a boldface guest in the form of Sophia Robot who posed for front row pics. The collection picked up where his June show left off. That one was an examination of his Chinese-American roots and his status as an immigrant. It mashed up chinoiserie with Axl Rose bandanas and punk safety pins. This one, Wang said, was a \u201ccelebration of the American hustle. We\u2019re taking stereotypes of class and wealth and trying to remix them, giving status symbols a new sensibility.\u201d The impulse, he explained, was equally related to his upbringing. He grew up a private school kid in San Francisco, a radically different experience than that of his older siblings. \u201cThere was always a question of where I fit in.\u201d This played out on the runway as a fusion of uptown and downtown elements, some of which blended more successfully than others: sherbet-color tweed suiting accompanied by black leather apron skirts, camel coats topping boxer shorts, or T-shirts paired back to tuxes. Icons of the upper crust\u2014tennis sweaters, rugby shirts, and polos\u2014were tweaked with asymmetric cuts or unlikely materials like safety pins. Brass W buckles looked like a play on Hermes\u2019s famous H. As for the leather and leopard-spot garment bags that many of the models wore slung over their shoulders, Wang said they were inspired by images of 1980s career types toggling between the office and the health club. They\u2019re unlikely It bag contenders. But Wang does have a way with denim\u2014see: the peeled-over waistband jeans, which looked coolly relatable with boxy blazers and bankers\u2019 button-downs. So, where does Wang fit in? It\u2019s been roughly a dozen years since he emerged, a downtown wunderkind with a flair for cool. Now, he\u2019s in experimental mode, arguably out front in his efforts to align customers\u2019 emerging habits with the industry\u2019s old systems. But writing your middle chapter isn\u2019t always easy. Was he trying to tell us something with a series of \u201980s-ish shirts that spelled out pain? Who knows.

She used the word fantasia to describe her Fall 2019 collection, which punctuated the room and referenced a modern fairy tale, romance, and magic. Bendet\u2019s imagination is like a swirling lollipop of color and sparkle, and while there was plenty of that throughout this season\u2019s lineup, she insisted that her aim was to take things down a notch (notch, being the operative word here) in terms of embellishment and vibrancy, and focus on making really sexy clothes. Many of the pieces were visibly more sexy than her usual bunch as far as the silhouettes were concerned\u2014a slip with a thigh-high slit; a deep V-neck; wrap minidresses; a cropped tube top. And yet, much of it was still heavily beaded and printed, like the gowns bedecked with a psychedelic butterfly motif and the rainbow skirt made entirely of feathers.

Silky black puffer jackets were also strong and glinted with the sort of sensitive snarl that can be loosely used to describe the Alyx aesthetic.

Ski-masked, often helmeted, and of course yellow jacketed, they chanted and shook their fists\u2014in a comradely fashion\u2014at the watching fashion cluster. Upstairs in the space at the Hyatt there was more direct action, this time aimed in my direction. Back in London, I gave the last Vivienne Westwood collection a critical going-over, based on the idea that urging us not to buy clothes for the sake of sustainability while selling us clothes seems an unsustainably contradictory position. Here in Paris (at her company\u2019s second show of the season), Westwood was seated two seats away from me\u2014Carine Roitfeld was our borderland. I sat down, and Westwood leaned over. \u201cAre you Luke?\u201d asked the designer I\u2019ve interviewed perhaps 20 times during the past few years, on occasion for so long that I\u2019ve nearly missed her show, watching it from backstage. Once I agreed that I was, she suggested I am an \u201cidiot,\u201d a \u201cclimate change denier,\u201d and \u201ca tool of the financial system.\u201d The right to reply is sacrosanct, and Westwood is entitled to hers. However, disagreeing with the wisdom of lecturing a captive audience of editors and celebrities on the threat of climate change while holding a fashion show isn\u2019t climate change denial; it\u2019s in this case Westwood denial. And given that Westwood\u2019s business last reported annual revenues in the tens of millions through the sale of high-margin, internationally distributed luxury consumer goods, I bet I know who\u2019s got the larger carbon footprint. This keyboard eco-warrior\u2019s opinion is that Westwood\u2019s undisputed brilliance as one of the most gifted and influential fashion designers in history does not automatically mean she\u2019s brilliant at messaging her undoubtedly sincere concerns about climate change. As for the clothes, the collection was sometimes excellent, and any worries that might have been caused by Kronthaler\u2019s in-the-mirror selfie \u201cdick pick invitation\u201d\u2014as a fellow audience member termed it\u2014proved unfounded. Quarterback-silhouette coats in knit boucl\u00e9 and their jacketed equivalents as suits in rich silk brocades were powerful. There was a deconstructed interrogation of exoticism in the semi-shrouding of knitwear whose collars dropped straight from the chin and forehead to the shoulder, and another inversion of convention in the closing menswear wild-bridal look. However, all of Kronthaler\u2019s work\u2014the meandering necklines and slept-in bedsheet rumple and gather of his beautiful, wonkily fitted evening gowns\u2014was suffused in spirit by the work of his great muse, love, and inspiration, Dame Vivienne Westwood."}, {"Designer": "Andrew Gn", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Andrew Gn\u2019s couture approach to ready-to-wear (not to mention his expansive personality) has endeared him to society ladies for years now. This season, he surprised them by switching tack, dialing back on the surface embellishments he\u2019s known for in favor of fabric development and construction. The result was one of his strongest shows in recent memory. The designer said that the \u201960s drama The World of Suzy Wong, which he saw again recently after first watching it as a kid, had stuck with him. \u201cI always thought there was something different about the star, Nancy Kwan,\u201d said Gn. He later learned that her father was Chinese and her mother was Scottish. Soon after, he came across a still of Grace Kelly wearing a traditional cheongsam, and it clicked. \u201cIt\u2019s very covered up, but for me the cheongsam is the sexiest dress the Chinese ever created,\u201d he said. Gn and his atelier dove deep into construction techniques, developing python and zebra jacquard or snakeskin lace and using them as panels, inserts, and overlays with cut velvet jacquard and taffeta. An early geometric jacquard coat with feather sleeves signaled this new direction, and that initial black-and-white series flowed into a masterful exercise in color blocking. (Said Gn after the show: \u201cI am a colorist. I don\u2019t wear a lot, but I love it.\u201d) Emerald green snake appliqu\u00e9s on sharply tailored coats and jackets were another striking departure. Toward the end, the designer pushed the cheongsam idea into a trapeze dress embroidered with silver stars and rhinestones that is probably already packed up and on its way to a red carpet somewhere. Other groupings hewed more to familiar signatures, such as butterfly frogging on a flounce-sleeved top with a mandarin collar, and a royal blue coat or a white crepe dress. The guipure dresses with 3-D appliqu\u00e9s were also classic Gn. Elsewhere, he transposed a chrysanthemum motif from a Japanese Meiji period vase onto a series of dresses, most strikingly on a chartreuse midi with hand-braided fringe. Those kinds of special, limited-series pieces are something Gn\u2019s core customer counts on. Now that he has his e-commerce business squared, Gn is building out his business incrementally both online and off. He\u2019s in talks to open a store in Hong Kong early next year, but in the meantime, he says, he\u2019s finding pop-ups an ideal way to connect personally with his base.

Specifically: the Wide White Space Gallery, which became home to artists including Marcel Broodthaers, Joseph Beuys, James Lee Byars, and many others. Byars, in particular, staged his performances in Antwerp and became very linked to the city that also brought Ann Demeulemeester to the fore. Today, Byars\u2019s works can be seen in front of the label\u2019s stores. Byars\u2019s \u201cGiant\u201d installations\u2014huge bands of fabric rolled out all over the city\u2014and his favorite colors became the starting point for a Demeulemeester collection that looked lighter than usual, in white, red, pink, violet, and anise green. \u201cIt\u2019s almost psychedelic, in a way,\u201d Meunier allowed, as he reached for qualifiers. Finally, he settled on \u201cmystico-Seventies.\u201d In that vein, there were a number of loose maxi dresses designed with transformability in mind: Those can be hitched up, tightened, draped, or shortened as the wearer sees fit. Elsewhere, the house\u2019s weeping willow aesthetic came through in layers of spider-web knits, transparent overlayers, pooling hoodies, fluid brocades, and feathered and fringed harnesses. Demeulemeester fans will gravitate toward the fluffy feather jackets over liquid satins; a layered tuxedo jacket with a brocade lapel and a black coat with a moonlight lining also looked sharp. Those tall hats, too, are a Byars signature. \u201cByars was always looking for perfection, beauty, and a certain truth,\u201d said Meunier, adding that an obsession with perfection was something the artist and the house\u2019s founding designer shared. Perfection does not belong to this world, of course, but meanwhile, Meunier offered his clients what they need for the thrill of the chase."}, {"Designer": "Anna Sui", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "There is a common parlance in the Garment District, where Anna Sui has maintained her studio since she started her operation in the late \u201980s, that refers to the fashion business as the \u201crag trade.\u201d Sui might have built an ample empire, but hers is the dream trade above all else. She christened her Fall 2019 collection \u201cPoptimism,\u201d taking guests at her runway show on a romp through the saturated secondary colors of early \u201960s concert posters, tweely posh dress-up clothing, and a soundtrack that mashed up Nico and Snail Mail. This Pop-optimistic mood was the latest in Sui\u2019s multi-season journey to find a calm from the storm of the world. For Fall, she painted a topsy-turvy picture of the early \u201960s, with short little dresses in shades more shocking than Schiap pink, and models in technicolor wigs inspired by Anna Karina\u2019s wedding day bouffant. Color was a big story, with Sui pulling electric tones from the work of Verner Panton, Mary Blair, and David Weidman. There were strange granny-dress mash-ups of knits and silks; resplendent faux-fur coats with matching shaggy hats; an acid green feather-trimmed brocade suit; and plenty of cocktail frocks and jumpsuits so heavily beaded that the models klickity-klacked as they strutted the runway. Sui\u2019s intense research leaves no surface unconsidered, but this season she may have outdone herself by having her custom crepe patterns made into rich brocades, so you can swaddle yourself in her winding blooms no matter the vibe. What purpose do these sweet, swinging \u201960s things have now? It\u2019s a rejection of the casual, a celebration of capital-D dressing. If Sui\u2019s longtime friend Marc Jacobs is bringing back proportions and poufs, Sui is making equally as dreamy clothes for day. In 53 exits there might have been one or to two puffers and a sole nylon windbreaker, but be certain, this collection was about the ceremony of fashion, the way a full-on proper outfit can change your life. Sui would know. The concert poster backdrop was a page pulled from her own history. Growing up in the Detroit area, she was too young to get into the Grande Ballroom, so she had an older friend collect show bills designed by Carl Lundgren and Gary Grimshaw for her. Those local legends provided the posters for tonight\u2019s show. Her references aren\u2019t just things to stick on a mood board\u2014they are the story of herself. In her life and career, she has gone from a Detroit dreamer to one of New York\u2019s most lasting fashion stars.

It\u2019s a smart way of taking direct control of every aspect of a label\u2019s operations, from communication to distribution, which appeals to high-end designers with experience, a strong vision, and an independent mindset. In this choice, he\u2019s definitely not alone: There are quite a few creatives in fashion today embracing a more personal way to relate to their audience. Berardi was born in 1968 and, as with his Pre-Fall collection, he took that groundbreaking moment in time as a starting point. \u201cIt was tumultuous, a year which changed so many attitudes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd where so many new ideas were born.\u201d Indeed: the riots in Paris; a man orbiting the moon; the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy; the Black Power salute at the Olympics. \u201cThere are so many similarities to now,\u201d Berardi said. We cannot argue with that; today\u2019s reality is certainly as intense as those years were. The end of the \u201960s also marked a major shift in style\u2014in a there\u2019s-no-going-back move, high-fashion met the street for the first time. \u201cThe safari jacket, the jumpsuit,\u201d Berardi continued. \u201cFashion then was geometrically precise, yet soft, romantic.\u201d He wanted to capture that spirit of freedom and haute bohemia while treating sensuous fluidity to the exact, razor-sharp cutting technique at which he excels. The collection, focused on eveningwear, had the designer indulging his penchant for dramatic style. He played with contrasting overblown volumes and feminine shapes, which were rendered sculptural and chiseled. Undulating, shapely frills and ruffles on a short shift dress exuded a theatrical flair, more couture-ish than whimsical; a flowing chiffon caftan printed in pink camouflage motifs had a built-in bejeweled bodice and jacket. Highlighting the inventive work on shapes and cut, a sinuous long dress in flame red silk cady had a balloon cape; and a figure-hugging number in bougainvillea pink paired with a matching sleeveless round-shaped cape-jacket had billowy slit sleeves. You could easily picture an Oscar-winning actress looking fabulous in it. Ditto a white silk cady column dress with a sexy bejeweled lace-up motif on one side, apparently inspired by the 1968 YSL safari jacket. Strong personalities are naturally drawn to Berardi\u2019s sensational creations, from Lady Gaga to Olivia Colman. That\u2019s one reason why he has chosen to shoot the lookbook\u2019s images on real women, whose characters resonates with his aesthetic. After having involved his editor friends and the Swedish artist and activist Arvida Bystrom, this season he had the collection modeled by Australian-born, Paris-based stylist Catherine Baba. \u201cShe looks more French than a Parisian,\u201d he mused. Her personal look relates to a certain idea of glamour that this collection exuded. \u201cClothes definitely need to be interpreted by a strong personality and become part of someone else\u2019s universe to be given life,\u201c he said. \u201cThose clothes, they will have experiences all of their own.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Antonio Marras", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cI will never forget her. Her huge curious and velvety eyes.\u201d Amedeo Modigliani\u2014yes, that Modigliani\u2014was the scion of a Tuscan family that became wealthy through mining and that brought the young artist-to-be to Sardinia, where they operated their business. While he was there, he painted a portrait of Medea Taci, a local hotel owner\u2019s daughter, for whom it is believed he developed a youthful crush. This fantastic Antonio Marras collection was built around an imagined letter\u2014imagined by Patrizia, Antonio\u2019s wife\u2014sent from Modigliani later in life to an old friend who had shared that time in Sardinia. The idea was that it mixed memories of the Sardinian coal miners and their partners taking their passeggiata with a sense of nostalgic longing for Taci (who in real life died early). A quick Google search shows that Modigliani\u2019s juvenile portrait of Taci\u2014while excellently executed\u2014was conventional in style and nothing like the proto-modernist technique through which the artist found controversy and fame. Marras re-created Taci in that style on an illustration on knee-high socks and reflected the look of Taci herself in the short bangs worn by the female models. All this background was the creative context for a collection that beautifully showcased the virtuosity of Marras\u2019s jackdaw maximalism. The menswear looks mingled vintage finds with new garments and even ties that were originally the property of Marras\u2019s father: The idea was to give a sense of clothes nurtured, patched, passed down, and cherished afresh. Camo was mixed with corduroy. Quilted arms were stitched onto tweed jackets. The men wore German army trainers\u2014the greatest surplus sneaker\u2014and Vibram-soled work boots. The womenswear was less reliant on vintage\u2014a long section of olive drill army jackets and liners tricked out with frogging and embroidery apart\u2014but it was just as intensely various. Lace, embroidery, crystals, and tulle were arranged in apparent disharmony to make intensely attractive wholes. We were in the studio space next to Marras\u2019s gorgeous south-of-town store, and it was a tight fit. The models came down from the store, then crossed one another\u2019s path again and again as they made their way around the studio. At first the photographers howled at each obscured shot, but after five minutes or so, they gave up. To cap this, a troupe of actors was reading Modigliani\u2019s \u201cletter\u201d in increasingly melodramatic tones as the show went on. By the end of it they were running around clutching coupes of Prosecco and roaring with memories of the imagined good old days. As well as a tolerance for histrionics, one needs both patience and a pre-Instagram attention span to get into Marras, but the clothes that emerge from his and Patrizia\u2019s huge and curious conceptual spin cycle of Sardinia-seeped bohemian mythologizing are well worth that price of entry."}, {"Designer": "Area", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Six months ago, Area was all about playfulness. This season, that flippant joy has given way to something more aggressive, more punk. Yes, tonight\u2019s show was glitzy and fab-you-loussss, but beneath that purple-to-pink fur and those rainbow crystal earrings are layers and layers of meaning. What does it say? Post show, codesigner Beckett Fogg summed up her and her partner Piotrek Panszczyk\u2019s mission as, \u201cIt\u2019s about these dualities: How can they live not in contrast but in harmony?\u201d They riffed on contrasts of color, silhouette, era, genre, ethnicity, femininity\u2014you name it, they had a take it on it. The clash of it all made for a lively show, with guests wrestling over each other to photograph their favorite looks. It opened in mostly black and white, a basic palette for Fogg and Panszczyk to experiment with texture and treatment, like crystal-strewn cable knits that deconstruct into fringe trousers and a pied de poule\u2013inspired houndstooth that morphed into an A monogram. A \u201960s couture theme ran throughout, with several references to Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges\u2019s Spage Age shapes at his own brand and at Balenciaga. Then came the text, cut out of silver plastic as dangling belts and printed on scarves made of found phrases that evoke protest. Soon apocalypse. Power play. \u201cWe have quotes in the collection that are quite heavy, intense, almost like a protest song,\u201d began Panszczyk, \u201cbut do we really mean anything with it? Maybe not.\u201d He went on to riff that maybe the customer is actually a hippie-dippie activist, or maybe she\u2019s just wearing that Photoshop-printed tie-dye, itself a mutation of \u201960s couture polka dots, because she thinks it makes for a good selfie. Meaning can be found anywhere, but there is also an inescapable meaninglessness to our contemporary world. There\u2019s the rub. In attempting such a high-concept show, Fogg and Panszczyk became stuck, at places, in an echo chamber. Certain ideas felt so broad, like the trendy tie-dye, or so specific, like a one-off fluoro orange jumpsuit, that it was hard, as a viewer, to get one\u2019s bearings, to make sense of it all. Maybe that\u2019s the point. In its eclecticism and diversity, this collection felt like a big \u201cF you\u201d to the system, to the rules, to the right way of doing things. For a while in the recent past, Area listened to what other people wanted. This show was pure, unfiltered Fogg and Panszczyk, administered intravenously while Madonna sung \u201cShanti\u201d over a sound system on a Wall Street promenade. It was so surprisingly, sophisticatedly weird, you just had to smile."}, {"Designer": "Arthur Arbesser", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cIt\u2019s my life!\u201d said Arthur Arbesser before this show. True enough, the collection was packed with observational references to his workplace, his neighborhood, his back catalog, and even his own wardrobe. \u201cMy studio is in Piazza Sant\u2019Ambrogio\u2014a very bourgeois, conservative neighborhood where ladies tend to wear their Casentino coats or loden.\u201d Here, a nubbly piled Casentino came in almost-black brown and was worn with black-piped, rib-knit blue pants, belted loosely, and a high-collared harlequin-check sweater. There was also a milky, almost-white Casentino paired with wonderfully vibrant egg-yolk yellow pants. The lovely loden\u2014made by a father-and-son operation in the Tyrol\u2014was worn over a double-collared shirtdress in the same arresting yellow. Arbesser looked at an abacus he keeps in his studio for a print used on shirting, and he was inspired by the tiles in his restroom to make pleated check skirts and shirts, plus mohair tank tops and scarves. The pomegranate and lychee prints arranged artfully throughout this collection were designs reprised from his very first. There also seemed to be a gentle whisper of his side hustle with Fay in the quilted, drawstring jackets. A dark lychee-print suit was an adaptation of his own tuxedo, and, he said, one cut of pants\u2014I guess the ones worn below double-collared workwear jackets\u2014were adaptations of the pair he wore as a 15-year-old Boy Scout. (Sadly, no images of Arbesser in his scout kit were on the mood board.) As well as including places, things, and designs drawn from his own personal experience, Arbesser cast three of his friends and clients as models for the collection. This collection was authentically Arthur Arbesser down to the very last stitch."}, {"Designer": "ASAI", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "In a relatively short space of time, A Sai Ta has gained a cult following of global fashion obsessives. Even if you don\u2019t recognize the name, you\u2019ve probably seen the designer\u2019s wildly popular tie-dye tops and figure-hugging dresses come through your Instagram feed. With his first solo show at London Fashion Week today, the Fashion East alum proved that he can hold his own. Ta\u2019s Asai label has quickly become known for its kaleidoscopic palette, though there was nothing hippie-dippie about the new collection. Titled \u201cGround Up,\u201d it was defined by earth tones and soft neutrals, which were recurring themes across the pond in New York as well. The larger narrative for the collection, however, started with a question that\u2019s more pressing on these shores than ever: What does it mean to be British now? The initial spark of inspiration started with the work of August Sander, whose early-20th-century photographs of continental European life were the subject of an exhibition in London last summer. A picture of the famed British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel was pinned to his mood board, too. Up until now, the British designer has drawn on references from his Asian heritage\u2014his mother is originally from Vietnam, his father from China. This time around he sought to rethink traditional English codes through his own lens instead, projecting them into a dystopian future. The textiles of the landed gentry\u2014houndstooth, tattersall, and Prince of Wales check\u2014formed the basis of the collection. Still, there was a disheveled edge to the clothes that felt modern. Consider the smart brown loden wool with paint-splattered patch pockets that opened the show; or the slouchy cream corduroy pants tied with string at the waist. With models gliding down the runway in cozy knit moccasins and jester hats, the overall mood was far from spiffy or uptight. Backstage after the show, Ta spoke of a desire for protection and comfort in uncertain times. With a no-deal Brexit on the horizon, he has reason to feel unsettled, and the padded sleeping bag-style coats and drawstring cocoon jackets were a fitting response. For a brand that has risen to popularity on the wave of instantly gratifying layering pieces, the range of impressive tailoring and outerwear was an unexpected and pleasant surprise. Still, that\u2019s not to say those dipped-dyed pick-me-ups were forgotten altogether. Of the mottled brown and white nylon pieces, the turtleneck sweaters and dresses patch-worked with cable knit were a terrific update on his light and summery signature. The hand-spun cobweb sweaters, too, brought a pleasing freeform energy to the show, a nice counterpoint to the more rigorous tailoring. Twisted British classics like these bode well for the brand\u2019s future."}, {"Designer": "Ashish", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Poor Ashish Gupta had a nasty case of the flu and was at home, his delirium heightened by the British over-the-counter flu medication Night Nurse, when he decided to build a collection based on the crocheted blanket knit by his grandmother that he was wrapped up in. That fevered inspiration led to a lineup that did indeed contain a powerful dose of crochet, none of which was either knit or contained any wool. Every panel on every garment was made up of hundreds of painstakingly applied sequins. Thanks to the spotlights, you could see that close up, as the models walked by. And thanks to the sonorous but not overloud live gong soundtrack, you could hear the clothes rattling as they moved. Beyond the crochet, the aesthetic shifted between shiny grunge (slouchy knits in tinsel-toned stripes, mom jeans with scarlet sequined embellishments) and shiny uptown (a Chanel-channeling skirtsuit in a metallic green and red complete with pussy bow and pearls, huge gold goddess gowns). The shoes, by Central Saint Martins student Gui Rosa, were fantastic: traditional slingbacks, sandals, and booties that were grafted onto panels of knit. The color stories were very beautiful\u2014a sequined lavender slip dress over a scarlet underlayer was particularly punchy. Following several seasons of statement Ashish shows, this one had nothing to declare but the clothes.

Neither statement was mutually exclusive\u2014not at all\u2014especially at a time when penis power has been so badly repped by the owners of penises. The sexuality in this collection was not tilted toward the male viewer, but the woman who is viewed and doesn\u2019t care what the viewer thinks. She was herself in her chisel-toe Jimmy Choo flats and shearling bags mixed with dressed-in-the-dark, properly nasty color stories and Sunday-morning-bodega-run fleeces worn over from-last-night party dresses. The punk trousers and kilts were a sweet throwback to the 20th century, when things were so analog and simple. Cat-relief mohair knits were a warning\u2014or an embrace\u2014of spinster-dom. Speaking as a simple, stupid, moronic man, there was some sexy stuff\u2014the tiered silver dress, the tie-dye vest dress with a cry for \u201csex\u201d printed on its back\u2014but my eye wasn\u2019t the audience Williams was hoping to fluff.

He reserved a spacious-for-Manhattan-size room, cranked up the heat, and decorated with his Fall 2019 collection for Assembly. A long dress was laid out on the bed, a skirt and jacket placed neatly on the floor, a pair of pants slung over the edge of the bathtub. The idea was to showcase his new wares in an intimate, inviting space: just him, the reviewer, and the clothes. Armas had spent the last few months building a house in Los Angeles, and throughout the process, he kept thinking about the joys of privacy. What if we didn\u2019t share every single moment of our lives and every possession we own on social media? What if it was all kept quiet and tucked away? Would we be able to focus on and find satisfaction in the finer details of things? For a niche label like Assembly, this way of thinking and questioning makes a lot of sense. Armas doesn\u2019t necessarily need a highly produced presentation or fashion show. His clothing is often straightforward, with precise and beautiful tailoring and playful details that set it apart from other minimally minded lines. This season, Armas tampered with his garments by, for example, splashing white paint on a sharp leather trench coat and bleaching the edges of a cool paisley-print corduroy suit. He spray-painted one panel of a chic overcoat, made in both gray and tan, with neon green and orange. Everything was made using upcycled fabric, even the covetable \u201c\u201980s mall-print leopard\u201d dress, as he referred to it. In that hotel room today, Armas was able to show off Assembly in the most personal way possible. It was an up-close experience, and it felt thoughtful. A little bit of quiet in the fashion storm made his clothes look all the more appealing."}, {"Designer": "Atlein", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Backstage at the Fall 2019 Atlein show, it became apparent that all was not as it seemed. How about that molded and draped black leather, impeccably worked into a swaggering biker jacket atop a spangled emerald green jersey skirt, or a killer dress, the material deliciously caressing its way around the body? Ah, wrong. The \u201cleather\u201d is actually, designer Antonin Tron explained, a coated jersey he has worked on, created by \u201can indigo induction,\u201d as he called it, \u201ca bit like a denim treatment.\u201d The muted florals that gleamed from short sequin jersey dresses? Well, nearly right. It\u2019s actually a print that blends camouflage, an animal pattern of indistinct origin, and yes, blooms. But perhaps the biggest\u2014certainly the most unexpected\u2014reveal of all: Tron is a goth. Who knew? The collection, its staging, and the very starting point of thinking about what he wanted to say this coming Fall came from going to a Bauhaus gig at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in November last year; his love of the group only superseded by his fandom for the Sisters of Mercy, another shadowy intense band. \u201cI know I don\u2019t look like it,\u201d Tron said, grinning, the very picture of a clean-cut, athletic man, \u201cbut my heart is black velvet.\u201d And right on cue, there was indeed a gorgeous and considered use of this soft and pliable fabric, particularly in an abbreviated dress, its light-soaking qualities creating the subtlest ripples on the body. However, truth be told, the one quibble with going so Bauhausian with the presentation\u2019s moody lighting was that it didn\u2019t always make it easy to appreciate his very good work. But then, peering through the gloom has been the story of Paris, as much as big shoulders and stomping ankle boots. Ultimately, though, Tron\u2019s Atlein is about seeing what you get. Since he started a few years back, he has pushed himself to explore and experiment with the jersey that defines the label. (No wonder then that heroines like Madame Gr\u00e8s and Jean Muir were his aesthetic mentors when he was thinking about this collection particularly, and Atlein generally.) And if Tron likes his music loud, then there\u2019s a quietness to what he does that should be appreciated in an era when fashion\u2019s volume has been turned up to a disconcerting, ear-splitting level. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure because of that,\u201d he said, \u201cbut my idea of radical is not to go overboard; I want to keep the focus on what we do and how we make it.\u201d By which he means working with small French factories or using deadstock fabrics, a sustainability practice he has been committed to ever since he launched Atlein, and which he has never discussed before. Perhaps he should, to appreciate the better what he does, because while Tron may love goth, he also knows plenty about soul."}, {"Designer": "Awaveawake", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Jaclyn Hodes has just returned to New York from Topanga Canyon, where she had gone to live the California dream a few years ago. It was a pilgrimage the designer felt destined to make since 2011, when she began practicing Kundalini yoga. \u201cI had done yoga for 10 years before that, but Kundalini was the full fantasy lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to dress, a way to be.\u201d Though the reality of that fantasy left something to be desired (hence her return to the East Coast), it gave Hodes a better understanding of herself and her seven-year-old brand. Her translation of yogic principles is best illustrated by the nonrestrictive drape of her signature bias-cut silk slips, which are colored with 100 percent natural plant dyes by a Bali-based artist. Unlike the wave of independent home dyers, who use avocado pits and crushed petals to deliver a delicate tint, Hodes\u2019s pieces are richly pigmented by locally harvested material. \u201cThey\u2019re literally machete-ing the mango leaf, pulverizing it, and putting it in a vat,\u201d she said. Those pulverized greens render a rich mustard-seed yellow, which Hodes used throughout her new collection. Other hues were culled from the colors she encountered at different times of day to create \u201can almost blurred vision of the Topanga scenery.\u201d The deep turquoise, for instance, was a blend of indigo and mango leaf that recalled sea and sky, while the bordeaux-color backless dress came from crushed sappan bark on silk. Awaveawake iterates on the same silhouettes each season\u2014the slip, the loose pant, the robe, the cape\u2014which can get a little predictable. Hodes\u2019s strength lies in her application of color theory to add a therapeutic layer to these basic shapes, such as the soothing effect of a pale pink or the grounding energy of a deep red.

Together, the two celebrities represent what Mark Badgley and James Mischka do best: Shannon in a professional azure sheath and Bensimon in a flirty purple frock suited for partying. Having celebrated 30 years in business last season, the designers are not trying to look back, however. For fall, they pushed forward with a vision colored by restrained glamour inspired by the optimism of the 1940s and \u201950s. Their palette of chromes and forest greens was drawn from vintage Mercedes-Benz sports cars, lending a shimmer to the opening suit or dampening the drama on a column gown. The best pieces were Badgley and Mischka\u2019s simplest ones: a dark navy evening dress evoked the aerodynamics of a coupe, while a burgundy dress with sapphire embellishment and bow detail provided a classy bit of romanticism. Does a woman want a gray blazer with feather trim, sparkling trousers, or baby pink moir\u00e9 bows? Maybe the showgirls in the front row would, but clothes for the Instagram shot are not as worthy as the refined beauty for which Badgley and Mischka are renowned.

Gvasalia said he\u2019s continued to apply and refine the molded, computer-manipulated techniques he\u2019s brought into the house for the past year, \u201cbut now they\u2019re more subtle, I would say.

A dazzling white vista of jagged perfection\u2014with Switzerland\u2019s glorious incisors at its heart\u2014these mountains are the ultimate cosmic Hollywood smile. This Bally collection looked back to a 1955 logo of an Alpine peak to take inspiration for the zigzag motif that ran through shoes, clothing, and accessories. It was there on the peppily colored Alpinist-inspired technicalwear for men and women that often came accented with the rustic: edelweiss-embroidered lace, crocheted detailing, Swiss crosses, the Schweizerische Herzstiftung, vintage map prints, and faux-naif pixelated-in-knit illustrations of jolly skiers. It was there in the fringing on some iterations of the house\u2019s new semicircle Harriet bag, designed to be worn cross-body.

Apparently, Bally\u2019s ratio of womenswear revenue to men\u2019s has tilted from 1:4 to 2:3 in the past four years, and there was ammunition here to push that balance further toward parity in the vintage Everest motif sweaters, the cowled colored shearlings, and the mountain flower jacquard piuminos. And yet there was an avalanche of awesome in the menswear, too: A track-cut pair of olive green pants in outrageously thin leather and various primary-colored ski jackets in the same material had especially covetable momentum. Some of the retro logos and quirky colorways on show did whisper of a passing diversion to Patagonia.

These thousands of studs\u2014on the striking opening oversize black boucl\u00e9 blazer, on origami-structured pagoda-roof skirts, on open-shoulder bikers, on slides, on vests, on newsboy caps, on bags, on sharp-toed boots, and on transparent trenches and jackets\u2014were there to make a point. Alongside many other decorative dichotomies, they represented one side of the theme Olivier Rousteing said he was exploring in his articulation of the Balmain woman today: \u201cShe\u2019s got attitude; she is a troublemaker, and she doesn\u2019t care. She\u2019s defiant, but she is a paradox: She can be sweet and romantic too; she can be an angel . . . or she can be a devil. She cannot be categorized.\u201d Rousteing has long rebelled against those inclined to categorize him, so this collection spoke directly to his preoccupation with the expression of self-determination through clothes\u2014whatever the hell anybody watching thinks about it.

Another \u201cgood\u201d vs. \u201cbad\u201d or \u201csoft\u201d vs. \u201chard\u201d dichotomy mined with abandon by Rousteing saw the codes of an uptown bourgeois Parisienne\u2014with her fragranced wardrobe stuffed with hand-me-down couture boucl\u00e9 and evening dresses in dramatically ruffled \u201980s shapes\u2014smashed against a punky, rock-y, leave-your-clothes-on-the-floor, highly anarchic (albeit highly solvent) sensibility articulated in those bikers as well as apparently picked-apart boucl\u00e9 on denim outerwear, chainlink Alice bands, and long, embellished, frayed fishnet dresses in mohair (some of which snagged challengingly on the chain-link heels of Rousteing\u2019s spiked boots). Yet another dichotomy was encapsulated in a recurring silhouette that was a sort of born-to-be-bad baguette: fitted\u2014but full and frilled\u2014at the chest and hip; the filling was a cinched and corseted section at the abdomen. This recipe was adapted into variations that included black ruffled organza (plus cape) surrounding PVC-sheathed denim; white ruffled organza (accented with black PVC thigh highs and opera gloves) surrounding a transparent PVC; and a shoulder piece of layered black PVC petals above a black ruffled PVC skirt bisected by more transparent PVC. Side stories include menswear codes colonized by the ostentatiously feminine (at least according to traditional categorizations) and a soundtrack that segued from \u201cSweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\u201d by the Eurythmics, to \u201cForever Young\u201d and \u201cBig in Japan\u201d by Alphaville, to \u201cIt\u2019s a Sin\u201d by the Pet Shop Boys, and finally back to \u201cHere Comes the Rain Again\u201d by the Eurythmics.

If last season was about inching away from the label\u2019s luxury basics origins, this season is about jumping full steam ahead into something more dressed up, more sophisticated, and more appealing to adult women who want to party in something other than tight little minidresses and skimpy \u201990s-inspired slips. Speaking of decades gone by, Allende really dove into her own knowledge of runway history (she was a fashion journalist before Bande Noir), culling inspiration from the figure-hugging forms of Thierry Mugler, the primary colored pieces of Claude Montana, and the bold prints of Emanuel Ungaro. What was appealing about this nostalgia-laced collection was that it didn\u2019t feel like the nostalgia-laced collections nearly every other designer in the contemporary market has been doing for the last two or three seasons. Meaning, it wasn\u2019t overt or kitschy. The corseted white jacket with a peplum waist looked modern, not like old Mugler. The Ungaro-esque hot pink and green number felt right for this moment, when flowing, printed frocks are everywhere. Also of note were a loose-fitting white-sequined, long-sleeved dress styled with a belt, and a pink lam\u00e9 jumpsuit. The jumpsuit, which could have gone the way of obvious \u201980s excess, was one of the most visible examples of Allende\u2019s success at bringing a feeling of freshness to the tiresome nostalgia vibe.

It doesn\u2019t come in the form of ruffles or flou, but in a cinching of the waist to create a stark X silhouette. The definition works wonders, leaving Bassike\u2019s sometimes ascetic shapes behind in favor of one with a more mass appeal. Pants, as always, are the starting point for Sams. Now they are made with D-ring belts and pleat fronts to accentuate the waistline. On top, Sams has developed ample shirting and tunics to layer to the wearer\u2019s preferred level of slouchiness. Knitwear is made in a vertically integrated Mongolian factory, giving that half-gray, half-ivory turtleneck a sustainable backstory. In the lookbook, pieces are styled out like a puzzle, shirts tucked just so, hands nonchalantly stuffed into pockets to create a continuity with Bassike\u2019s earlier silhouettes.

The patron saint of sweet-but-lethal dressing loaned lyrics from some of Hole\u2019s hits for models to read aloud at Hay\u2019s Fall 2019 presentation before descending a spiral staircase in her West Broadway pop-up. Love also scrawled, in red marker, the lyrics for \u201cGood Sister/Bad Sister\u201d on Esther McGregor\u2019s finale look, a bridal maxi dress inspired by one Love almost wore to the altar. The performative aspect of it all\u2014seamstresses buzzing away on Singer sewing machines; models seriously reading lyrics, and then crumpling up and tossing away their papers; ambient live music playing in the background\u2014made for a transporting experience. The snow was gone, the day was gone; there was only this coming together of the female spirit. If the presentation raised the bar, the clothes rose to match. Hay has been slowly expanding her repertoire, introducing separates, bags, and even pants in recent seasons. For Fall she introduced a collaboration with Holly Hobbie on \u201980s-inspired fabrics, as well as new shapes like a drop-waist ruffle dress and a velvet coat in rich emerald. Shoes in Day-Glo colors with a Victorian inflection were made in collaboration with Irene Chung. Hay\u2019s kookiness might be her calling card, but an orange moire dress with crystal buttons was downright essential. Worn with a floral headpiece by Dennis Lanni, that look had a timeless, ethereal feel. For a designer once deemed too niche, too specific to ever make it, Hay has proven that her nostalgic pieces have broad appeal. You could see it in the range of women on the runway today, from Christina Ricci to Veronica Webb, and in the many diverse customers that crowded into Hay\u2019s pop-up by the hour. Could it be that, in the face of #MeToo and society\u2019s ongoing misogyny, we are longing for the childlike innocence and girlish beauty that a Batsheva dress promises?

Contrast is at the heart of their label, Beaufille, which means \u201chandsome girl\u201d in French; there\u2019s always something a little masculine and a little feminine. As the label has grown, that trope has gotten a little subtler and more nuanced; rather than taking inspiration from, say, a men\u2019s suit, the designers are iterating on their own curvy blazers and best-selling flared trousers. At this point, tailoring has become such a cornerstone of women\u2019s wardrobes\u2014and the idea of \u201cgendered\u201d clothing has become so old-school\u2014that it doesn\u2019t feel relevant to call it \u201cmenswear-inspired\u201d or \u201cborrowed from the boys.\u201d Instead, the Gordons have let their own style trickle into the collections: Chlo\u00e9 pointed out two A-line coats\u2014one in an amber zebra jacquard, the other in black satin\u2014and indicated which was her favorite and which was Parris\u2019s. Despite their different personal tastes, they operate on the same wavelength. Parris, who designs their jewelry line, said she was nervous that her asymmetric flower earrings and rhinestone hoops wouldn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d with Chloe\u2019s fabrics, but they turned out to be the ideal complement. As for the fabrics, there were familiar, sculptural materials like bonded satin and spongy jacquard alongside a new, almost translucent floral lace. A deep-V lace slip dress looked almost jarringly delicate next to those heavier materials, and will feel genuinely new to the girl who already has a few of Beaufille\u2019s neoprene sweatshirts and midi skirts. It\u2019s a blessing and a curse that designers are tasked with creating newness all year round; on one hand, it can sap creativity, but on the other, you can\u2019t expect women to buy the same things over and over. The Gordons are moving away from designing pre-collections in between the \u201cmain\u201d seasons so they can focus on making interesting, investment-worthy clothes with longevity. Fall\u2019s arty zebra-striped dress and the aforementioned coats were easy winners\u2014they were cool, yet relatively timeless\u2014while the cream \u201csweatshirt dress\u201d was a less-likely staple.

Backstage before the show, speaking through a translator, he said that the concept he wanted to explore in his Fall collection was that of \u201cthe Side C, the existing space between the back of the fabric and the lining, something that people don\u2019t usually perceive.\u201d Quite frankly, it seemed like such an impossible abstraction, one wondered how he would be able to translate it into actual clothes. But once the puzzling Side C concept was put aside and he let the collection do the talking, it definitely made more sense. The first look was a severe, long black cashmere coat, double-breasted and streamlined. It looked elegant in a classic, reassuring way. Then came a sleek, tailored masculine pantsuit in a dry gray wool, perfectly chic and on trend in its slightly oversize proportions. From there, the collection seemed to gently unravel: The silhouette went from elongated and restrained to fluid and almost billowy, floating freely around the body in a series of long dresses, aprons worn layered over filmy leggings or loose satin palazzo pants, and light tunics knitted in asymmetrical shapes. The play between \u201crestraint and indulgence\u201d and \u201ccovering up and revealing,\u201d as Kumakiri put it, continued in beautifully cut capes and oversize masculine city coats in checkered wools against breezy ensembles, like a flowing cape in chiffon printed with a delicate lattice floral motif. \u201cIt is inspired by the ramifications of the tiny blood vessels and veins running under our skin,\u201d said the designer. \u201cPaying attention to what\u2019s usually hidden can give birth to something new.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Bernhard Willhelm", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Bernhard Willhelm inhabits in his own time zone. This will not come as a surprise to any of the fans who appreciate his alternate-universe views. Let\u2019s be frank: Compared with the rest of Paris Fashion Week, Willhelm\u2019s showroom might as well be on another planet. This collection, in the designer\u2019s own words, is a \u201csymbolic view on consumerism and the relationship between consumers, authors of consumer innovations, and the present and future states of humanity and the world.\u201d That\u2019s a big mission. Let\u2019s just say that Steve Jobs plays a role in it (\u201ca collection has to look very good on an iPhone\u201d). Willhelm is reaching out to the highly educated consumer, top of that list being the Japanese. America comes in on the opposite end of the spectrum, because, like so many these days, Willhelm is feeling both fascinated and conflicted. A lot of his clients come from the Silicon Valley new economy, where the idea of an office hasn\u2019t existed since Sex and the City, as the designer observes. You get where he\u2019s going. His base dresses for comfort. Some of them have given up on the city entirely and have headed back to nature, which is where unisex dressing might come in particularly handy. So, the designer just sticks to some of his favorite things, like basketball. Willhelm has just returned to Paris from a couple of months in Venice Beach, California. The Veniceball basketball team stars in the lookbook, where the handsome French player Nick Ansom gets a special callout. So does the Brazilian-Austrian artist Christian Rosa, another Los Angeles transplant, who lent his studio for this shoot. That the wall is IKEA blue is hardly incidental. This is when Timothy Leary\u2019s The Psychedelic Experience comes in. A scan through the collection notes delivers this: \u201cDesign nowadays merely functions as a composition element, it\u2019s minimal and reduced to the MAX. Sportwear is in a big moment of transition, it\u2019s . . . worn by both sexes. Worn out, bleached, overdyed and dip-dyed in blood red. Like stonewashed Chanel. Trippy in Pink.\u201d Never mind the pink; the khakis are better. Willhelm situates his particular time zone somewhere between Chicago and Antwerp. There, in addition to Steve Jobs on a sweatshirt, one finds camouflage, kimono-style knitwear, a bizarre decapitated head on a marble plate, fil coupe appliqu\u00e9 spelling out Consumer, a Don\u2019t Mess With Texas T-shirt, pretty cool leaping panther embroideries, and a quartet of really cute kittens. The sock shoes from Camper will probably go cult, too. \u201cIn the best case, we wear what we design without being too precious about it,\u201d the designer opines, citing another German designer who spent a lifetime working in Paris. Let\u2019s not go overboard here. Oh, but wait: The Willhelm customer already is."}, {"Designer": "Bevza", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Fashion week in New York has become a bit like the Wild West.

Svitlana Bevza\u2019s presentation qualified. Once guests sat themselves, some with glasses of Champagne in hand, the lights dimmed, the first model stepped out, and then came a voice from beyond. The show was narrated by director and stylist Pam Nasr, who stood on a small corner stage with a microphone in her hand. Models walked slowly, one by one, and Nasr spoke in a dramatic, borderline sarcastic tone: \u201cHere, Alla wears an outfit that is the refined essence of Bevza. This fabulous white tailored coat comes with a matching pair of square-toe mules. Chic and sophisticated.\u201d Other times she declared, \u201cSee that cinch!\u201d or \u201cDo a beautiful spin for us, Masha!\u201d It was cheeky and clever, like being time-warped back into some long-lost age of runway shows. Nasr\u2019s narration, funny as it was, also helped to emphasize Bevza\u2019s skills as a designer. The minimal collection was in part inspired by her hometown of Kiev, as seen in a floral print of a photo the designer took at its National Botanic Garden. Bevza brought back her puffer coats and \u201990s-ish white dresses, styled this time around with leg warmers that referenced a gymnastics show the designer used to watch on a Ukrainian morning TV as a kid.

Admittedly, there\u2019s a bit of a disconnect between the \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d label right now, underlined by the fact that it recently changed its name from Baldwin to BLDWN (and relocated from Kansas City to Los Angeles). Johnathan Crocker came on board as president last year and was tasked with elevating the offering and introducing bona fide ready-to-wear. Right now, BLDWN\u2019s Nolita shop is mostly stocked with jeans and cashmere sweaters, but within the next few months, the Spring collection\u2014the first under Crocker\u2019s purview\u2014will land on shelves and close the loop. Spring was a big step forward, but Fall 2019 felt like a greater departure. Last season\u2019s color-blocked novelty jeans, for instance, were replaced by dark-rinse, gently flared denim trousers. Grown-up jeans, essentially. The full-length, straight-leg jeans in classic blue and ivory looked polished, too, styled with no-frills poplin button-downs and turtlenecks. Women\u2019s design director Shayla Guy mentioned Nico as a reference, explaining that she wanted the clothes to feel feminine but not girly, and strong but not masculine. What do you call that? Let\u2019s say it\u2019s casual, yet composed. There was nothing \u201cborrowed from the boys\u201d about the cayenne trousers, floor-length poplin shirtdress, or houndstooth-printed jeans. Crocker is a denim-industry veteran and noticed a void in the market for those kinds of considered, luxurious everyday pieces at a \u201ccontemporary\u201d price point\u2014i.e., somewhere between Everlane and The Row.

Backstage before the show, Signora Anna Molinari, the petite dynamo who founded the company in 1977 with her late husband, Gianpaolo Tarabini, sounded upbeat and optimistic and fully involved in getting her beloved label back on track. \u201cThis collection is my Blumarine: There\u2019s everything I\u2019ve always liked,\u201d she enthused. So out came short, black, taffeta-ruffled pannier skirts topped by fitted, cropped, leopard-print jackets; delightful black velvet minidresses with feathered bustiers or asymmetrical white Chantilly-lace-and-chiffon cocktail frocks with trailing sashes. Black varnished leather added a touch of louche glamour, while the signature Blumarine red roses were printed on tiered taffeta ballerina dresses or embroidered on glittering evening numbers. It certainly wasn\u2019t something that will change the future of fashion, but it felt fresh and well-edited, with a spirited allure appealing to a young audience. The lesson for designers and labels alike here is this: Do not blindly court fleeting trends just hoping to win over zillions of Instagram followers.

The brand has its name recognition, heritage, and quality going for it, but lots of designers are coming for Boss\u2019s market share. Some of them are making \u00fcber-luxe hand-stitched suits that hark back to the earliest days of men\u2019s tailoring. Other designers are deconstructing, reassembling, and exploding the proportions of their suits with no regard for tradition whatsoever. Boss\u2019s suits are somewhere in between: a mix of classic silhouettes, luxe materials, and interesting, of-the-moment tweaks. Backstage after his Fall 2019 show, chief brand officer Ingo Wilts explained his \u201ccurated\u201d approach to the men\u2019s and women\u2019s collections. He was inspired by actual art curators and the New Yorkers who frequent their galleries on Thursday nights. They\u2019re not wearing hoodies and jeans; they\u2019re dressed up, but still feel relaxed. They\u2019re into arty touches and would appreciate Wilts\u2019s two-tone trousers, patchwork shearlings, color-blocked knits, and sturdy boots. More broadly, he said he wanted everything to simply feel soft. There were new cocoon-like silhouettes, both for men and women\u2014see: the men\u2019s long quilted ivory puffer and the women\u2019s voluminous camel cape\u2014and the suits on each side were just barely loosened up. One women\u2019s suit combined a long, gently oversize navy blazer with ultra-slim bootcut trousers. The contrast looked good, and the look will inspire many women to wear their suits with thick-heeled boots, not stilettos. Still, Wilts\u2019s challenge each season is to show off Boss\u2019s prowess beyond tailoring. The sculptural wool dresses\u2014an extension of suiting, in a way\u2014had a cozy, polished appeal, and Sasha Pivovarova\u2019s mercurial satin finale dress looked surprisingly red carpet\u2013worthy."}, {"Designer": "Bottega Veneta", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Daniel Lee\u2019s runway debut was a long time coming; the 32-year-old C\u00e9line alum was appointed Bottega Veneta\u2019s new creative director last June. In the interim, Lee presented a Pre-Fall collection in the company\u2019s Milan headquarters that indicated he was well acquainted with the Bottega DNA\u2014it\u2019s a leather specialist with a proprietary intrecciato weave\u2014and that he\u2019s not afraid to blow it up. Literally. Along with a distinctive square-toe pump and boot, the maxi intreccio totes were the pre-collection\u2019s big takeaway: distinctive and identifiable without resorting to logo branding. The house motto of old was \u201cwhen your own initials are enough.\u201d At today\u2019s show, held in a clear tent with the sun blazing, the benches were decorated with leather cushions in that maxi intreccio pattern. They\u2019re a useful signifier for Lee\u2019s approach to his first big gig: He respects the house\u2019s heritage, but he\u2019s got an independent streak. The designer wasn\u2019t doing interviews today, but at the Pre-Fall appointment, he said, \u201cI like real clothes. I think there\u2019s a need for a return to elegance and sophistication.\u201d This collection was far bolder than that statement suggests. For the Philophiles wondering, it wasn\u2019t a straight-up C\u00e9line redux either. The show started with a black leather tank dress cut with a simplicity that belied the experimentation that would come later. Lee worked leather in all sorts of ways: quilting it into a slim puffer coat with a chain belt, laser-cutting it into small squares linked loosely together on skirts and more tightly on outerwear, and bonding it (apparently) with neoprene to create the look of motocross gear. The biker leather was more believable on the men. Knitwear was a big part of Lee\u2019s vision for both genders, and it produced the collection\u2019s most desirable pieces: subtly sexy sweater dresses with cutaway clavicle-exposing necklines, and another double-layer dress in black and white of twisting, complicated construction that nonetheless looked like it will be easy to wear. A scoop-neck sweater had a substantial gold chain built in. The guys got clingy, asymmetrical, double-layered knits of their own. They\u2019re not a conservative, bourgeois proposition. Neither was Lee\u2019s tailoring. His women\u2019s jackets were cut with a raised collar, which created a strongly sloping shoulder line, or, more compellingly, they were lapel-less with gold hardware at the neckline that created a graceful cut-out framed with leather. For the men, there were narrow, almost two-dimensional sleeves that extended well past the wrists and a pronounced shoulder line that put Martin Margiela in mind. Most of this marched out on sturdy lug sole boots\u2014real stompers. A lot of what was on the runway was directional enough to challenge the eye, or at least to challenge what we expect from Bottega Veneta. This was an ambitious debut, full of risks. We don\u2019t get a lot of those these days.

The silhouettes were retightened-up alongside the palette: The emphasis here was on lean, monochromatic wasp-waist looks, with lots of pencil shapes and beautifully tailored bootleg trousers. There were some sporty gestures\u2014anoraks and tops shaped like racing tanks, for instance, and Maxwell loosened up his silhouette for evening, showing a swishy palazzo pant and long-sleeved blouse ensemble in peridot satin and a few bouffant gowns and formal skirts. But overall, the collection hewed to a mood of constriction. As Maxwell explained after the show, he\u2019s been dealing with an illness in the family, and the experience made him want to create clothes that felt a bit protective and armor-like. You could sense that desire in his trim puffer jackets, the cape attachment on certain sleeves, and the funnel necks adorning many of his tops. But mostly that protective spirit came through in Maxwell\u2019s hewing to terra firma, sticking to immaculate, classic looks with easy retail appeal.

Even their boldest pieces are done with restraint, and Hout and Cramer have a keen eye for fit. On paper, a corduroy jumpsuit sounds like a disaster, but theirs was light (not bulky!), super soft, and spliced with waist-whittling elastic. The patch-pocket corduroy pants were surprisingly flattering, too; in fact, pants and jumpsuits in general are a big business for Apiece Apart. They can\u2019t keep their pin-tucked denim overalls in stock, so they reintroduced them here in a bright \u201970s wash.

On that luxe note, Hout and Cramer also introduced a leather trench with a rounded collar, blouson sleeves, and a self-tie belt; superfans, start saving now. The shearling coats looked good, too, particularly the one in dusty lavender, but women who don\u2019t wear real leather or skins should bookmark the glossy faux-fur bomber jacket.

Perhaps it\u2019s that he\u2019s grown comfortable at the helm of Brooks or that sales are on the rise yet again, but Posen is tackling the trappings of British prepsterdom this season, from riding jackets to sharp plaids. The English wit fits nicely within the Brooks look, allowing for Posen to build out a blazer group in tartans and to dare to cut a tux in velvet tartan. He\u2019s leaning in to the richness of it all with a specially treated Loro Piana camel cashmere coat and a sequin minidress in graduated shades of blue. It\u2019s proper enough, with prim blouses and a Fair Isle cardigan, but still thoroughly modern thanks to Posen\u2019s feminine tailoring on sheath dresses and draped cashmere coats.

Tisci\u2019s affinity for streetwear is well known from his work at Givenchy. His viewpoint on British street style is filtered through his nostalgia for his experiences as an Italian fashion student at Central Saint Martins in the edgy heyday of \u201990s music and club culture\u2014but London now is a very different, and he thinks, \u201cless free\u201d place. \u201cI observe a lot, now I am living here,\u201d he said.

There were Vivienne Westwood\u2013like corseted tops (she\u2019s a heroine he\u2019s already collaborated with) pulled on over a polo shirt, a stretch cycling dress, or tracksuit bottoms. Some of the boys\u2019 bomber jackets and the girls\u2019 dresses and coats were embedded with what looked like beer-bottle tops.

There were upside-down attachments of padded jackets on tweed suits and camel Crombies\u2014a chopped-up knack John Galliano brought to fashion back in the day. And was that a reverb of Oasis-versus-Blur Brit-pop style, when Tisci sent out a lad wearing a Union Jack flag billowing from the back of his black puffer coat? The bourgeoisie half of the show read more as a pitch for the international elites of the world. The British aristocracy doesn\u2019t really dress in spick-and-span skirt suits and neatly coordinated men\u2019s tailoring. The truly posh stick to their more reserved inherited country-house modes of class distinction, although a black velvet skirt suit with a cream ruffled blouse and silk tie might win young royal favor at some point. It\u2019s a tense time in the U.K., and though Tisci ducked the inevitable backstage question about his position on Brexit with a noncommittal \u201cEveryone has a different opinion,\u201d there was an edgy atmosphere embedded in his presentation setup. Unbeknownst to the audience, Tisci had arranged it that half of the attendees had a very different experience of the show from the other. One of the presentation spaces in The Tanks at Tate Modern was a brutalist interior which was caged with steel scaffolding, over which dozens of kids, clad in generic tracksuits, shorts, and hoodies climbed and hung out as the show went on. The other half of the audience observed the show in a wood-clad auditorium with comfortable cream-cushioned seats with something akin to a luxury private cinema.

The designers didn\u2019t calculate the exact geometry in their wares this season, but instead, they were inspired by, in Freeman-Topper\u2019s words, \u201cThe genius and simplicity that nature brings. The occurrence of the Golden Ratio emphasizes that there is something so much greater than us, beyond the mind of man.\u201d Freeman-Topper and Freeman did a fine job translating this idea into Camilla and Marc this season. The collection was as sophisticated and refined as it\u2019s ever been, with sculptural tailoring on suiting and blazers, as well as corseted shirting, and a very striking strapless georgette column gown with contour-stitch detailing. A mustard yellow PVC trench and matching skirt were also of note for their texture and bold color, as was a metallic one-shoulder minidress. The Camilla and Marc brand is continuing on a path of growth, and this season they really stepped it up in terms of attention to quality and detail. The collection was precise and well executed without feeling too forced or overdone. In fashion, that\u2019s exactly the right equation for success."}, {"Designer": "Carmen March", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Although she\u2019s rightfully and understandably passionate about her Spanish roots, Carmen March tried to rein in all that emotion for Fall (somewhat), with varying results. Overall, a more relaxed look suits her. In lieu of skintight matador pants and boleros of past seasons, the designer is now looking into mixing her self-confessed love of skin and transparency with a looser, more languid vibe. By her own admission, she spent an insane amount of time zeroing in on \u201cthe perfect nude\u201d for coats and separates (those bandeaus are big with her core customers). Then she filled out the collection with luxurious materials such as men\u2019s suiting fabrics, butter-soft Spanish leather worked into a puffer jacket, and plush hand-knits. A leopard can never really change its spots, however. March has a thing about the 1980s, so there\u2019s more than a whiff of decadence and sensuality\u2014not to mention disco fabulousness\u2014in her bonded-rubber tulle numbers; matte fuchsia floral lace; and transparent tops showered with silver spots meant to flirt with strobe lights or candlelight, take your pick. In a more restrained vein, a black suit with wide trousers nodded to the decade of excess without tipping into \u201980s hangover. The double-breasted coats with big, fat buttons were more literal, however. \u201cThe \u201980s are always with me,\u201d the designer allows. \u201cThat was the best decade: It was fun, and there was something about how women looked wonderful that\u2019s hard to forget.\u201d She\u2019s here to ensure we don\u2019t, whether her customer actually remembers those days or simply wishes she were old enough to."}, {"Designer": "Carolina Herrera", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Wes Gordon is upending expectations at Carolina Herrera. There was once an orderly procession to this label\u2019s runway shows: chic little day suits followed by cocktail dresses, then special-occasion ball gowns. At the New York Historical Society this morning, Look 1 was a floor-length trapeze dress in a sunny yellow and azure blue floral print. Gordon said the reordering was intentional, that he wanted something bold. The billowing dress established the collection\u2019s two dominant characteristics: its vibrant, almost electric palette\u2014\u201chappy colors,\u201d he said\u2014and its roomy volumes. Together, they painted a picture of youthful, unstructured ease. That attitude was accentuated by another of the show\u2019s key silhouettes, a super-mini shift dress with swingy \u201960s-ish proportions worn over bare legs. More surprising: an oversize anorak in coral and pink tech fabric that didn\u2019t quite qualify as athleisure, but came close. Gordon has spent a lot of his time on the road this past year, he said, meeting clients in the United States and beyond. \u201cWe\u2019re speaking to a broad range of women now, because there\u2019s a casualness to it.\u201d For the longtime Herrera customer acquainted with the founder\u2019s exacting precision\u2014Mrs. Herrera was present today as perfectly coiffed as ever, wearing one of her chic little day suits and heels\u2014there were a pair of lean coats, the black version with artful draping on one lapel. Gordon repeated the motif on slim black trousers with built-in cummerbunds; the pair with the cummerbund in shocking pink was partnered with the Herrera-signature crisp white shirt. The tailoring was fine and reflective of the capabilities of the label\u2019s in-house atelier. On the evening side of things, Gordon should push himself and explore dresses with more shape and structure. Nothing heavy, but at night, a woman often likes to show off her waist.

In the run-up to the show, there was much conversation about how we would be able to distinguish the two. On reflection, in the post-show glow of two\u2014one? Okay, what does it really matter?\u2014nifty collections, we were clearly asking the wrong question. Right now, when fashion has become so branded, categorized, and readily and easily identified, a little obfuscation on origins is kind of welcome. Especially given that the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of both labels is to recycle and upcycle with existing vintage and deadstock fabrics, to go about proudly proclaiming ownership of what already exists and what has previously been seems so last century. Maybe forget the labels and just enjoy the clothes. At which point, cultural analyst and provocateur Faith Popcorn enters the picture. She delivered a pithy and witty monologue in the lecture theater that acted as a soundtrack to Peters\u2019s and Gabier\u2019s show, variously riffing on the end of gender duality, ownership, corporate (ir)responsibility, and how values are the new value in our lives. Coming off of a NYFW that has been seeking its heart in (sometimes) the wrong places, this all made for an experience that was uplifting in its honesty, pragmatism, and, yes, hope. The clothes were key to this. I\u2019m not going to bother figuring out (and nor should you) which label did what, but the loving and considered way that tie-dye tees were merged with an Edwardian lace nightdress or a \u201930s slip, a men\u2019s tux was collapsed into a coat, two \u201940s fake furs collided into one another, or fringing swished from tees and recut jeans made for a desirable array of real fashion, in both senses of the phrase. The standout look\u2014a \u201960s caban fused with a blanket scarf and worn with a white shirt and navy pants\u2014was modeled by Vogue\u2019s very own Tonne Goodman. Goodman has worked in the industry for quite some time, as evinced by her forthcoming book, Point of View: Four Decades of Defining Style, and her experiences have made her deeply committed to sustainability. Did she expect to be walking the runway one day in a chic array of repurposed clothes? Maybe not. But likely neither did Peters or Gabier. Once industry darlings, they\u2019ve turned to questioning, just like Goodman, exactly how they\u2014we\u2014go forward from here.

That plumage was contained and frozen in dresses that pressed lines of marabou between an outer layer of sheer jersey and an inner body of satin.

There was a girl, standing in a mirrored box that was hoisted high above the end of the runway and then slowly lowered. In the darkened space, you could guess at what it was\u2014a throwback boutique dressing room from some nonspecific time in the \u201970s or \u201980s, perhaps? The clothes fit, for sure. As she stepped out at ground level, this girl was wearing precisely what the original Celine was and had meant to every French bourgeois woman\u2014before fashion ever got its hands on it. A pleated, knee-length, divided country-checked skirt with a horse-bit belt. A white silk blouse, a printed logo scarf. A black blazer, glossy knee-length high-heeled boots. A ladylike shoulder bag on a chain. Aviator sunglasses. There have been all sorts of jokes about \u201cold Celine\u201d since Hedi Slimane took over. But in his third showing for the house, this\u2014and everything that followed\u2014was his turning of the tables. This was old, old Celine\u2014exactly the kind of politely classy merchandise originally sold under the label before LVMH acquired it, long before even Phoebe Philo\u2019s predecessor, Michael Kors, was drafted to make runway shows out of it. In our time of so much fashion, this was Slimane\u2019s moment to iterate, and reiterate, his version of French fashion from a time of nonfashion\u2014a niche of Parisian upper- and middle-class style that he must have understood from being a boy growing up in France. In a way it was exactly what Slimane has always done\u2014taking the subject of a seam of preexisting street style and drilling into it for all it\u2019s worth. If that came as a surprise\u2014this counter-counterculture turn from a designer known for his deep obsession with youth style tribes\u2014it was worked through with all the singular focus and conviction that is Slimane\u2019s known methodology. From beginning to end, it was an exercise in imprinting essentially two looks on the consciousness of his audience in the black box tent\u2014and on the world beyond. There were culottes and variations on silk ladylike dresses, or the skinny jeans, high boots, and jacket combo that simultaneously made up the other side of the bourgeois French girl\u2019s wardrobe throughout the \u201970s and \u201980s. Yet within that insistent, narrow-seeming framework, this was Slimane working as the brilliant mass communicator and merchandise magician LVMH appointed him to be. For all the women who might have been expecting more of his super-short cocktail dresses, here was an about-face and a completely new way to be, clearly broken down into its constituent elements. Where there were New Wave stilettos and biker boots, now there are horsey, classically heeled boots or over-the-knee ones with wedges. Here is a new/old cut of skinny jean brought back again. Here is a different way to wear a short bomber or a glittery jacket\u2014with a conventional country tweed divided skirt or conventional granny-style skirt to the knee. And here are the required accessories you will need: the polite old-school Celine logo shoulder bag, the horse-bit belt, and the only pair of aviator-style sunglasses you must now buy. Other designers have toyed with the theme of bourgeois this season, but this made them look like dilettantes. It was an overnight diktat of change in the way it used to happen before fashion became today\u2019s multi-choice smorgasbord. Effectively, it also put out of fashion everything that Slimane himself had started back in his days at Saint Laurent, everything that now has trickled through to fuel fast fashion. It\u2019s the uprising of the Parisian bourgeoisie\u2014a most surprising no-compromises French manifesto for these troubled times. Take it or leave it, says Hedi Slimane.

Her compatriot Min Kim came up with slick, fitted, zippered suits that also turned out to be knitted, and laminated via her own technique.

The kite dress, the coffee-table dress, the remote-control dress, the LED dress, and plenty of other groundbreaking garments feature on the CV of London\u2019s most restlessly inventive designer. This anniversary show was the climax of this season\u2019s three collection \u201cpretension\u201d series, and Chalayan\u2019s exploration of identities assumed via clothing gelled in a womenswear collection that cantered through equestrian wear and fetish with a side-saddle serving of voguing and corsetry, which was inspired by Shakespeare-era women of \u201cill repute\u201d\u2014a 16th-century melange of slut-shaming and witch-hunting. To top that off, looks 44 to 46 were designed to spell \u201cto be\u201d in Japanese: each one was accompanied by three bunraku puppeteers who effectively transformed the women wearing clothes into pieces of text. You get a lot to chew on with Chalayan, but there was plenty of highly digestible fare today. The performative aspect of his funny vogue-hands headpieces were the moments of clever comedy, but of more interest to his customers were the dresses that overlaid corsetry upon obliquely cut eveningwear in leather or fabric, which sometimes featured the D-ringed puckers of suspender straps. The precise folding and gathering in many of these pieces were reflected in the furled clutches, whose irregular shape vaguely resembled drips of candle wax. Chalayan\u2019s round-shouldered leather coat and clean-shouldered tuxedo skirt suit intercut with form-defining and posture-boosting corsets played against loose tailoring in houndstooth with accentuated jodhpur pants.

He took us to a place high in the mountains on a beautiful day. It was a snow-bound haven\u2014a slice of Chanel heaven, viewed from a distance that was poignantly difficult to bear. There was an icicle-like tinkling on the soundtrack. Models assembled, one by one, on the snow-covered steps of a faux alpine hostelry, the Chanel Gardenia. It was hard, the suppressed anticipation of what was going to happen next. What is the correct form for honoring someone at a fashion show, someone who was always so fixed on waving away vulgar sentimentality, and who always had something hilariously skewering to say about the posthumous hagiographies of anyone he cared to mention? Karl Lagerfeld was the least sentimental of people. He loved his job and always regarded it as the task of continually living in the present. He reveled in letting it be known he had a \u201ccontract for life\u201d with Chanel, which he enjoyed to the maximum moment. Well, this is how it went. There was a minute\u2019s silence. And then, Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s voiceover, from a recent Chanel podcast (this man loved every tech advancement). He spoke in French, until the last sentence, where he burst through in English about his pleasure in imagining the detonation of a surprise on an audience in, \u201cOh! It\u2019s like walking in a painting!\u201d The Chanel girls\u2014his crew, the latest generation he\u2019d encouraged and quipped with in the Chanel studio since 1983\u2014were clearly conscious of the ceremonial responsibilities they had. They trod the \u201csnow,\u201d hands in pockets, insouciantly proving what a perfectly considered collection of wide-legged trouser suits these were\u2014with long, swirlingly soft, checked tweed coats he\u2019d envisaged in tandem with his longtime right-hand Virginie Viard. That section was amazingly poised. Tailoring is a subject du jour, but through the filter of Chanel consciousness, we saw tradition, femininity, and an energetic projection of the shape of today. Let\u2019s put it down here: The opening, some of the wide, pleated trousers, was incredibly on point\u2014a flipping of the Chanel tradition of opening with tweed skirtsuits\u2014with playful snowballs of tulle and crystallized snowflakes thrown into the back of the girls\u2019 hair. What Karl Lagerfeld never forgot\u2014he was a rare intellectual pragmatist who frequently ridiculed high-concept fashion\u2014is that clothes are nothing unless they are worn. That was Coco Chanel all over, too. It should be remembered that, by the late 1970s, few cared about her legacy. Her canon had been put in the shade by Yves Saint Laurent until Karl Lagerfeld was hired into the house by the Wertheimer family in 1983. It was Lagerfeld who irreverently illuminated the codes of Chanel\u2014irradiating them in the constantly changing sidelights of the events of four decades\u2019 worth of current affairs, the serial revolutions of fax, the Internet, social, and the global reach of fashion to new generations in Asia, and beyond. He was always up for a topical gimmick and a punning accessory, but he also knew about emotional intelligence\u2014that, and his connection with nature and nuances connecting the dots of his past, came through in his last few collections. The last big break he\u2019d given his audience\u2014the sight of barefoot girls running on a Caribbean beach\u2014was superseded by this immersion in alpine sunlight. So this collection was Lagerfeld at his uplifting best. No matter how dark the days were, his ability to throw on the icing of a ruffly white organza blouse, to sparkle up embroideries with a deft hand on a Nordic sweater, or to conjure dream dresses within any theme to which his huge imagination traveled. These were the gifts he gave to fashion. Today, as always. As the models dashed away tears, and the audience stood in gratitude to applaud, the unforgettable memory of Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s elegant, frivolous mind was lifted onto the Olympus of the fashion greats."}, {"Designer": "Chlo\u00e9", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "At Chlo\u00e9 today, postcards showcasing some of Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s key collections for the house were placed on every seat as a tribute to the designer who passed away last week. On the back of each card were printed Lagerfeld\u2019s comments about his work. He was a man of many words, and he designed at Chlo\u00e9 for 25 years, but something he said about an iconic 1975 collection resonated today. \u201cThe essence of modern dressing\u2014unstructured, weightless, [and] totally feminine.\u201d Four decades later, that notion sums up the Chlo\u00e9 aesthetic just about perfectly, and Natacha Ramsay-Levi nailed it this season, with an array of the kind of breezy but polished dresses that women have looked to Chlo\u00e9 for since Karl\u2019s days. The orangish-red wrap style in a silk jacquard wallpaper pattern was extra charming with navy embroidered Cs scalloping the edge of its skirt. Its sister dresses were mostly shorter, often with asymmetrical hems and volume through the shoulders and sleeves that transmitted a\u2014yes\u2014modern kind of ease. Ramsay-Levi sent them out with mid-heel boots (her boots from last Fall are everywhere at Paris Fashion Week) that accentuated the cool attitude. There was more going on here, however, than billowy dresses. Ramsay-Levi has made attenuated, sometimes quirky tailoring part of her vocabulary since she arrived at Chlo\u00e9. Those horse-embroidered corduroys have also had a good run IRL. For Fall, her trouser silhouette was a utility-cargo-hybrid bootcut, long and lanky; in denim, she showed them with a deep cuff. A military topcoat and cropped pants were cut in a Prince of Wales crepe with a substantial hand, very Chlo\u00e9 in its \u201970s lines. The standout piece of tailoring was a navy coat with extra-large lapels and a swallowtail hem. Its back was ribbed knit, which gave it its snug fit without (presumably) making it constricting. That goes back to Lagerfeld\u2019s comments about unstructured weightlessness. On the accessories front, the talismanic jewelry weighed down more of the looks than necessary\u2014a little would\u2019ve gone a longer way\u2014and the metal-hardware logos on the bags could be considerably more discreet.

Elsewhere, Cowan expanded his daywear offerings with leather minis, perforated polo dresses, and a wearable leather dress in tangerine orange.

Some of these were quite pretty, but it didn\u2019t exactly feel like he was at ease. Wijnants has been quietly building his business for 16 years, to the point where he can now step things up a notch in terms of venue and capacity.

Hewing masculine might have been a little too far out of Wijnants\u2019s zone, inspiration-wise.

Sure, he proved he can handle a collage moment in fashion better than many, delivering cable-knit/striped/floral/color-blocked numbers that require no effort to project into real life. A woman could wear those without looking kooky. His base will probably also thrill to the hand-painted prints, particularly on a bronze overcoat.

He held out a dress punctuated with buttons and proceeded to deconstruct it, removing the sleeves and taking out the torso, so that what remained was a crop top and a skirt. Nifty stuff. Other looks, including a twisted tablecloth dress and a draped jumper, featured silhouettes that followed the body rather than flaunted it. One gets the sense that his change is incremental, which likely allows wearers to feel good about their purchases and to add to them as desired. With his 10th anniversary around the corner, Esber mentioned that sticking to \u201cquintessential pieces\u201d from season to season has presented its own challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard space to be in,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople generally want bells and whistles; that\u2019s what they read as value. But I have stuck to what I love and what I believe in, and some people have come for the ride, and some haven\u2019t.\u201d And just as the visit seemed complete, Esber offhandedly motioned over to the sandals in various heel heights and hues. They don\u2019t appear in these images, but they are a new addition to his offering. A system of knotted cords that pass between the toes makes for a unique design. Whether they are comfortable remains to be seen (or felt), but you get the sense they wouldn\u2019t have ended up in the showroom otherwise."}, {"Designer": "Christopher John Rogers", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Last season, Baton Rouge\u2013born, Brooklyn-based designer Christopher John Rogers made an auspicious debut, presenting a vibrant collection punctuated with hot pink organza ruffles and exaggerated church hats fit for a Jacquemus acolyte. Rogers\u2019s inspirations were quite fantastical, bridging the gap between a mid-century couture show, an eerily empty California beach town, and the planet Mars with clothes that brought a bit of an absurdist touch to eveningwear. In light of the fact that the majority of Rogers\u2019s contemporaries (he\u2019s the ripe old age of 25) are more inclined toward streetwear, the formal and unapologetically fun creations he set forth felt like a breath of fresh air. With his second collection, which he showed last night on Canal Street, Rogers tightened up his vision without losing any of the whimsical charm of his debut. \u201cLast season, obviously, the mission was to really have fun and show people what we were about, but this season I wanted to show growth and that we\u2019re trying to be serious contenders in New York,\u201d Rogers said amidst the buzzing crowd who braved the slush and hail to take in his playful creations. In spite of this more ambitious attitude, he hasn\u2019t lost his penchant for out-there references; this season, he says he was thinking about \u201cmid-century cotillion balls, debutantes, and quincea\u00f1eras, but as if those celebrations were thrown in a neolithic site like Stonehenge, and then Dr. Seuss drew them.\u201d Rogers deftly delivered on this ambitious undertaking. He took some of the most notable silhouettes from last season, particularly the standout hot pink taffeta number, and exaggerated them further; in that case, he offered up an even more dramatic canary-yellow version of the gown, which was comprised of cascading ruffles. He added additional structure to his creations, showing an impossibly wide sky-blue and neon green skirt and a strawberry-shaped waist on one gown, which he said was made from a difficult process of stuffing boning with tulle. The young designer is equally skilled at keeping things pared down, though, as he proved with some of the slimmer dresses this season: the hand-painted black sheath, which artist Drake Carr decorated with the visage of a laughing woman, proved a fine example of this more honed-in approach to tailoring. Carr lent his paintbrush to many of the pieces in the collection, and Rogers even converted some of Carr\u2019s portraits into a print made up of many different expressive characters. There are some mental gymnastics required in thinking about how Rogers makes these technically impressive gowns and suits. He still sews everything in his Brooklyn apartment with the help of his two roommates, and they all have full-time day jobs (Rogers is an associate designer at Diane von Furstenberg). Now that celebrities like Cardi B and SZA have started to wear his label, and especially after the reveal of this assured sophomore collection, he\u2019ll definitely need to get a proper studio soon."}, {"Designer": "Christopher Kane", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Sexuality in fashion is a Christopher Kane specialty subject. \u201cWe always do sexy in a different way from other people.

Kane said he and his sister have spent an eye-opening time researching into fetish worlds\u2014people with a sexual interest in balloons, rubber, food, liquid. A couple of the terms were spelled out as slogans: \u201cLooner\u201d and \u201cRubberist.\u201d Closer inspection showed the siblings at work channeling erotic electricity into the details in all the different, subtly suggestive, double-take ways that make up the Christopher Kane story of \u201cOh!\u201d Look twice, and look again at the crystal chains outlining necklines, at the lines of silver snaps, the deployment of slinky chainmail, the configurations of lace and the free-ranging use of latex\u2014from an entire black rubber raincoat to scarves to lapels on black tailoring, to the dark green elbow patches and cuffs on a very chic pale pink satin coat. This is the point: By Kane\u2019s fetishistic alchemy, the sleazy and the cheap are always elevated into clothes and accessories, which are inarguably chic. That goes as much for his on-point use of duchesse satin, his \u201ccupcake\u201d flounced minidresses, or the flounce on the hem of a coat as it does for the very clever way he can transform something as simple as a one-sleeved white T-shirt by implanting it with a single line of crystals.

The tropical vibrancy of the city made its way onto Chromat\u2019s Fall runway, but the culture of South Florida is about more than punchy colors. Relocation gave McCharen-Tran a chance to think big away from the noise of New York, and it allowed her to consider the daily realities of global warming. \u201cWe started to design this collection thinking about the paradise fantasy of Miami, but living there made me realize it\u2019s on the climate change frontline,\u201d said McCharen-Tran post-show. \u201cFlooding, high tide, red tide\u2014which is toxic algae that can burn your skin\u2014these are everyday issues there which really made me consider how I\u2019m contributing to the devastation.\u201d The push towards a more eco-conscious sensibility has been a recurring theme this season, but the Chromat interpretation was distinctive; where else are you going to see models carting water bottles and dragging a fishnet full of plastic waste behind them? Already using recyclable materials like bio-based TPU and Lycra created from old fishing nets, McCharen-Tran decided to utilize dead stock when making Fall\u2019s lineup of bikinis and beachwear. You don\u2019t have to be all that concerned about the environment to appreciate the sight of Mia Kang in a color-blocked neon two-piece, or Ericka Hart rocking a blush-tone metallic bodysuit, but it doesn\u2019t hurt. As always, swim was the focal point, but an influx of dresses and layering pieces verged into eveningwear territory. Transparent metallic skirts accented with turquoise piping could easily be worn for a night out, and bell sleeved cover-ups paired with crop tops made for an appealing proposition. Few designers celebrate the body in the way McCharen-Tran does, letting her oil-slicked models strut down the runway displaying every curve as they\u2019re cheered on. Her shows and their uplifting message of body pride have been instrumental in evolving the conversation around size within fashion, all of which makes you want more. After fine-tuning her aesthetic for swim- and bodywear, the time was right for a foray into fresh categories.

An industry veteran with her finger on the pulse of what young women want from fashion, Siskin didn\u2019t just design what she thinks will be their go-to party pieces: She built in a few styling details, too. The tied-up blouses, side-knotted velvet slip dress, and multi-printed skirts should mean less time spent in front of the mirror fussing over an outfit. \u201cOur audience really likes the idea of styling in interesting, yet not overwhelming ways,\u201d she said. Layering was a big focus, as it is every Fall. But Siskin\u2019s mix of textures and fabrics felt new.

Though versatile, the collection was caught in a place between dressing up and dressing down. The slipper mules and breezy tunics would work for any occasion, though, and were a subtle, familiar nod to those African themes.

The recurring motif came from a flat-lay photograph of a lily, taken by Li in her studio. She magnified the image by 500 percent to create a close abstraction of petals and leaves, then splashed it across all manner of items. It worked equally well on a coral silk calf-length dress, blue pajama-like separates, and a black-and-white mini with a twist at the front. That last piece felt lighter and younger than Li\u2019s past work, while the first maintained the elegant inclusivity (flattering on all ages and bodies) that has defined her. It\u2019s worth noting the fluffy fun of her Mongolian lambswool items, particularly the little slides and those enormous bags. \u201cIt\u2019s a bag, but you could use it as a pillow!\u201d she said, laughing.

Save for a splash of gunmetal-green and garnet red, the palette was predominantly black and white. In fact you could easily imagine Ocasio-Cortez, the outspoken Democrat congresswoman, wearing the brand\u2019s super-wide-leg white jumpsuit as a suffragette statement. Danan and Kern have been loosening up the silhouette of their clothes for the past few seasons, and the sweeping A-line shape of their new puff-sleeve evening dresses was modest without appearing frumpy. The same was true of the lightweight, oversize coats. Of the slinkier pieces, the black long-sleeved jersey dress with an abstract-art-inspired metal clasp would answer the call of duty on the red carpet without too much fuss.

Joan Smalls, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, and Michael B. Jordan, the new face of Coach men\u2019s, were among the celebrities who braved the freezing rain today. Still, there was one important fashion figure in the crowd who went relatively unnoticed: Kaffe Fassett. The famed \u201970s decorative arts guru is famous for his psychedelic works, and once posited, \u201cColor is one of the most mysterious, miraculous, wonderful things about life.\u201d Fassett\u2019s philosophy was a guiding principle for Stuart Vevers this season.

The creative director has a knack for making opposites attract, and this season the brand\u2019s sweet and light chiffon dresses were toughened up with basketball-style shorts in hefty checks and plaid. That late \u201990s approach to layering has been popping up all week, although nowhere have the proportions appeared quite as fresh and youthful as they did here. The woolen bomber jackets and cardigans played to a larger cultural shift that\u2019s been percolating for the past six months; as of last October, Coach is officially fur-free, and these were the brand\u2019s warm and fuzzy alternatives. Vevers has been experimenting with tailoring for both men and women lately, and the new Crombie coats demonstrated the range of his fashion smarts. You only have to take one look at the street style images on this website to know that the brand\u2019s mountaineering-style shearling jackets are popular with fashion-conscious boys and girls alike. Increasingly, Vevers has proved he has his finger on the pulse of the red carpet, too: Aside from Selena Gomez, a frequent collaborator, Coach recently dressed rising soul singer H.E.R. in a custom look for the Grammys this past weekend.

In the past, she has used her clothes to speak poetically about social media and society, energy chakras, and marrying one\u2019s true self. As a person, Taymour is straightforward. She is honest about herself and her abilities, about the pressures of commerciality in fashion, and the need to make money as a young designer so that one can see their passion through to its fullest potential. And she isn\u2019t afraid to admit her faults. This season, Taymour is being open about the fact that, hard as she tries, she isn\u2019t completely green. As written in her show notes, she still buys plastic water bottles at the airport, orders Seamless instead of cooking, and is an avid Amazon user. So in 2019, using her Fall collection as a jumping-off point, Taymour has vowed to change her ways. Her show started off today with a \u201cmini TED Talk,\u201d as she referred to it a couple of days beforehand, given by environmental activist and hip-hop artist Xiuhtezcatl Martinez. He spoke at length about protecting life and Mother Earth while models (including one very adorable baby) came down the runway. Taymour used 75 percent deadstock fabric, some of which she playfully called \u201cgranny couch fabric,\u201d made into very cool trousers and tops in swirling hand-painted prints and a daisy motif. In addition to those reused materials, Taymour also partnered with 4ocean to utilize beads the organization makes with recycled waste. These were incorporated into straps for a beautiful blush-pink dress that closed the show. Overall, the collection felt like one of Taymour\u2019s fullest and smartest yet. There was something for many different shoppers, from chic outerwear to a covetable new minidress silhouette. It was wearable and sellable, but as she gets to be a bigger presence on the global fashion industry scene, Taymour\u2019s main concern is staying true to her craft and staying on course to becoming a fully sustainable brand in the near future."}, {"Designer": "Colville", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Fall 2019 marks the third collection from Colville, the label created by a trio of former colleagues at Marni\u2014Molly Molloy, Kristin Forss, and Lucinda Chambers\u2014who also just happen to be very good friends. Why that latter fact matters we\u2019ll get to in due course, but for now, suffice to say that this collection more than delivers on the enormous promise shown by their Colville debut less than a year ago. Of course, why wouldn\u2019t it? Between them, Molloy, Forss, and Chambers, along with Marni founder Consuelo Castiglioni, conjured up a label that became an unlikely global powerhouse, beloved for its offhand luxury and artisanal flourishes. In turn they were able to create a powerful and intimate dialogue with the women who wore its clothes; to wear Marni was to be heard and feel understood. Colville follows that ethos, and in this moment, when so much fashion seems to be only interested in speaking at women, not with them, its presence is hugely welcome. Which neatly brings us to the importance of that friendship: This is a label built on honest and personal conversation, the aesthetic push and pull between friends figuring out what exactly works for themselves and for one another. Still, Colville\u2019s no Marni 2.0. There\u2019s something else going on here, perhaps because its founders are determined to keep their label small and personal, and intent on taking a slow and measured approach\u2014not to mention taking what seems like an almost punkish delight in rewriting the rule book by their own hand. And their point with that is simple: You should take the same ungoverned pleasure in however you want to wear their clothes. Put like that, and all of a sudden you can find your own way into wearing Colville. Perhaps with the fantastic black and white sweater in an almost ikat-like pattern, its gazillion raw threads flying hither and thither and knitted out of a yarn developed in Japan. Or the capacious trench cut from a beige cotton with a rippled and wrinkled patina as if it had been beautifully weathered, which you might throw over a color-blocked, multi-striped sweater, say, or a long dress in a floral wallpaper-like print that was described as wistful but would likely invoke more happiness than melancholy when it\u2019s worn. A slithery crepe was put to good use for another dress, cut on the bias in panels of heather and dusky rose and slipped under a matching parka in a paper-light technical fabrication. There are also things you might find madly useful but which you\u2019d never realized you needed until you had them: the striped wool arm warmers and neck cowls that could give warmth without a whole lot of heavy weight, or one of the clever little draped puffy boleros made from repurposed \u201990s shell jackets, an instantly transformative piece that is also one of Colville\u2019s forays into sustainability, along with the chunky ribbed beanies, the result of cutting up vintage knits. There are even Colville-logoed soccer scarves and tees and sweaters emblazoned with a very Jamie Reid\u2013esque treatment of the brand\u2019s name.

An excruciating soundtrack helped as an aural guide to the sight of women encased in black rubber armor with protruding hips and shoulder braces, nightmare peaked hoods, and ecclesiastical-seeming headdresses. Booms carrying movie lights zoomed in to loom aggressively over the women, throwing the complexities of the shapes and textures of their clothing into relief: strange cut-short farthingales, sleeves like banks of oil-slicked seaweed, dark Victorian taffeta ruffles, a puffball skirt uneasily hinting at the shape of an unexploded bomb. No doubt about it: The workmanship in these garments was phenomenal\u2014whether in the sculptural rubber pieces, emitting their simultaneous signals of submarine hulls, or warheads and fetish dungeon, or the intensely layered 3-D embroideries.

Wherever we are in the world, these are the fears and dreads we experience in the background of everyday life. Rei Kawakubo confronted them. \u201cShe reads the news; she knows what\u2019s happening,\u201d said her husband, Adrian Joffe. The music was a collaboration with the young London queer artist and DJ Parma Ham, while the consciousness pointed to a generalized fear of the 21-century arms race from an Asian perspective, what with Donald Trump playing with fire with the North Korean dictatorship, and Japanese political protest about the plan to move an American military base to an ocean site, endangering the marine environment, as well as peace. No War was a slogan stamped on a pair of tartan pants. Still, Kawakubo\u2019s message was perhaps not all despair and condemnation. There was a second clause to her gathering of the shadows collection title. \u201cMany small shadows come together to make one powerful thing.\u201d Of course, that is a double-edged statement, indicating the human potential for good, as well as for evil. But when the models clustered in a circle at the end of the show, you wondered, in a brief flash of hope, whether Kawakubo was overseeing a kind of women\u2019s ritual exorcism of all the bad.

Also, they\u2019re making clothes for \u201creal life\u201d\u2014suits, shirting, knits, tees, and dresses\u2014so it makes sense to put the garments in situations their customers might actually encounter (like running for a train, attending a work meeting, or swiping right on Tinder), rather than showing them on a traditional catwalk. Models Hanne Gaby Odiele and Teddy Quinlivan do star in the opening clips\u2014choose Hanne Gaby if you\u2019re a Type A, Teddy if you\u2019re Type B\u2014but otherwise it\u2019s a cast of fashion professional amateurs: Their PR person and stylist make appearances, as do Paris- and New York\u2013based editors, consultants, and other arbiters.

One of the collection\u2019s motifs was trompe l\u2019\u0153il; they cut into coats and jackets to create the illusion of three-dimensional collars, lapels, and flap pockets.

Meyer and Vaillant have gone the heritage-house-creative-director route, and, having come out the other side, are charting a new way forward. Are fashion shows necessary? Are designer collections just too expensive? Does Instagram success convert into real-life success?

Right now, when fashion has become so branded, categorized, and readily and easily identified, a little obfuscation on origins is kind of welcome.

She delivered a pithy and witty monologue in the lecture theater that acted as a soundtrack to Peters\u2019s and Gabier\u2019s show, variously riffing on the end of gender duality, ownership, corporate (ir)responsibility, and how values are the new value in our lives. Coming off of a NYFW that has been seeking its heart in (sometimes) the wrong places, this all made for an experience that was uplifting in its honesty, pragmatism, and, yes, hope. The clothes were key to this.

Cushnie also looked to the angular shapes of ikebana (the Japanese art of flower arranging) and the geometric folds found in artist Nicola Kloosterman\u2019s Shadowplay collage series.

The bias slip dresses looked effortless as they came down the runway, some with subtle draping at the front and others made with rich velvet fabric. There was a lot of richness to Cushnie\u2019s Fall wares in general, not only due to the sumptuous draping and fluid silhouettes but also because of the color palette.

A few of those looks were barely there, like the shoulder-tied asymmetric minidresses, while a sequined puffer and kaleidoscopic fur offered more zipped-up options.

While the clothes weren\u2019t necessarily breaking new ground, they had a retro energy that was fitting for Rowley\u2019s reintroduction to the runway. The silhouettes were rooted in the \u201970s. One standout was a silk crimson wrap dress with peasant sleeves and a blush pink oversize bow attached at the waist. More megawatt pieces included a pair of fully sequined cropped purple flares and a skimpy black dress with a ruffled hem. Knitwear in the mix was a welcome touch: One black sweater spliced with lime green lines had slouchy sleeves for a dose of insouciance. Though many of the clothes seemed fit for hotter climates, something that Rowley noted by saying \u201cthe sun is always setting or rising somewhere,\u201d there were some great puffer coats, including one covered in a head-turning watercolor print.

Rather than draw direct inspirations from the likes of Ophelia and Cordelia, Koma was drawn to the drama of costume and the exuberance of Edwardian dress. His most fanciful pieces came towards the end of the show, where butterflies and snakes were made out of silver\u2014yes, actual silver\u2014thread and bugle beads on tight minidresses, and the popular Edwardian hatch pattern was rethought in a rounded minidress. The drama of it all could be a bit overpowering at times, but perhaps that\u2019s the point. Koma\u2019s clients, from J.Lo to Taraji P. Henson, love a scene-stealing garment. For the rest of us, Koma has upped the ante on his daywear. Masculine and utilitarian themes ran through the early parts of the collection in darted jumpsuits and unzipped maxi skirts. It\u2019s mostly black and mostly very slinky, with bandolier-like cross-body belts and just-below-the-bum hemlines, though it would be unfair to say that Koma is not kind to his woman.

He had something for each neighborhood dweller, like the greige cape coat for a lady of Madison Avenue and the copper paillette embellished minidress for the girl going out at night in Chelsea. Basso constantly strives to create a full wardrobe for a range of women in his orbit and this season felt big enough (maybe slightly too big) and rounded out enough to accomplish that goal. There were also some faux-fur coats in the mix alongside his signature sumptuous minks and sables. The eveningwear was beautiful as always, especially the canary yellow wrap gown and the pretty blush pink slip with a hand-beaded floral motif cascading down the front. Overall, the collection could have been edited down just a tad, if only to create more synthesis between the individual looks and to better connect the dots within that Native New Yorker theme.

Instead, with Henri Scars Struck on the piano, his multigenerational models (including a white-haired gentleman 82 years young) milled about the space exchanging glances, embracing, and walking arm in arm in an evocation of what happens on the street.

It was an apt concept for Deveaux, where Ton has described the aesthetic as \u201cbeautiful everyday pieces with a gestural, loose fit.\u201d For close followers of Ton\u2019s post-street style work, this collection will look familiar. It\u2019s a reprise of the men\u2019s lineup he and Deveaux cofounder Andrea Tsao showed in January, only this time both women and men wore the clothes. In fact, the collection is almost fully interchangeable, with only the graceful bias-cut acetate dresses and scarf-neck blouses reading as categorically for-females, though time will probably prove that assumption wrong. Ton is very fond of a tossed-over-the-shoulder gesture; one novelty here were the cashmere crewnecks with built-in asymmetrical capes. His suiting is minimal\u2014there are no visible closures or hardware, for example\u2014but it\u2019s not clinical. That\u2019s down to the workwear inspiration behind the trousers and the jackets\u2019 relaxed, easy fit, a sensibility that extends to Deveaux\u2019s outerwear, which features sloping shoulders and sashed waists.

There were flower prints, a Dries Van Noten house speciality, but this time they were from his house, literally: \u201cWe picked them from my garden last October and photographed them,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted roses but not sweet roses\u2014roses with an edge, roses for now. Flowers can be romantic, but this I wanted to take out, because the times are tougher than in the past. So you see the diseases, the black spot, the imperfections.\u201d He opened with definitively elegant pantsuits in gray, top to toe. The first model, in a belted charcoal pinstriped jacket and trousers, carried a matching pinstriped puffer stole over one forearm, with matching pointed pinstriped high-heeled pumps, long black leather gloves, and a black leather clutch. She and the similarly gray-on-gray-clad women who followed had an almost stately aura about them. Van Noten let that sink in for a while before he showed a single flower. But when he did start introducing them\u2014with a single peach rose with blackened leaves, printed across the breast of a gray shirt\u2014there was something pleasingly off about it all. The odd, nearly clashing mauves, pastel greens, and yellows; the way some of the double-layered printing, on a veil and the garment beneath, messed with your vision. There were satin coats and high-necked, long-sleeved shifts; a shockingly purple padded coat; what looked like the yellow leaves of a whole acer tree vibrating on a black satin coat. A print of Kniphofia\u2014the red hot poker plant\u2014reared up from a hemline and then pollinated a weirdly yellow and orange-tipped fake-fur wrap and bag. There was what we saw, and then what we felt; a strange atmosphere of melancholia evoked by the words of Roy Orbison\u2019s \u201cCrying,\u201d with intermittent, harsh passages of Belgian accordion music. It was in a concrete basement space, and the music hinted at a fin-de-si\u00e8cle rawness; the impression that we were watching this display of elegance in a bunker couldn\u2019t be pushed away. It was Dries Van Noten at his reassuring best as one of the few designers who can be solidly relied on to back women up with a fully resolved, thought-out wardrobe for living through, no matter what. Much as he can evoke a mood, tune in to the changing times, signal artistic awareness, he is also a great pragmatist. He will have all bases covered in a collection, paying proper attention to office attire\u2014maybe political office, why not?\u2014as well as opening up a spectrum of evening dressing. Brilliant strokes came our way there: a long black column with a side drape sprinkled in gold and silver microbeads; a gold glitter trouser suit with a sheer veil thrown over it; the stunning black tuxedo that bookended the show with an identical silhouette to the opener. A video was later emailed to the press showing Van Noten and his team at work in his garden in Antwerp, Belgium\u2014up ladders and in borders snipping flowers. And what a palatial garden, with its lawns and huge box hedges, one might say! The point of the exercise, he said, was \u201cto have everything authentic.

Tonight, Dsquared2\u2019s Dan and Dean Caten exhaled a sartorial fuck it, and went pedal to the metal. The move paid off to hedonistically satisfying effect. The Catens nailed an unlikely trio of inspirations for Fall (showing both womenswear and menswear together): winter sports, nouveau-grunge, and psychedelic indulgence. \u201cOur keywords are steep, Nirvana, and opulence,\u201d said Dean. \u201cSteep giving you 2,000 meters above sea level, you know, snowboarders . . .\u201d Dan jumped in: \u201cand Nirvana isn\u2019t really like the grunge of back then, but there\u2019s some element of it, some plaids; we\u2019re Canadian after all.

He was obviously in Los Angeles, letting his party-animal side run free in its natural habitat\u2014parties, after-parties, and after-after-parties\u2014and, along the way, dressing a few celebrities of the likes of Glenn Close\u2019s daughter, actress Annie Starke, and singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding. \u201cMusic is very important to me,\u201d he said. Coming from a family where music was played constantly (his mother was a professional violinist, his father plays the piano, and Dundas himself plays the violin), he understands both the importance of theatrics and what it takes to dress a performer for visual charisma. His knack for glamour is part of his style equation. Just ask Beyonc\u00e9. Music was the subtext for the eighth drop of his collection. Having recently spent most of his time in America, Dundas said he wanted to pay a sort of homage to \u201cclassic Tennessee performers, to Elvis and Roy Orbison, who always dressed in black,\u201d he explained. He was also taken by the dark, gothic vibe of the Los Angeles music scene. But Dundas\u2019s dark side always comes sunny-side up, brightened by ample servings of rhinestones\u2014he cannot resist a good dose of sparkle. He called this collection \u201cRhinestone Cowboys Going Graceland.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love to dress Dolly Parton,\u201d he mused. Yet Hollywood played a much more convincing role here than Memphis, with plenty of sexy numbers that will keep Dundas aficionados swooning (there are quite a few, and not only in the showbiz arena). The darker tone the designer was referring to could actually be perceived in a more extensive than usual use of black; case in point was the opening look, a pantsuit in luscious black velvet inspired by the bedazzled country-and-western Nudie suits\u2014born in the 1950s and worn by everyone in Hollywood, from Cher to Johnny Cash to Gram Parson. The Dundas version entailed upping the sexy factor more than a notch, with the blazer cut in a va-va-voom almost-hourglass silhouette, \u201970s-inspired flared pants, and abundant bejeweled and sequined embroidery. Black velvet also gave a sensuous vibe to a maxi robe cardigan, lavishly embellished; a draped bustier minidress fringed in gold; and to a halter-neck open-back number with a high front split, drenched in antique gold and gunmetal decorations. If you have the physique for it, the effect would certainly be a killer. Flame red contrasted the black vibe in a leather-and-suede figure-hugging pencil skirt and blouse, or in a not-for-wallflowers long pleated taffeta dress with a sash flourishing on one side. Yet Dundas was at his best when he let his bohemian spirit do the talking: A sweeping long ruffled gypsy number in patchworked printed lam\u00e9, fil coup\u00e9, and lace intarsia looked sensational. It didn\u2019t seem intended only for Dundas\u2019s audience of celebrities, though: It\u2019d look smashing gorgeous on (almost) anyone."}, {"Designer": "Duro Olowu", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Cosmopolitan, chic, and Afrique were the three words that Duro Olowu used to describe the spirit of his Fall 2019 collection, which was inspired by Miriam Makeba, the fearless South African singer and civil rights activist. Makeba, who was known as Mama Africa to her fans, possessed a wardrobe that was purpose-built as a celebration of African pride at a time when her country was in the grip of apartheid. You could see her influence right off the bat, in a graphic knit coat with patch pockets and detachable snood (Makeba was rarely seen without a towering head wrap or hat). That motif was repeated to flattering effect on an A-line maxi dress that could have been pulled from her closet. Admittedly, Olowu is a fantastic composer of print in his own right. The leopard prints that he folded into the collection were a nice match to his signature florals. The vibrant colors of Stanley Whitney\u2019s abstract paintings informed the irregular polka dot patterns that lent an eye-catching touch to a black double-breasted coat with fuzzy Mongolian fur sleeves. Olowu rarely wipes the palette clean, but when he does, the results can be just as dramatic as his marvelous prints. Case in point? A black taffeta high-waisted tuxedo skirt that was paired with a matching pussy-bow blouse with billowing sleeves. It was an elegant proposition for evening that is likely to seduce die-hard minimalists who might have been too afraid to try his vibrant aesthetic in the past. Still, it\u2019s hard not to fall for Olowu\u2019s mesmerizing print play, especially when it comes draped along a slinky bias-cut dress in painterly tulip brushstrokes. Naomi Campbell was clearly charmed. The supermodel was among the first attendees of his salon-style presentation in Mayfair this morning.

The crux of the collection was inspired by menswear, they said, deconstructed and resculpted for (mostly) women, but then again, in the spirit of the times, that\u2019s open to interpretation. There were lots of attractive things here, particularly those that were faux\u2014what woman wouldn\u2019t want to wear a midnight-blue \u201castrakhan\u201d coat or a white \u201cfur\u201d cape-jacket?

Granted, an hour-long fashion presentation isn\u2019t something every editor or buyer can commit to. With only one model onstage at any one time, very few attendees would have been able to see every look in the collection, which included some eye-catching outerwear in silk jacquard, an opulent fabric that\u2019s been everywhere in London. Still, the unconventional format was food for thought, underscoring the importance of community and creative kinship in fashion. And given the quiet nature of Lee\u2019s clothes, which tend to evolve incrementally each season, the experiential approach was a smart way for the brand to stand out.

The influences were too subtle to pick up from a cursory glance at the preview today, but study the garments up close and they were there: the kimono sleeves on a printed chemisier and the landscape print picked out in embroidery on a long dress. More of a reach: the rain-slicked streets of neon-lit Tokyo in the metallic sequin pliss\u00e9 numbers backed by the house signature prints. Color and print are at the foundation of this Italian heritage brand. Both were well represented in the collection. Color came in unlikely combinations\u2014the mint and burgundy of a blouse and trouser set was Harajuku-inspired, apparently. Novel prints took cues from the archives without lifting from them directly; see the metallic silk of an oversize, obi-sashed shirtdress that was the collection\u2019s standout piece. It was simple and effortless, and keyed to the current wavelength for oversize, slouched-on proportions. What this collection lacked was a definitive message about silhouette. There was lots of earnest exploration, but not a firm enough point of view. Pucci has been without an official creative director for two years. If the label is going to capitalize on the concept of travel, as the Japan trip seems to suggest, and on the resortwear that is at its mid-20th-century roots, that easeful shirtdress in liquid silk would be a smart place for the design team to start work for next season."}, {"Designer": "Emporio Armani", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere I\u2019d rather be,\u201d went the opening line of the soundtrack to this show.

The harmonies rang truest in a middle monochrome section that linked racy-for-here, latex-effect fitted shoe-boots over layered looks that variously referenced men\u2019s tailoring (strongly darted, with big-beaded enamel necklaces), couture-ish double hems and a fit-and-flare patch skirt with an Emporio Armani anagram, and bombers in elevated black fabrics (one teamed with a want-able Armani-portrait T-shirt).

He took inspiration from the furnishings, paintings and wallpaper of the family palazzo for his extravagant brocades and florals, mixed with a note of Catholic mourning and the tales he heard of Pamphilj\u2019s troubles during the war. There were bubble dresses and bows galore, sweeping trains and gleaming ostrich-feathered embroideries. Where were the English \u201960s? Maybe in the hints of Mary Quant\u2019s early use of groovy lace tights, tweeds, and kinky leather boots. The innocent, virginal fashion for upstanding frilly collars had a lovely moment in a white chiffon tiered dress with a row of black velvet ribbons. Moralioglu scripted in the story of how the principessa wore her jewels on the inside of her jackets at one point, and the fact that she ordered a wedding dress patterned in black roses, out of respect for her deceased father.

This was impressively realized, especially in the Look 3 wide-leg, jacket-cinched suit, and as the enthusiastic crowd telegraphed, there is a keen clientele for this silk-and-steel Scervino combination. The counterpoint to that first coat was a mohair-fluffy topcoat in leopard for men further into the show. This hinted at would could have been a fun screwball runway comedy of code swapping, but as a pitch it fell quickly away. Sparkly rib knits for men came in an equivalent tricolor pastel for women. There were plenty of attractive and clearly finely made pieces, especially the shearlings and the suiting. Barely a hemline was left without an underlayer of lace. Swarovski-adorned Peter Pan collars played the spangled innocent against the suggestive moue of semi-sheer slip dresses. From its rhinestone Peaky Blinders section to its Matrix-meets-Showgirls moment, this was a solidly-Scervino Scervino show that made you reflect on quite how and why it is that one of the most consistently referenced designers in menswear and womenswear alike was a 19th-century heir to the British throne.

Escada has historical capital, but it doesn\u2019t have much in the way of current relevance. Design director Niall Sloan\u2019s job is to reverse that equation, or to at least bring it closer to equilibrium. Recalibrating the presentation was a start. Adjusting the aesthetic is the harder job. Sloan picked a heck of a backstory. Having watched Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story, he was riveted, not just by the Austrian actress\u2019s beauty, but also by her ingenuity. She was an inventor on the side, and developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes; though it was discounted by the Navy until the 1960s, decades later it would go on to inform the development of Bluetooth technology and Wi-Fi. Lemarr was beauty and brains personified\u2014and irresistible to a designer with both glamour and power dressing on his mind. The actress\u2019s scandalous 1933 film Ecstasy became a graphic on a white midi skirt and sweatshirt, and her escape from her controlling husband, as recounted in her autobiography, informed the inside-out clothing embroidered with crystals. (Apparently Lemarr split wearing maid\u2019s clothes, her jewels sewn into the lining of her garments.) Elsewhere, Wi-Fi symbols decorated intarsia knit scarves. Like we said, quite the backstory.

There\u2019s been a sneaker collaboration and a custom dress for Beyonc\u00e9 when she performed at the Global Citizen Festival. There was the pop-up in Cartagena, Colombia, a charming lifestyle store (judging by his Instagram posts) where he debuted an accessible, permanent Resort collection (more on that later). And 10 days ago, he revealed his role as guest curator of Sotheby\u2019s Now! auction for young collectors. All these pursuits have not distracted him from producing the Fall collection, a buoyant affirmation of his multi-inspirational vision. Consequently, as he explained from his showroom across from the Louvre, he harbors no regret in taking a break from the runway this season. \u201cThe thought process was to scale back in a certain way and be more focused on how to get this collection out there,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, somehow you have more freedom by doing it this way.\u201d Enter \u201cCaribbean Holly Golightly\u201d with her updo and hot pink opera gloves, the streamlined city gal, and Michelle Elie playing her eccentric, exuberant self. Photographed by Cortazar\u2019s longtime creative collaborator Jaime Rubiano (who also shot the Cartagena background images), these three characters personified his followers more dynamically than a linear runway procession. So, whereas the first shows off her \u201cLatina glamour\u201d in brightly hued, ultra-flattering dance dresses, the second wears the collection\u2019s most understated yet persuasive look: a ribbed sweater tacked naturally at the sleeves with a pair of shorts with a geometric overskirt. Elie, meanwhile, shows off Esteban Cortazar at its most experimental with skirts over coats, sweaters styled as turbans, and miscellaneous layerings of T-shirts, tailoring, and lustrous silver pants. On the brand\u2019s Instagram, this look was referred to as \u201cHaitian jazz Hammer time.\u201d Cortazar drew our attention to three noteworthy elements: More than any previous collection, this one features pieces reworked from his archive, even if they don\u2019t date that far back. Some of the reworked jackets and coats made a strong case for pushing his tailoring more deliberately. But then the knits were also thoughtfully developed with sultry, plunging backs and the aforementioned romantic sleeves. Lastly, his use of both a humble wool stripe and a decadently beaded fishnet resonated nicely with his equal-opportunity approach that extends to his reasonably priced offerings. Buyers can complement their edits with printed shirts featuring authentic kitsch Colombian graphics or illustrations by Cortazar\u2019s artist father. Oh, and Shala Monroque shows up in a single image that appears at once elegant and offbeat (her necklace is made from two kinds of pipes).

The reasons might seem straightforward: a renewed global interest in heritage houses generally\u2014and more specifically, those with clear and transparent artisanal traditions\u2014and a growing preference on the part of consumers for the sort of crafty special pieces at which Etro excels, items that preference personality over utility or trend. Clothes that embody \u201cvalues\u201d have value at the moment. This is a good thing, especially when those values come in the form of a chartreuse velvet jacket, richly embroidered, nipped and peplumed, and dripping in crocheted lace. That piece was one of the many gems shown today for Fall 2019 at a music conservatory in the heart of Milan that Verdi once aspired to attend. The theme of the collection was, essentially, heritage disrupted: Veronica Etro began by taking inspiration from her family\u2019s archive of 18th-century paisley scarves, a trove she revisited when planning for the 50th celebration. Into the luxe mix of paisleys, jacquards, and tapestries, she added nods to Cool Britannia, both the \u201990s Britpop moment (when Veronica lived in London and admired the stylings of It-girl aristos such as Stella Tennant and Honor Fraser) and the punk era, which captivated her young Milanese self. The opening portion of the show was paisley through and through, and literally head to toe in the case of a caped Guinevere Van Seenus. (Can paisley be a neutral? It would seem so . . . . ) Then, stripes and preppier references entered in (boyish rugby, yummy Fair Isle) creating the sorts of print/pattern mash-ups that are a signature of the house. Finally, the collection tilted to the Victorian/Edwardian with jet beading, gold-thread embroidery, lashings of taffeta, yet more capes, and an endorsement of opulence when worn in an offhand, just-heading-out-for-a-pint-of-milk way. The long evening dresses were especially lovely, delicately patterned and overlaid with caviar-beaded lace. The tiny cocktail dresses were also compelling: strongly strapped, loosely corseted up the back, and chicest when gilded. The show featured models of all ages\u2014from the legendary Farida to the American teenager Cara Taylor\u2014and, in a season of age-diverse castings, here it felt right, not forced. Mostly the women looked like themselves, or an opulent downbeat version of themselves. Mostly, they looked like cool reflections of the mind of Veronica Etro, who is perhaps the true reason behind her brand\u2019s unflashy renaissance. Every season, she imbues the codes of the house with some personal fascination of her own\u2014be it female surfers or Beat writers or her own decades-old love of the Clash and Oasis. She doesn\u2019t seem to rely on the research binders of well-paid stylists or to bow unthinkingly to the whims of marketing folk. She is true to her enthusiasms and curious about the world, which speaks beautifully to the DNA of the Etro brand."}, {"Designer": "Faith Connexion", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Fittingly, the first runway Faith Connexion show under Nikola Vasari\u2019s creative direction took place in an underground club.

Slinky dresses in embellished mesh or embroidered in wisps of silver, tuxedos in puckered bronzed brocade, and myriad pieces with rips and holes that had been filled in and outlined with sequins and chains attested to the brand\u2019s luxe positioning. Leather looks offered some noticeable novelty: finely fringed on a jacket, or skirts with tearaway flounces. Elsewhere, there were echoes of \u201980s Paris through tiers of printed chiffon trimmed in feathers, while graphics on the guys\u2019 clothes suggested a very faint undertone of Asian influence (Vasari said his travels inevitably seep into the design). As usual, the lineup resulted from several specialty collaborations, including NTMB (Never Too Much Basic) and Pisco Logik, plus newcomers Rockins, Schott, and Kaimin. There was little to bridge all the going-out/onstage attire and the tailored coats and tricked-out jackets. But what seemed like an absence of daywear might actually be relative.

The way he sees it, a great coat is the linchpin of style, the piece that can elevate sweatpants or dress down a gown, so best to keep it sophisticated and essentially chic. That said, Arbesser\u2019s Fay is not boring. He has built ideas of layering and transformation into the collection in innovative ways. Some pieces, like the one in Look 4, are actually several jackets paired together\u2014in this case a puff base layer, a gray coat, and a burgundy gilet\u2014allowing for endless styling options. There\u2019s a similar cobalt coat with a burgundy cropped vest and a white puffer with removable black detailing. These transformations are clever without being fussy, and the same goes for Arbesser\u2019s rethinks of Fay\u2019s signature four-hook jacket in simple caramel with contrast stripes. The four-hook style has an easy parallel to firemen jackets, an idea Arbesser explored last season and has wisely stepped back from for Fall in favor of a more refined polish.

Those signature touches included the stiff, high Edwardian collars that Lagerfeld himself wore and riffs on the scissor-sharp tailoring with geometric seams that he returned to every season. This time, those seams defined a strong, sharp pagoda shoulder line or the A-line panels in a perfectly fitted coat. There was also a play of layers and translucency that included laser-perforated \u201cfishnet\u201d leather. The interlinked double F logo (dubbed \u201cKarligraphy\u201d) that Lagerfeld himself invented in 1981 was reimagined in the copperplate font of his own handwriting and woven into hosiery or used as an intarsia on shearling. (The classic Fendi brown-and-beige stripe, worked in shearling for an overscale frame-handle bag, was one of the accessory hits of the collection.) The furs, a category that Lagerfeld redefined with soaring imagination and invention as a seasonless contemporary fashion item for Fendi, included an overscale mink shirt with contrast intarsia suggesting the shadow of the collar and pocket flaps; an amazing tone-on-tone effect of Art Deco palm fronds worked into a black suit with a trim, \u201940s silhouette; and a perforated trenchcoat, the soft buff fur punctured to reveal flashes of pale gold beneath the surface. \u201cThe last touch was the scarf,\u201d said Venturini Fendi, referring to the unexpected flourish of broad ribbon threaded as a belt in back, ends fluttering, on many of the dresses and coats, which lent a touch of disheveled romance to the clear-cut silhouettes.

An icon, let it be said, who never once contemplated retiring from the job that began seven decades ago as a studio assistant with the thoroughly Parisian couturier Pierre Balmain. In the weeks before his death, Venturini Fendi remembered, Lagerfeld\u2019s mantra remained: \u201cI have to work on my collections.\u201d During the fittings, he would interrupt his stream-of-consciousness observations and bon mots to politely admonish the tailors and dressmakers, explaining that the garment in front of him was not exactly like his sketch; \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he would say, \u201cbut it\u2019s a millimeter off just there . . .\u201d As Gigi Hadid closed the show in her diaphanous buttercup-yellow dress, the crowd rose to their feet\u2014just in time for a short movie clip of Karl Lagerfeld, who was asked by filmmaker Loic Prigent to sketch his look the day he arrived in Rome to work for Fendi. Lagerfeld, of course, remembered it perfectly as he sketched with the effortless panache with which he imagined thousands upon thousands of amazing pieces of clothing. In this instance, a fedora from Cerruti to cover his long hair, a Norfolk jacket in yellow-and-red English tweed, a printed Lavalliere cravat, French knickerbockers, and dark glasses\u2014a look he described 54 years later as \u201cmauvais gen\u201d [disreputable].

It was obviously intended as a humorous take on the subject. The label\u2019s style is a mix of au courant trends\u2014a not-so-groundbreaking formula rather common these days for collections lacking a deeper inspiration. The same can be said about the so-called contrast between masculine and feminine, which is often invoked as an easy-way-out reference, equating a collection with modernity. The zeitgeist points right in that direction though: Fluidity of gender is just a fact, not a trend anymore. The Belgian girls\u2019 take on the subject was approached lightly. \u201cWe mixed femininity with streetwear, then we added lots of masculine details on quite simple shapes,\u201d they said. The collection was proof of this dizzy attitude. Called Powershift, it was inspired by motocross and mud wrestling. For such seemingly sophisticated European girls, it sounded like rather rough territory to explore. \u201cIn the collection, the mud is very present,\u201d they explained. Cases in point were a pair of brown jeans, embellished with beige sequins to reproduce a mud splash; denim pants with washes replicating tire tracks as if thrown under a motorbike; and oversize denim sleeveless bikers emblazoned with motocross patches.

A sumptuous burgundy burnt-velvet long cape, decorated with raised-embroidered floral bouquets, exuded a flair of romance, as if designed with that doomed heroine in mind. Many other pieces in Ruffini\u2019s opulent, sensuous Fall outing, rich in velvets, wool jacquards, and silk brocades, presented as usual in her lavishly dark Milanese apartment, would have felt right at home in one of Henry James or Edith Wharton\u2019s novels. Ruffini indulged her penchant for sophisticated drama throughout a collection dense in exotic prints and patterns, sensual in the smooth consistency of high-style textures, expressive in the painterly flair for warm, vivid colors. Shapes were elongated and fluid. While the signature pajama suits were still prominent in the offering, Ruffini added shirtdresses in various lengths to be worn over palazzo pants and a series of elegant, protective wrap coats, which looked pretty sensational in their printed flamboyance.

It\u2019s understandable when a designer creates a conceptual collection that befits a thoughtful, slightly esoteric narrative or if their point of reference needs some sort of bigger context when tied to the clothing. There is always a starting point, of course, some spark of an idea or inspiration that catalyzes a new season. But, that being said, it\u2019s quite another thing when a brand, especially one within the contemporary sphere, tries to get deep when discussing a straightforward silhouette like a slip dress or a pair of jeans. Jens Grede and Erik Torstensson have never been those guys. The founders of Frame have remained steadfast in their pursuit of simplicity and their dedication to making clothes for customers who want to live their lives in chic, effortlessly cool garments. No history lesson, styling tricks, or fantastical whims necessary. The women who stock their wardrobes with Frame staples will undoubtedly adore the new, recycled cashmere knits for fall, as well as the sleeveless silk navy dress with a cowl neck and the tan suede pencil skirt and matching button-down top. If Grede and Torstensson ever did a proper show, which they deemed unnecessary long ago, their cozy camel bell-sleeve coat, as well as a faux python trench (a new favorite of stylish women like Paloma Elsesser and Kaia Gerber) and their double-breasted denim boilersuit would be real runway hits.

While she\u2019s adamant that Fran\u00e7oise is not about tackiness, there were a few coy, almost campy moments, like a \u201970s maxi dress made in sweatshirt jersey that was trimmed with a Verner Panton\u2013like sunset, or a Western-inspired shirtdress that Senyk admits is her take on Elvis. Her references can be a bit random like that\u2014some teatime florals here and some techno velvet there\u2014but it all comes together to a delightful effect. The most random one? A red silk midi dress that Senyk joked was modeled after a cardinal\u2019s robe. Yes, the cape sleeves give it a particularly vestment vibe, but with a double keyhole on the chest and a scooped-out back, it\u2019s more preacher\u2019s daughter than woman of the cloth.

Twenty-two-year-old Kelsey Juliana and 10-year-old Levi Draheim are representatives of Our Children\u2019s Trust, the nonprofit organization supporting 21 young people across America in their fight for court ordered implementation of systemic science-based Climate Recovery Plans to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations to safe levels before 2100.

How efficiently can I do what I do?\u201d She\u2019s been asking herself those questions since the start of her business. Today she answered them in at least two ways. She believes that if a customer can choose a recycled cashmere felt coat rather than a regular cashmere one, she probably will. Similarly, if she can get the look of fur with a lofty plied wool cashmere, odds are she\u2019ll make the environmentally-friendlier choice. Beyond the eco-conscious bona fides, Hearst\u2019s calling card is her sophisticated tailoring. Her suits have become standbys for women who want to signal a seriousness of purpose and look chic doing it. Though she deemphasized them on her Fall runway, she didn\u2019t let us forget about her sartorial prowess. The first two exits were sharply cut black double face cashmere coats, enlivened with Uruguayan coin buttons. Mostly, though, this collection was a showcase for knits of cloud-like softness.

Gabriele Colangelo, who has never deviated from his sometimes stark minimalist aesthetic, solved the conundrum by reverting to artistically elaborated textures and fabrications. It\u2019s the only form of decoration admitted inside his rigorous design perimeter. For Fall, the list of elaborate fabrications used for the collection\u2019s streamlined looks was lengthy. Suffice to say, Colangelo personally designed and overlooked the execution of each one of them. \u201cIt was definitely an artistic process,\u201d he said. The results suggested as much. Velvets\u2019 and cottons\u2019 surfaces were burnt or eroded to achieve dynamic abstract patterns of liquid beauty and lightness. Their sensuous, tactile appeal graced a series of clean-cut dresses: a marigold tunic layered under an elongated wrapped column in blue-gray hues, and a sunflower yellow slim midi dress worn with a cropped asymmetrical gilet with voluminous sleeves in a contrasting cerulean color. By Colangelo\u2019s standards, the collection exuded more ease and confidence than usual. Warm colors were featured prominently on skillfully cut linear shapes and elongated silhouettes. Honey-colored featherlight napa leather gave slightly oversize volumes a tactile quality, while folding and draping were used with a light hand.

Building on the strong colors and textures of last season\u2019s Ziggy Stardust\u2013inspired offering, Karadottir and her Galvan cofounders, Anna-Christin Haas, Katherine Holmgren, and Carolyn Hodler, conceptualized a vibrant lineup. The Bali references were well executed. A one-shouldered ruffle dress featured a print based on traditional sarong textiles without being too literal. The mustard velvet fabric used for high-waist trousers and a matching wrap top called to mind Bali\u2019s marigold flowers, and the green silk of a slip dress was the same hue as the country\u2019s rice paddies.

Look back at the pictures from his couture show last month and then switch your gaze to these shots of next-season Giamba, his licensed ready-to-wear line, and you\u2019ll see there are many points of contamination between the two: the bell sleeves, the black lace, the exclamation marks of black taffeta, the softer eddies of tulle, and the full-skirted, large-volume panels dresses. One difference here, of course, is that these pieces are factory made rather than atelier crafted, and the fabrics are not nearly as elevated. Another is that this line is pitched at a poorer but very probably cooler audience than those fortunate (yet probably cosseted) enough to buy couture. This leaves Valli and his team free to experiment with a sportswear-etched interpretation of his aesthetic. Matte black velvet track pants and a track jacket that softly glinted via a metallic treatment and featured sleek ruffle detailing were standouts here.

Prettiness is a natural instinct for Valli and Monet\u2019s idyllic gardens of Giverny satisfied his need for uncomplicated beauty. In that sense, the coquettish, micro floral-print dresses were the most straightforward rendering of his vision for Fall.

It went from an opening section of Vitruvian-precise double-breasteds into a loose trousered flirtation with single-breasted jackets into a blue-busting section of black tuxedos. The more exuberant ornamentation came in the womenswear. Atop pants cut slim or with jodhpur eruptions at the quad, Armani served a pre-millennial nightclub\u2019s worth of smoky whorl and twist. From the bunched swirls of leather on the square-toed boots to the glinting shivers of midnight blue pattern under mesh on jerkin tops, or the hard exhalations of leather ruffle on handbag straps, or the meandering back-and-forths of leather peplum, this was an overwhelmingly dark collection packed with playful decoration. Bow-belted pleated pants were served south of a silk shirt in shifting clouds of midnight blue. A double-ruffled leather collar furled forth from the neckline of a leather-piped black velvet jacket.

With that in mind, the designers headed into Fall with renewed energy, ditching the \u201970s influences of their previous collection in favor of modern eveningwear with a relaxed vibe. The majority of the pieces were easy and appealing options for a night out: A black satin jumpsuit with a loose cut will always look good, but it doesn\u2019t require the diligence of, say, a skintight cocktail dress. Pickersgill and Wong also used Fall as an opportunity to delve into two of fashion\u2019s current obsessions, sustainability and modest dressing.

Then there were the masks: Jason Voorhees masks, fetish store masks with 2-inch-long spikes, a stupendous brass eagle with talons clutching the jawline. At the press conference afterwards, Michele explained his fascination, saying, \u201cA mask is hollow but also full.\u201d It conceals and reveals; it\u2019s a defense and a welcome sign; disorienting and its opposite. More subtle, but just as thought-provoking: the metal ear coverings. Hearing enhancing? Or hearing obliterating? The masks were runway artifice, not for sale, Michele said postshow\u2014not with those 2-inch spikes. But he sees clothes in the same way; they\u2019re the means by which we become what we feel we are, an open possibility.

Many of the pieces were unfinished, with basting stitches tracing seams or the outline of outsize lapels, and raw edges elsewhere. Pierrot collars, in contrast, seemed to speak of childhood whimsy and innocence, as did the nonsense words ice, lolly, and sucker that appeared throughout.

(The brand later issued an official apology in response to the public uproar.) Designer Rio Uribe has been on the front line of this debate since he launched Gypsy Sport seven years ago. It\u2019s brands like his that have opened up a conversation about gender, size, and race in fashion that was desperately overdue. And his latest collection was a reaction to the unmentionable bigotry still festering in the industry\u2019s dresser. The message, as Uribe put it at his show in Soho today, was clear: \u201cI wanted to prove that truly every body can wear lingerie.\u201d If you thought the underwear-as-outerwear trend was beyond reinvention, then Uribe\u2019s Fall collection will turn your expectations inside out and upside down. The Californian designer has made sustainability a number one priority in recent seasons, and for Fall he sharpened his skill for upcycling once more, repurposing discarded Adidas tracksuits as sexy teddies and slinky slip dresses and camisoles with lace insets that alluded to the skin. (If the German sports giant hasn\u2019t already considered an official Gypsy Sport collab, they absolutely should now.) Uribe has been developing intricate new chain-mail techniques lately, too, and his spaghetti-strap dresses and bras were meticulously assembled by hand; in the case of Richie Shazam, the gorgeous nonbinary model and photographer, it was a web of houndstooth-shaped leather pieces, while artist Corey Wash had interlocking black-and-white bottle tops draped over her baby bump. Uribe didn\u2019t confine his new designs to the boudoir, though. The designer flipped bourgeois dress codes with an early-aughts attitude that recalled girl bands like Destiny\u2019s Child and TLC. His deconstructed houndstooth pantsuits and ingenious argyle denim jeans marched a conservative uptown uniform into the underground atop four-inch-tall, steel toe\u2013capped club stompers. The results underscored not only Uribe\u2019s boundless imagination but also his impressive technical know-how. The designer\u2019s instincts for casting are just as keen; half the magic of a Gypsy Sport show is in the people who give life to the clothes. New York ball legend Kevin Aviance walked the Gypsy Sport show for the first time and worked every inch of the catwalk in a pearly king-inspired suit.

The prints and jacquards (including one spotted on Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet earlier this month at the BAFTAs) were lifted from the patterns of butterfly wings, but the references remained abstract and graphic. Ackermann had Jane and Serge singing \u201cJe T\u2019aime . . . Moi Non Plus\u201d as backup\u2014steamy stuff.

There was certainly tailoring here at which to marvel. The fitted jackets with the sculptural draped lapels worn by women in chevron stripes, butterfly jacquard, and solid white were impressively elegant. The slouch of robe coats\u2014in white and camel for the ladies, and a vivid shade of red for the gentlemen\u2014was appealing, as well.

Both guys are old enough to remember the \u201990s, when Helmut Lang the man was one of fashion\u2019s defining voices, and their new collection is Lang-ian in the extreme: a mix of immaculate tailoring, stiff jeans, boxy slip dresses, and streamlined parkas, served up with a wink of kink. There were looks on the runway tonight that seemed plucked from Helmut collections: the sleek double-layer tank with the tuxedo pants; the white parka on white shirt on white pants; the Crombie coats. More so than Thomas and Cawson\u2019s ability to reproduce them so definitively, the real marvel is how clothes from collections that are now two decades old look so modern. Could it be that minimalism ages better than other aesthetics? Or is that just me, having come up in the \u201990s and spent more than I could then afford at Helmut Lang sample sales? A brand representative said that production has returned to Italy. That was the alchemy of Helmut Lang then: that the clothes had a casual attitude, but they were made with the care that typically went into much more formal attire. This latest version of Helmut Lang has a lot going for it."}, {"Designer": "Herm\u00e8s", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "There\u2019s been so much discussion of the meaning of the bourgeois this season, what with the likes of Celine and Burberry, respectively, reaching for the touchstones of French and British conservative fashion values. Herm\u00e8s\u2014the most haute of haute leather goods companies in the world\u2014might be thought of as not just epitomizing but being somehow the mothership of all the codes. Nad\u00e8ge Vanhee-Cybulski, who designs womenswear for the house, politely shook her head at that notion in her backstage interviews. She prefers to define Herm\u00e8s as \u201cclassicism as a modern way of seeing life\u201d\u2014a philosophy that lifts the label\u2019s modus operandi well clear of whatever trend enthusiasm might be galloping through fashion at any given moment. You need only spend a few seconds zooming in on her Fall show to perceive that Herm\u00e8s exists both semantically and qualitatively above and to the side of fashion\u2019s whims. Its extraordinarily made clothes and accessories are tooled to last for generations, not to be tossed aside in the never-ending cycle of consumption\u2014old-fashioned behavior is literally the new \u201cmodern.\u201d Nor would the house want to hitch itself to the bandwagon of sustainability, since nondisposability is just how it has always rolled: Vulgar wastefulness is the antithesis of posh. Which is where this collection was quite personal for the designer. Three of the simplest looks\u2014textured, knee-length leather pencil skirts and long-sleeved printed silk T-shirts embodied time-defying emotional continuity for her. The T-shirt print, she said, was the one \u201con the very first scarf I saw from Herm\u00e8s, my mother\u2019s.\u201d There were no identifying show notes to describe the techniques that produced the surface effects in this collection\u2014one suspects they must be Herm\u00e8s state secrets. \u201cI want to turn leather into almost a textile,\u201d said Vanhee-Cybulski. With Herm\u00e8s craftspeople, she can. What is certain is that the finesse that went into the contoured seaming of a parchment-colored glossy calfskin shift dress is literally inimitable. More practically, the makings of Herm\u00e8s\u2019s huge variety of outerwear is what haute couture is to ball gowns. Consider the textured camel-hair cocoon coat with its Herm\u00e8s-orange double-face lining, pyramid-shaped leather buttons, and a single pocket with a leather flap fastened with a utility D-ring\u2014or any of the leather-piped coats, come to that. There were iterations of the voluminous cold-weather utility coats that have been threaded through the season, \u201cleather on the outside, goose feather on the inside,\u201d the designer noted. Vanhee-Cybulski knows how to tether branding to the attractions of the house, whether it\u2019s simply a matter of triggering the use of Herm\u00e8s orange or displaying the H logo in silver on bag hardware. Granted, there were empty, squashy oversize totes being clutched, but it was the glossy, structured, smaller-scale shoulder bags that landed nearest to being the most classic\u2014and also the most ragingly fashionable item on that runway. Forget the quirky distractions of the leather shorts and whatever. Post-decadence, after the dressing-up parties to forget the collective nervous breakdown the world is facing, what will endure as a reason to spend is the long-lasting, well-made classic product. Whatever trendy fashion has to say on that topic, it\u2019s Herm\u00e8s that has the real thing."}, {"Designer": "Hillier Bartley", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "New Romantics and Sloane Rangers might seem like strange bedfellows.

To wit, a double-breasted houndstooth suit was punked up with a transformative zipper across the waist (essentially a two-for-one, to be worn as a cropped jacket or tailcoat) and a clever origami pleat along the trouser. The duo has a taste for glam rock, too, though the fantastic new party pants were an ode to the King of Pop, and that sinewy, MJ-inflected aesthetic was a nice counterpoint to the more exaggerated suiting. Bartley has mastered the art of the going-out top, and for Pre-Fall, her magenta blouse took the prize with its exquisite draping and elegant Adam Ant\u2013style wrapped statement sleeves. The trapeze-shaped \u201ccassette\u201d bags that came in rich purple suede and metallic green were a winner for evening, too, a chic and practical replacement for the classic tricky-to-handle minaudi\u00e8res.

The runway was clad in brightly printed posters that reflected the color and chaos of the vast mesh of influences at work in the clothes: \u201cWe wanted to create a bit of a cityscape,\u201d said Holland of the backdrop. \u201cThe show is about a global explorer, and something that I see everywhere I go in the world is the fly-poster.\u201d East-meets-West detailing spanned from Mandarin collars and closures to Japanese obi knots, as well as arresting Mexican and Cambodian influenced fabrications which found their way onto trenches, dresses, knits, and filmy two-piece pantsuits. Holland\u2019s continuing collaboration with Grenson on hiking boots broke new ground\u2014there were ponyskin iterations with Western-flecked spurs. Mexican-blanket knits and thick platform soles brought a punkish air to tie-dye prints and utilitarian, armor-like outerwear.

And yet he\u2019s not an entirely empty copyist. The asymmetric peplum effect belting leant heavily upon at the start of this show breathed a gasp of life into seen-it-all-before shapes. It was fun to apply a quilting effect in crystal to dresses so tiered they seemed tantamount to breakdown. Stringing pearls around a right ankle rather than the neck had a similar spirit.

An \u201980s vibe has been in the air across the board this season, which is undoubtedly Marant\u2019s sweet spot: Strong shoulders, nipped waists, and peg legs have long been a recurring theme in the brand\u2019s repertoire.

The only insinuation of skin was the tiniest sliver that appeared between thigh-high boot and boho wrap skirt. Neo-bohemianism has been making a tentative comeback on the runway for the last couple of seasons, though for Marant that free-spirited mood never left. The colorful, quilted jackets were reminiscent of classic pieces in her archives, and will likely have success with her fans the second time around.

Later, there were a series of looks in Miyake\u2019s signature springy accordion folds whose monochrome pattern resembled the keys on Sebu\u2019s synth, but jumbled and distorted in size and perspective. Miyake\u2019s famous and much-counterfeited triangle panel Bao Bao bag material was adapted and lightened into what looked like synthetic fabric, gently heat-pressed with a triangular grid (hence, perhaps, that interlinking equilateral runway routing).

Manipulation of materials is the bedrock of Mendel\u2019s practice, and for Fall it was evident in a red mille-feuille pleated dress with an asymmetric ruffle neckline and a confectionery pink princess dress; keepers, both. Elsewhere, there were hit-and-miss attempts at a younger feel.

Take, for instance, the long pleated skort or the thick pin-striped pants with a top half made from the bottom half of a suit blazer. She incorporated a preppy check pattern and two Ivy-style sweaters that could be worn a few different ways thanks to armhole cut-outs at the shoulder of each sleeve. With so many designers creating unisex collections these days, it was inspiring to see a woman interpreting menswear in a succinct way and with very few literal notions attached.

She got wild with it, combining separates like a matching striped bodysuit with a pair of sharp fuchsia trousers, and a sheer, lacy blouse with flared check pants with a matching cape. There were still a couple of pretty floral-print frocks, but overall, Fall 2019 was more of an exploration of Stuart\u2019s personal style, one that her longtime fans will undoubtedly love to play with just as much as she does."}, {"Designer": "Johanna Ortiz", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Sun, sea, and sand are always on the horizon at Johanna Ortiz. For Fall, the Colombian designer had a picture-postcard backdrop in her mind\u2019s eye, namely Arus\u00ed, a remote agrarian paradise on the Pacific coast of Colombia. Inspired by that landscape, the new offering\u2019s earthy palette of russet brown and forest green was consistent with the bigger color story of the season, both in Europe and New York. Ortiz is a passionate lover of floral prints\u2014each season she infuses a rare exotic flower into the collection\u2014though this time she used hand-carved wooden canoes and malocas, the distinctive homes of the region\u2019s indigenous communities, to create her own toile. It was a clever way to shake 16th-century motifs from their Eurocentric, pastoral roots, and that revisionist tableau looked modern and fresh on gently fluted day dresses. (The custom toile also appeared on the hessian rugs that lined the floors of the gorgeous Paris apartment where Ortiz held her presentation.) Oritz broke new ground with her approach to embellishment, as well. Spun with a web of tiny green Perspex tiles, her \u201cfisherman\u2019s net\u201d dress was a colorful update on the idea of chain mail, and the mini crocheted purses were a complementary partner. The crisp cotton hand of Oritz\u2019s ruffled peasant blouses was revisited in black taffeta for evening and lent a pleasing, dramatic tone to one of her most popular signatures. Beyond driving her own business forward, the designer is committed to growing a creative community in her homeland. After collaborating with Paola Mendoza and Galer\u00eda Cano for Spring, Ortiz invited Colombian accessories designer Andrea Vargas of Monolito into the fold for Fall. Worn as statement necklaces, the sculptural perfume vials were a cool foil for the romantic dresses. Though the tiny bottles were left empty, Ortiz is planning to make her own scent with Vargas. It isn\u2019t the first time the designer has dipped her toe in the world of beauty\u2014she made custom lipsticks with her makeup-guru friend Aerin Lauder.

John Elliott and his new women\u2019s designer, Cara Campagnoli, were idly chatting when they realized they both hail from the same coastal town north of San Francisco. They also learned, upon further digging, that their grandparents were friends. A few calls back home confirmed the synchronicity. Thus a concept was born: \u201cAn atmospheric beachfront house,\u201d Elliott explained during a preview, among the \u201ctwisted cypress and ever-present mist of Northern California\u201d\u2014the kind their grandparents called home. \u201cVery Hitchcockian,\u201d the designers agreed. Suitably, the collection took place in the Navy Yard of Brooklyn in a dimly lit, wet-floored industrial warehouse used to make modular homes. The show focused around a skeleton of a house from which the models emerged. The unfinished space fit neatly with Elliott\u2019s experiments in process, among them a padded jacket nicely faded so that missing patches left ghostly marks, akin to removing furniture from a weathered deck; and a bomber jacket made from insulation-like material in a method so exacting that it can\u2019t be produced in large quantities. An abstract print on polar fleece derived from Elliott\u2019s grandparents\u2019 own wallpaper, and a laboriously stitched floor-length poncho could have been lifted from an old homespun rug. A proprietary tie-dye technique involved bleaching rolls of fabric and overdyeing it with rich indigo; otherwise the palette remained in the moody zone of misty-gray, green, and sand. Elliott\u2019s myriad collaborations returned as well, including those curiously seamless down jackets with Descente and leather biker jackets with Blackmeans, both Japanese companies, plus two new shades, brown and black, of his runaway-hit sneaker with Nike, the LeBron James x John Elliott Icon. Add to that an entirely new apparel collaboration with Caterpillar, a sleek departure from the construction company\u2019s bulky connotations. Elliott said he was going for a long and black look so that it could segue into night. Very Hitchcockian. As a whole, this was Elliott\u2019s elevated streetwear elevated further\u2014a familiar wardrobe wrapped in concept. The women\u2019s side, introduced more recently and now fully incorporated, seemed to have found its place as a feminized version of men\u2019s, but not too removed from the unisex silhouette that streetwear demands. The matured vision will need a home to call its own. Enter Elliott\u2019s just-signed new store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles, where his line is based and manufactured, opening this Spring.

It was all scorched earth, with flowers shooting up from desolation, blue skies and sunsets as only California can do them. By the time she parked, Fall\u2019s story had taken form. Cue an accessible, even comforting palette of neutral shades, spun out in blanket coats, snake print, and 1970s-inflected motifs flecked with gold. As a California brand par excellence, Joie has the luxury of sidestepping (or ignoring) anything that feels tricked out or otherwise contrived in favor of offering a loyal base legible pieces that are just trend-aware enough to get them where they want to be. This season, those options include a three-quarter bronze dress with a flounced neckline, a checked pantsuit with easy tailoring and cropped flares, pretty pleated floral-print skirts and dresses, high-waisted jeans tailored like trousers with patch pockets in front, and cargos with satin-finish pockets that elevate casual just a notch. Rutson\u2019s mantra for Joie is \u201cnothing contrived\u2014it has to be soft and useful.\u201d That probably explains why the brand\u2019s fortunes keep growing in the high double digits year after year.

So when he was back in Mexico a few months ago, he purchased an armful of vibrant traditional rugs and brought them back to New York. Here\u2019s where his singular process comes in: He cut up and deconstructed them, then arranged the tiny scraps into flower patterns, which he then transferred to a digital printed silk. It appeared in the opening look, a silk tuxedo jacket and midi dress, but looked particularly good on a long, flowing patchwork gown (there were panels of striped jacquard and a grid print Cohen also designed with the rugs) topped with a baby pink hand-knit cardigan. Another wrap dress had a miniature version of the flower print, and he translated it as an embroidery motif on his signature poplin \u201cslash skirts.\u201d In general, it\u2019s those more relaxed dresses and knits that will end up in the closets of stylish, influential women. Cohen got his start making evening gowns and party dresses, and his longer, ribbon-striped gowns\u2014one in ivory, one in black\u2014had awards season potential.

Their roots lie in the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, and Simkhai pored over family snapshots and images of traditional Ukrainian dress, before landing on richly embroidered scarves as a focal point. This allowed Simkhai to incorporate the lace that has characterized his line until now, as he embroidered the scarves\u2019 swirling prints onto marigold lace dresses and a little black top. More elaborate floral and paisley motifs unfurled in unorthodox places, like printed twill or discharged denim. (The latter fabric has come to the fore since Simkhai moved to Los Angeles a year and a half ago.) There was more outerwear, too, and the printed puffer jackets felt like a nice addition. Simkhai\u2019s last look was a stunner: a glimmering gold scarf dress, slightly ruched at the hip and painted with tiny purple buds.

For one, Joseph still shows in the same showroom in Paris\u2014no more shows\u2014that, in an Uber ride across Paris, can feel like a stop in a more boh\u00e8me casual world by the canal. Inside, the routine and much of the ideology is the same: clothes a woman needs, hung orderly on rails, camel-colored or ivory or burgundy. According to those in charge, Clayton wants to bring it closer to the body, a little tighter while still being both comfortable and comforting. Strange for a designer making a big debut to be absent on her big debut day, but perhaps it\u2019s a statement about the clothes speaking for themselves. But what does a poncho buttoned up like a bandolier say about closeness, rigor, or practicality? Maybe smart to focus outside of the styling tricks. The Joseph basics are best: elongated trousers, accommodating pleated skirts, one very covetable black pony-hair jacket. Even jersey is given the just-slightly-luxe treatment, double-faced as a stiff turtleneck or a boxy tee.

Watanabe got hopes up, as Steff Yotka put it her Vogue think piece, around the need for MILF representation on runways. Yet disappointingly, he proved not to be the man to follow through with projecting age parity on the women\u2019s side of his business. Rather, the absolute opposite: Watanabe called his collection Kawaii, after the Japanese cult of sugar-sweet cartoon girly-ness. Granted, the pairs of young models who proceeded out in wigs tied up in infantile bunches didn\u2019t look all that cutesy on second glance. Their fake eyelashes were askew, their pink lipstick was laid on too thickly, like dolls that had been played with by a child. Once you started noticing that, you also noticed the puzzling fact that there wasn\u2019t an Asian face included in the casting. That\u2019s odd, when you think about it, from a designer who works in a company owned by arguably the greatest Japanese leader in global fashion, the legendary 76-year old female designer Rei Kawakubo. (There weren\u2019t any Asian men in the January show either.) But to the clothes: Maybe there were intended ironies coded into the chopped-up flower prints, which were reassembled as grunge patchworks and worn over jeans with either spiked biker boots or (the best thing) fancy silver leather\u2013trimmed suede Western boots. The collection continued in the collaged style of joining one part of a familiar utilitarian garment with another. By now, this is a familiar Watanabe practice (in his menswear collections he does it with lists of collaborating brands); one he\u2019s developed in step with what Chitose Abe (another ex-Comme des Gar\u00e7ons designer) has made so successful in her Sacai women\u2019s collection. This is not intended to roast the content of Watanabe\u2019s women\u2019s collection\u2014it was full of comfortable and utilitarian clothes that possess the rare, inherent quality of having nothing difficult about them.

Tailoring is the big topic of the moment, so the timing is right for Surridge to lean into what he\u2019s good at. The animal and tropical prints that have long been central to the Cavalli aesthetic are more learn-as-you-go for Surridge. He approached the signature animalier motifs in a clever way: by hand-drawing zebra and tiger stripes, he produced a lower-key vibe that he liked. He did his best to avoid tropical prints\u2014too clich\u00e9. The closest he came was a cotton trench with pliss\u00e9 details in a dark green foliage motif that could\u2019ve been camo.

First the men\u2019s, then the women\u2019s collections played out against the backdrop of wildly illustrated murals by the late artist and shaman Pablo Amaringo, with music that was traditional yet trancelike. Many of the visions were intensely saturated and collided urban with expedition elements\u2014hot pink suits, pinstripe outerwear that glinted silver, polar fleece in optical patterns, and a whirling atmospheric motif that was unearthed from the archive. But the real point of departure actually emerged from an idea very close to home: Humberto Leon\u2019s father\u2019s Chinese-Peruvian heritage. In the mid-19th century, people of Chinese ancestry settled in Peru; they are referred to as Tus\u00e1n and they now number in the millions. Leon said he still has family there and flew them over for the occasion. They would have likely recognized some of the traditional garments, creatively updated: pollera skirts, now boasting drawstrings and worn with puffer jackets; hot pink ponchos in waterproof technical fabrics; and blanket plaids as workwear shirts or sweaterdresses. The season\u2019s statement print appropriated the bags used to import rice; pairing it with pieces in papery leather elevated it to art party attire.

As they are so identifiable, it will be interesting to see who ends up carrying them. Most interesting of all was how Leon and Lim connected the personal nature of these collections back to the activism that they are usually so comfortable expressing.

Dancer Megan Myers had dropped by the label\u2019s uptown shop and found a natural kinship with the clothes, and as she tried them on and moved gracefully around the store, the idea struck Kes that Myers might better show her clothes in motion. It\u2019s a notion Kes first experimented with during last year\u2019s live art performance; fall took it one step further. A woman in a red matte silk gown stood center with brown curling hair that resembled Kes\u2019s own.

Additional dancers began moving about the room with those same hand motions. One girl in a champagne-gold wrap dress pushed heavily onward, as though she was wading through a murky pool. Things took off when a dancer in a floor-length silk took center stage: the dynamism of her movements conveyed more energy than the others, and the fluid swirling skirt made a compelling case for Kes to work with modern ballet. Some clothes lent themselves to this exercise more readily than others. A black bomber jacket and fitted cropped pants, for instance, gave its wearer precious little to work with.

The first look out was new territory for her: an ivory \u201cgown\u201d comprised of a mutton-sleeved ribbed turtleneck tucked into a long poplin skirt and cinched with a gold medallion belt. It was a cousin to a cherry poplin gown Holstein showed for Pre-Fall, which Amandla Stenberg wore to the Critics Choice Awards. (Poplin for evening? That\u2019s so Khaite.) There were fancier tulle gowns and black-tie-worthy dresses in the show, too, likely a result of Khaite\u2019s recent presence on the red carpet. Mixed in were Holstein\u2019s best-selling cashmere pullovers, jeans, and crisp blouses. Those casual pieces actually transmitted her message best: The collection was titled The New Frontier, and Holstein said she was thinking about the turn of the 20th century in America, when women first began to travel alone and were beginning to join the suffragette movement. On the brink of a new era, it was an exciting\u2014and sort of scary\u2014time, not unlike how many of us are feeling in 2019. \u201cWomen need a voice that celebrates the strength of women right now, and, as a consumer, I think that was lacking,\u201d Holstein said. \u201cEspecially here in America.\u201d That got her thinking about strong, timeless, truly \u201cAmerican\u201d pieces, from those staple poplin shirts and jeans to Southwestern fringed jackets, whipstitched coats, and all manner of leather and suede trousers. Even the finale gowns in semi-sheer tulle were cinched with Western belts (albeit in real gold and studded with garnets). The balletic beigey pink one in particular looked like an Oscars contender. Elsewhere, the show was simply a testament to Khaite\u2019s excellent, elegant daywear: For many women, Giedre Dukauskaite\u2019s taupe sweater, chestnut suede trousers, zebra-striped boots, and leather tote would be the ultimate casual-luxe uniform.

The outdoorsy-ness was present in their fabrications\u2014see a royal purple and sky blue dress in windbreaker nylon\u2014and their first collaboration with Asics. The running brand provided the sisters with stretchy base layers and helped them to create their first sneaker, a cross-strap style that rebukes the clunky sneaker trend. An incredibly smart pair of burgundy trousers with black insets at the knees was drawn from hiking pants, while another shoe collaboration with Camper produced knee-high hiking boots with Victorian lace-up details. Knitwear is the Fannings\u2019 strongest suit; this season, they have grown their offering in delightfully strange ways. Bias-draped knit skirts are paired with blouson-sleeved sweaters in all manner of stripes, while too-large hoods-turned-collars shrugged down past models\u2019 shoulders. The most intriguing pieces are the curvaceous sweaters with trompe l\u2019oeil bustiers and built-in hips, color-blocked to evoke the cinched silhouette of turn of the century bandidas. The sisters name-checked the Mexican and Central American femme fatales as an inspiration for their ability to clash with the popular culture of their time. That freewheeling spirit was present on the catwalk today, heightened by nomadic hair and makeup inspired by the 1988 cult film On the Silver Globe. On top of all this, they added ropelike scarves and grape-cluster necklaces and the occasional gauntlet that flared out at the elbow like a medieval knight\u2019s glove. It is impressive that, in their early 20s, the sisters have created such an all-encompassing vision from daywear to dresses to accessories and collaborations\u2014but will people join in? If it looks a bit brash on the runway, know that up close on a hanger, these are perfectly salable garments.

Kim Shui was struck by the one-sidedness of the matter, specifically those modest prairie dresses dominating the conversation. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough sexy on the runway anymore, in my opinion,\u201d she said. \u201cOn Instagram, there\u2019s sexy and there are women who want to dress sexy. I wanted to provide those women the option to feel covered if they want, or to feel sexy and show skin if they want to, as well.\u201d Shui went on to note that this sort of raw sex appeal has more often been the domain of male designers; she\u2019s here to offer up a woman\u2019s point of view on the matter. Provocation has always been part of the Kim Shui equation, and this season she went further, perhaps to please the very raucous crowd of Instagram peacocks that filled her front row. \u201cI keep pushing it more and more and more,\u201d Shui said, laughing. There was the snakeskin and chintzy brocade she loves, as seen on an outrageous brocade coat with faux fur sleeves that looked like something your kooky aunt might have picked up at a flea market in the \u201960s. Alongside them, a few beaded taffeta blouses evoked the same thrift shop air, though Shui\u2019s came with corset boning and saucy cold shoulder cut-outs. Tie-dye, always a winner, figured largely in the collection, as she recast many of last season\u2019s highlights in this more kaleidoscopic palette. Fall\u2019s version of the excellent silk leopard qipao, for instance, was a tie-dye velvet number guaranteed to be a hit. Additional highlights included a beautiful lime green cowboy shirt, cut from floral habutai silk, and a tiny top and skirt in the same acidic \u201970s shade, plus knit Marcia Brady\u2013like tights printed with the English word lost and the Chinese word for demon. A case might be made for a touch of editing. Those moments when Shui did Shui stood out sharply, but there was a great deal of noise around them.

Drawing inspiration from Anna May Wong, the Hong Kong-Chinese\u2013American actress of the \u201950s, Simmons has imbued her collection with richness and glamour. A shimmering fuchsia suit is worthy of a screen siren, as are some beaded navy trousers that evoke the free spirit of Cher\u2014or they could, if styled right.

But equal with discussing the waxed nylon puffers and the many collaborations within the show\u2014Disney, Rhude, MISBHV, Adidas Terrex, Pendleton, Russell, and Vogue\u2014Fieg was concerned about a model resting her feet one atop the other. Politely, he approached her to let her know that the suede New Balances were to be modeled with two feet flat on earth. \u201cThose are like the most important shoes in the show,\u201d he demurred afterward, which is saying something. The first 40 looks of the collection did not repeat a shoe once. Product is crucial to the Kith modus operandi. By owning a retailer with an in-house line, Fieg has the luxury of knowing what sells\u2026and then making it himself. He does this mostly through collaborations, though his own collection of menswear has expanded sizably beyond the jogger pants it started with. Clothes are easily styled the way Fieg or his fans would wear them, and plenty were on display in the front row tonight. But as the designer himself admits, \u201cThe event is equally important as the product.\u201d Inspired by the upcoming opening of Kith\u2019s Paris location and a winter trip to the Amangani Resort in Wyoming, he christened the show Kith Air and used digital video mapping technology to make the interior of Cipriani Downtown appear like the base of the Eiffel Tower, the Sahara desert, and the Swiss Alps.

To her credit, Maria Giovanna Paone, daughter of Kiton\u2019s great mastermind Ciro, understands that to expose a fresh audience to this tradition, you must first get them in the door. So this season\u2019s collection, if as yet only subtly, still marked a loosening. Although that Ciro-defined sartorial tradition remains Kiton\u2019s credo, Paone here drew some fruitful inspiration from her mother, Rosaria\u2014one of whose \u201950s Paris-bought boucl\u00e9 pieces was the basis of a full-armed monochrome boucl\u00e9 coat with matching high boots that has already excited the buyers. A silk blouse with panels of fabric on the front prone to dramatic wafting when worn was teamed with a full black skirt. A white cashmere kimono evening look came with a stole of albino chinchilla. There was, of course, a great deal of tailoring: fuchsia-accented evening suits, a tuxedo, and a white double-breasted jacket. Jackets were also liberated from their orthodox down-south counterpoints\u2014aka matching pants. This represents heresy for Kiton purists but worked well because it allowed you to focus on the jacket without classifying it as part of a suit. A pale, soft-shouldered cashmere mini caban\u2014almost alive with delicately counterpointing plies of marl\u2014was woven, of course, in cashmere and came with a belt for cinching. It was fantastic.

The novel construction of shirtdresses gave them multi-use functionality\u2014you can button up the hems and create shorter, softly voluminous silhouettes. Elsewhere, Willow revisited her signature wispy dresses, which she pieces together like puzzles from rectangles of silk georgette. A few of the breezy frocks have built-in capelets to be worn on or off the shoulders. She said they were inspired by Wonder Woman. It\u2019ll take super-heroic efforts to modernize fashion manufacturing, let alone save the planet. When will we all realize that it\u2019s us that\u2019s the endangered species?

What\u2019s the designer of Koch\u00e9, a little label that cross-pollinates streetwear and couture, doing at a mega-venue like that? Inviting all the fashion students in Paris to attend as guests and otherwise making good on the messages of diversity and inclusivity that she\u2019s trumpeted since her start in 2015. Like Kocher\u2019s previous outings, this show featured a mix of professional models, friends, and street-cast beauties of all colors and genders. As they walked by, their names flashed on the jumbotron and the LED screens circling the arena\u2014Adilack, Kelton, Morgane, Alix. (The one negative about the space was the distance between the models and the seats.) As with the women and men who wore them, Kocher\u2019s clothes this season were a global patchwork, especially the spliced football jersey numbers, which were spectacular. She collaborated with the Paris Saint Germain team for Spring 2018, but these bias-cut dresses\u2014some embellished with feathers, lace, and sequins\u2014were more ambitious, combining uniforms from countries across the world. \u201cIt\u2019s nice as a message, bringing geopolitics together,\u201d Kocher said backstage. The cross-pollinating didn\u2019t end there: After a research trip to Japan, she built 25 pieces using wool from the country, some of them merging traditional Eastern shapes with couture-ish Western ones, like the orange karate gi topped by an extravagant ostrich-feather chapeau, a nod, Kocher suggested, to Yohji Yamamoto. That coat had substance to it, a real heft. But Kocher\u2019s true gift as a designer is her ability to combine dressmaker techniques with the ease of activewear\u2014to soften couture codes and give them the everyday sensibility that young people who grew up in leggings and sweatpants demand. Those football jersey collages are a good example of this, but so is Kocher\u2019s own uniform: a jacquard Le Smoking that she accessorized with sneakers and a nailhead-studded bodysuit.

In Paris this morning he revealed both his women\u2019s and men\u2019s collections, which were developed with a similar resolution (though the women\u2019s side was a bit glitzier). \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a three-part series of ideas. I wanted one to be . . . the opposite of the image of luxury, but done in materials that are considered luxurious,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that are destroyed, some of which have been partially repaired. The other was about mountaineering, but mountaineering in the \u201970, before they had high-tech material, before they had Gore-Tex. And the last was patchworking.\u201d The best of these concepts was Abe\u2019s anti-luxe sentiment. He showed a ratty scarf that had holes cut out from its ends\u2014but the material was cashmere. For men, there was a textured blazer with those mock-moth-eaten abrasions, which exposed a quirky Hawaiian floral-print lining beneath. For women, there was a simple crewneck cashmere sweater, likewise maimed by hand. (Abe mentioned that he had instructed his factory staff exactly where, and how big, to make the cuts.) Another example, in womenswear: a great wool car coat in somber gray, but with bright red adhesive bandages zigzagging atop it. The mountain climbing and patchwork stuff was also convincing and, again, freshly myriad in effect. Collegiate sweaters were chopped with misaligned necklines; rappelling whipcords were tangled and bunched around the backs of winter jackets for both sexes. What did it all amount to, then?

Red lights flickered through a haze of smoke, evoking the forbidden air of an all-night rave, as buyers and editors hovered in standing-room-only formation along the runway. Turns out the London-based designers had all manner of subterranean activities on the brain when they conceived of Fall, including the illegal dance parties of their youth. (For La, who describes himself as a \u201cgrumpy old raver,\u201d they took place in abandoned warehouses in Washington, D.C.; for Dickely, it was disused barns in rural France.) That teenage angst was simmering under the surface of the collection from the get-go, in the exaggerated wide-leg trousers and the all-seeing-eye prints on skintight turtleneck tees that riffed on \u201990s techno flyer art. On the flip side, a more adult yet equally taboo influence: undercover agents. Dickely and La had been binge-watching spy movies, including Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s The Conversation and The Lives of Others, a German film that explores the surveillance techniques of the Stasi. The designers\u2019 research prompted a bigger discussion around the endless shape-shifting that is expected of women as they move through their lives. A mission that can seem impossible: How to navigate the world with a quiet sense of grace while being constantly scrutinized? La and Dickely\u2019s response toyed with the line between the professional and the perverse. The best tailoring came with vaguely 1940s dimensions, billowy through the leg and long on the body, layered up with butterfly collared shirting. There\u2019s been a darker mood rolling through the collections all season, and the lean, black, faux leather pantsuits captured that foreboding vibe. The leather and faux leather trenchcoats in particular would have been right at home in The Matrix. Ultimately, it was the gentler iterations of a Kwaidan uniform that won out, including the aforementioned mannish suiting and the more fluid drawstring outerwear.

Denim maestro Jeffrey Rudes has done it again and designed his \u201cFrench\u201d denim, which hugs the hips and legs perfectly and features a retro red-and-white block logo on the back pocket. The skinny jeans have a tiny bit of flare and call to mind the figure-flattering styles made popular in decades past by labels like Jordache and Gloria Vanderbilt. Rudes wanted to infuse some nostalgia into his latest collection for L\u2019Agence, and he definitely hit the nail on the head with his new cut of denim. He also did so with a range of double-breasted blazers in rich colors and fabrics, and a pair of \u201970s-inspired wide-leg trousers. Rudes\u2019s boho-style frocks felt fresh for a millennial customer, too, even if rehashed from a bygone era. Some of the most covetable and modern pieces, though, came in a blown-up leopard print, which was used on a silk slip dress, a camisole, and skinny jeans. Rudes isn\u2019t in the business of reinventing the wheel, and he listens closely to what the L\u2019Agence woman wants from season to season.

Mixed in with the archival motifs from the century-and-a-half-old Mantero print house and others from Martin\u2019s vintage collection were three prints designed in-house at La DoubleJ.

Louise Trotter, formerly at Joseph, has been brought in to refine Lacoste\u2019s fashion identity and help push it up the rankings. With this debut collection, she sometimes drifted into the Zone, that unforced sweet spot of inspiration and relaxation in which players produce their best game. Her most effective strokes included long pliss\u00e9 nylon skirts under oversize pouch-pocket track tops, which were a straightforwardly effective modernization that you could see working on the street. The pique paneled sweatshirts and deconstructed oversize croc logos on cricket sweaters like the ones Ren\u00e9 Lacoste used to wear were good too, as was the section homaging the brand\u2019s key shade of green. Sometimes, however, Trotter drifted out of the Zone: For while you could almost see the creative calories that had been expended to conceive oversize macs with attachable additions, bisected knit dresses, pliss\u00e9-panel-appendixed pants, and many other tricky pieces, this trickiness seemed forced and unfunctional. She was risking her point by playing a tweener when a forehand would do. Trotter should try to relax into this gig. Stress-saturated creative intensity is her thing, as we used to see at Joseph, but here at Lacoste perhaps a different mindset is called for to reflect the nature of the brand.

Drums boomed and trumpets blared to fanfare the ascension of Bruno Sialelli to the Lanvin throne. We were gathered to witness his coronation in the original Gothic 14th-century townhouse once inhabited by the abbots of Cluny, now home to France\u2019s National Museum of the Middle Ages. Which made you think: While no new designer should be judged by the backstory of the house that\u2019s hired him or her, this was an environment conducive to the contemplation of the past. Lanvin\u2019s ancient history is as beautiful as its recent history is ugly: Since 2015, its womenswear timeline has been bloodier than Game of Thrones. To make way for Sialelli, Lanvin\u2019s kingmakers most recently jettisoned their only functioning creative limb, menswear designer Lucas Ossendrijver, in a manner utterly unbecoming of the codes of honor, courtliness, and gentilesse that were so fetishized when this venue was built. That, however, is not Sialelli\u2019s fault. His debut was a collection that was eager to please: a huge all-you-can-eat buffet of ideas. These included woolen jackets with sailor collars and leather ties; pea jackets with quilt-piped, heart-shaped lapels; double-hemmed kilts in mismatched checks; tricksy, check blanket ponchos; and foulard smocks for him and her in a manuscript-style St. George and the Dragon print that also popped up on pochettes and as an embroidery on a backless, rope-choker-neck dress. The venerable Jeanne and Marguerite Lanvin logo was used as a print on a skirt and pants. There was a seemingly new, all-90-degree JL logo that featured on both the carpet and the garments (and the sneakers between) as a monogram or standalone signature. There was mid-calf, wide-cut carpenter\u2019s denim (and moleskin) worn with longer, silk Lanvin-logo pajamas beneath; fringed sneakers; suiting bisected by cinching panels of knit at the abdomen; scallop-hemmed, patched leather jackets; a suit-and-clog combination for men; blanket overcoats and skirts; and a fine silvery Lurex button-up dress undone by a skirt of sleeves for phantom arms. The collection also included both-gender twinsets, minidresses, and shirts featuring Babar and Zephir (another beautiful French institution with a questionable narrative), a series of layered slip dresses with patched extra hems at the back that sometimes came embroidered with foxes, a very fine purple bobbled dress (vaguely caftan-y in mien) and, we\u2019re nearly there, a final segue through some vaguely \u201970s-looking illustrations and print on the closing pieces. And, exhale. So, while Sialelli most certainly served a diverse spread, excellently executed, much of it felt marinated in the aesthetic of another place\u2014his previous employer, Loewe. This is understandable in this first instance. The from-every-angle blitzkrieg of variety in the collection can be seen either as the fruits of a boundlessly fertile mind or as a bloatedness borne of lack of focus compounded by a lack of confidence in any of the many subsections in this collection. Whether it is inventiveness or insecurity, all should become clearer in future collections (Lanvin\u2019s bracingly Red Wedding approach to human resources depending). What this collection did illuminate is that Lanvin\u2019s newly crowned prince has the potential to transition the house from its dark age to a new phase of relative expressive enlightenment. But the only one who can write that manuscript is Sialelli himself."}, {"Designer": "LaQuan Smith", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Let\u2019s make one thing clear: Laquan Smith is here to bring the glamour. Of course, Smith\u2019s version of the concept isn\u2019t about billowing ball gowns or staid cocktail dresses; he specializes in unbridled sensuality for the Instagram generation. Apt to outfit his models in sheer fabrics and towering heels, Smith is a provocateur who has cornered the market on eveningwear for exhibitionists. With high-profile fans like Cardi B, Kylie Jenner, and Beyonc\u00e9, his collection has become a hot ticket, with the block-wrapping lines, gate-crashers, and star-studded front rows that accompany every big New York Fashion Week event. Given the buzz, Smith seemed intent on delivering more than the traditional show, and, at times, his Spring Studios event felt larger than life. A booming voice played over the speakers, commanding models to strut and the audience to take them in as they arrived solo or in groups of three. Reminiscent of a ball or a \u201990s-era Versace show, the commentary helped set the tone for the evening as it announced, \u201cHer style is rich\u2014when you think Laquan Smith, you think fashion!\u201d The energy was magnetic and the audience engaged, but the clothes are the make-or-break proposition of any show. Smith traded Spring\u2019s striking mug shot prints for an array of tartans and leopard, an unexpected combination with varied results. On a puff-sleeved minidress with clashing patterns, the mix worked well, but transparent leopard turtlenecks worn beneath strong-shouldered power suits felt like a runway-only styling quirk; the spots were more appealing when they comprised the entirety of the look. A nearly nude bodysuit on Danielle Herrington had risqu\u00e9 charm to spare, while an opaque version of the same style in slate gray looked just right beneath a fur stole. Smith designs for vixens, but even they have day jobs, and he offered several pieces that should appeal to those who consider themselves reserved. A boucl\u00e9 duster and green knit column dress combination require little attitude to pull off. Likewise, pencil skirts worn with baggy sweaters offer a different version of sexiness. Men were given an opportunity to preen with bare chests peeking out beneath cardigans and candy-color sweats accentuating muscles. A range of options is always a smart business move, but the more daring things got, the more Smith was in his element. Off-the-shoulder minidresses are a silhouette many designers have tackled in recent seasons, but the tactile quality of Smith\u2019s velvet versions offered a key point of difference. Fur accents across necklines and the use of a dense, chain mail\u2013esque fabrication on finale pieces contributed to the sensory focus, but the parade of stomping models and no-nonsense attitude said, \u201cLook, but don\u2019t touch.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Laura Garcia", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Trends change faster than the fashion industry does, but it has evolved in ways that benefit niche businesses.

For Fall, Garcia, who designs all of her fabrics in-house, focused on texture over prints, with a special emphasis on burnouts. She showed her first LBD, and introduced really lovely corset tops with half-sleeves festooned with bows that were pure romance. While the lookbook images, many featuring models in flower crowns, make the clothes look a bit twee, on the rack it was easy to imagine them being adaptable to an active, working life. \u201cWhy not wear a dressy dress?\u201d asked Garcia.

The official Westminster Dog Show happened in New York tonight, as luck would have it, and as a lifelong dog lover, Rose decided to host her own version. Along with a dozen models, she cast a variety of pups\u2014some show dogs and some who are famous, like Riley Bean, an orange Brittany with 33,000 Instagram followers. If you\u2019ve frequented Rose\u2019s shows, it wasn\u2019t a huge surprise to see beagles mingling with Dalmatian minis backstage.

Silhouette-wise, Rose is feeling for higher necklines, longer sleeves, and leaner, more body-conscious silhouettes, like a slim camel wool dress and a cherry-red pouf-sleeve blouse with matching high-rise trousers. That look was part of the \u201cNon-Working Group,\u201d announced by a model holding a giant placard (a funny riff on the categories in a dog show: working, toy, hound, non-sporting, et al).

Guests were assembled on benches in classrooms circling the school\u2019s courtyard, and the models walked the perimeter through artificial sunlight. It made for great pictures. We spent yesterday in Paris mostly in the dark with models on runways many yards away; it was frustrating squinting through the gloom. Lemaire and Tran created a more intimate experience, and it served them and their clothes well. Tran described the atmosphere of the show as on \u201ca more daily scale,\u201d which gets exactly at the point. She and Lemaire aren\u2019t interested in runway dramatics or stagey garments of any kind. They make clothes and accessories for daily life: trenches, pantsuits, denim separates, and practical yet distinctive bags and shoes. The developments this season were of the subtle variety, as always. The shirt collars were elongated in a vaguely \u201970s way; the shoulders and sleeves of quilted jackets were puffed as in Victorian times; and the azure blues and reddish browns of midi-length silhouettes apparently referenced the Belgian painter Paul Delvaux. In a collection of mostly monochrome neutrals, the lacquered linen of a pair of coats stood out\u2014they had the sheen of leather. Where this season diverged from their last was in the silhouette, which was longer, neater, and more direct, with less rumpled volume and layering. Lemaire and Tran instructed their \u201ccast of characters\u201d to gaze out into the crowd as they made their perambulations. It reinforced the individuality of the outfits\u2014and the sense that these were pieces that will serve their wearers, not the opposite way around. At this point in the season, we\u2019ve all seen a lot of clothes and wondered about many of them: Where are they going? And who lives like that? Also: What\u2019s the point? Not here.

Takeoff proved smooth enough, with a printed bomber-aviator hybrid over a printed kimono over a printed silk pant. We leveled out into a series of more printed pieces: shirtdresses, long skirts played under sequin tops and shoulder-robed jackets, a long dress under a soft-shouldered blue pin-striped blazer, in which the punchily colored patterns of the season were served on a bed of plainer color and decoration. There were some fun asides in a quilted monochrome \u201clife jacket,\u201d printed neck pillows, and the odd look that came with rolling luggage\u2014Tumi, I think. The collection nosed slowly onward across the map of Leonard\u2019s sort-of-French Etro landscape of internationally sourced decorative tradition deployed from a Euro-luxury point of view.

Maximalists, rejoice! It would be wrong to equate consistency with predictability, however; Johnson Hartig is always evolving his collection, and he really shook things up for Fall 2019 by moving his show from New York to his hometown of Los Angeles. This change was instigated in large part by a collaboration he did with the Jimi Hendrix estate and Fred Segal Sunset. Given unprecedented access to the rock legend\u2019s memorabilia, the designer developed a capsule collection. Mixed in among the Libertine looks were pieces in a changeant lam\u00e9 fabric woven with Hendrix\u2019s handwritten lyrics that Hartig developed. \u201cHendrix was the original libertine,\u201d the designer said. Up there with Hendrix, at least in Hartig\u2019s world, is the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre through whom the designer channeled his existential angst over the environment and the dysfunctional state of politics. Hartig\u2019s no Morrissey; his type of protest sees no merit in wearing black. \u201cI love creating prints, it\u2019s one of my favorite things, and relatively new to me,\u201d the designer said excitedly during a collection preview. Among the patterns of the season was Figgy Pudding, based on a 19th-century botanical; Memento Mori, which mixed Flemish paintings with Ottoman motifs and a rogue Louis Quatorze settee; and the statement-making Being and Nothingness, featuring a a portrait of Jean-Paul Sartre and a reproduction of the Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich\u2019s masterpiece, Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog, with nothing or zilch scattered here and there\u2014words that make sense in relation to existentialism, but which otherwise have absolutely no resonance in Libertine\u2019s universe where everything is more than extra.

As much a visual artist as he is a fashion designer, Sam Linder has a name for this juxtaposition of tropes: self-collage. Articulating key looks backstage, he explained how a canvas-color corduroy blazer and culottes had been folded then sprayed with bleach or paint to create a shadow effect resembling Japanese shibori. Pretty heady stuff, though nicely counterbalanced with ample use of stretch spandex printed with red buffalo plaid. More workwear showed up in an array of moleskin that had been patch-worked with satin, the same satin used for athletic jerseys or in a wisp of a gown spray-stenciled at the neckline using chain necklaces or crystal pearls supplied by Swarovski. A stash of red suede left over from a previous season was turned into a tunic adorned with zippers. Knits were also given the mash-up treatment in the form of snug sweaters rendered in both shaggy alpaca and slick viscose. Accessories, too.

The designer has kept the spirit of modish fashion alive with her A-line shifts and primary colors, but this season, she decided to draw inspiration from a different decade. The aesthetics of the 1970s offered a new playground, with everything from boho chic and disco glamour to choose from, but Perry was careful to select only the themes that could mesh with her existing framework. Change doesn\u2019t need to be jarring; the chic blouses and luxe evening dresses audiences have come to expect from Perry are still there, but they\u2019ve been placed alongside new pieces with muted tones and a slinkier vibe. The shades of mustard and khaki that covered the sequin-striped column gown on model Julia Banas were a departure, as was the introduction of a series of skirts at midi-length. Though the time was right for the gradual evolution, Perry still loves her standards. \u201cI\u2019ll always gravitate towards that looser silhouette,\u201d she shared at her studio, pointing to a pale pink gown. \u201cI do think it\u2019s important to have more options; that\u2019s why we incorporated more of the pleating as a way to create [a look] that showed off more of the body.\u201d Influenced by the decade\u2019s Yves Saint Laurent collections and their liberated themes, Perry offered her own version of body-con. Neutral slip dresses offered in textured stripes and A-line crop tops offered subtle hints of skin.

A huge, happy one, with cartoon rays of pleasure shooting out of it, bobbed up at Loewe, unmistakably carrying the words, Ah! It\u2019s going to be okay! Whether or not Jonathan Anderson has deliberately set out to fill the Phoebe Philo void in fashion, his Fall collection for Loewe stepped in and did that in its own way\u2014without the kind of \u201cOld C\u00e9line\u201d mimicry that has sophisticated women rolling their eyes. The proof: his knack for smoothing away the contradictions between simple, clean silhouettes and craft and texture, between a sense of now and an honoring of history. \u201cIt\u2019s quite strict and crafted,\u201d he said. \u201cCraft under a microscope. It became about reducing things. How do we see silhouette?\u201d In his own JW Anderson show in London, he had talked about \u201cstripping away noise\u201d to concentrate on fashion. The same applied at Loewe: There was no complex set to wander around, no special furniture or literature to try to appreciate\u2014just a black-tiled floor in a white box. Only, on one wall, easily missed in the crush to enter, there was a line of Dutch, French, and English portrait miniatures painted in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. The relationship between these tiny exquisite works of art and the collection was both in the encouragement to look closely and in the tangential free association laced through shapes and fabrics. There were poet\u2019s-sleeve blouses, coats with Puritan collars, severe black waisted coats with leather piping, dresses which started as cream roll-neck sweaters and ended in handkerchief-fine white cotton lawn. You could see something courtly in a sweater smothered in pearls but worn with stiff denim jeans\u2014if you chose to. The finale piece, an incredible white lace-edged dress with zigzagged lappets and pearls pouring from the trumpet sleeves of a black linen coat might indeed have been studied from a portrait of a Cavalier lady\u2014yet on second glance, it was \u201conly\u201d a shirtdress. This is the thing about the creative plane on which Anderson has arrived: What he\u2019s now doing is modern clothing, not costume or \u201cconcept.\u201d The reason the center holds when there\u2019s so much variety going on is that Loewe is grounded in great product\u2014see the coat with the simple chic of the \u201cdripping\u201d collar\u2014with a brilliant frisson of eccentricity tossed in.

Thus was the stage set for the theme of travel, with a soup\u00e7on of nostalgia. Studded black leather referenced the boldness of the \u201980s, when markets were high and hems less so; long, printed dresses spoke of the bohemian \u201970s. The collection closed with a shaggy white jacket that might have been an homage to a favorite furry black number often worn by Kate Moss, who once traveled by Concorde, and was today seated front row alongside Kendall Jenner, Longchamp\u2019s \u201cface.\u201d Still, the boho vibe of the collection evoked an earlier icon of style, \u201csixth Rolling Stone\u201d Anita Pallenberg. Not that she was named as an inspiration; for Fall, creative director Sophie Delafontaine wasn\u2019t interested in a particular destination or person, but in movement itself. \u201cI\u2019m really here to make the woman self-confident,\u201d she said preshow. \u201cI think you can be very strong and stay very feminine.\u201d Delafontaine isn\u2019t out to cater to full-look fashion victims; rather she aims to give women versatile pieces that they can work into their wardrobes and use to play up their singular personalities. To drive that point home, she opted not to have one set beauty-and-hair look for the cast, in order to better celebrate the individuality of each model. This \u201cpiece-y\u201d approach to wardrobing, garment as accent piece, essentially, makes sense for a brand that expanded from accessories into ready-to-wear. Talking about accessories, it\u2019s easy to imagine many \u201ctypes\u201d longing for the mini version of Longchamp\u2019s iconic Le Pliage bag, or the new Voyageuse, with its vanity-case silhouette, that comes in sizes suited for long- or short-haul \u201cflights.\u201d There was no turbulence in this collection, but neither were there flights of fancy. The quality, though, was definitely first-class. For example, Longchamp\u2019s bold new logo, the LGP, which was inspired both by the Bauhaus movement and Manhattan\u2019s geometric grid, appeared on leathers, as a jacquard, and was embroidered on tulle. This collection didn\u2019t only deliver covetable, if safe, iterations of closet classics; looking at it from another plane, the show was a cross-cultural love fest. It turns out that as much as American women admire \u201cthe natural, thoughtless elegance\u201d of the Parisienne, she in turn is energized by the diversity and freedom of New York City and it\u2019s on-the-go women. Here, said Delafontaine, \u201cI feel more in the middle of the world.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Lou Dallas", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Raffaella Hanley envisions each Lou Dallas collection as a dream.

Last season, he landed on the side of the virtual. Today, at the final show of the Fall collections, he cast his eye to the street. Not just any street; at a preview, he called his new Louis Vuitton collection \u201cgeolocated.\u201d The location he had in mind was Beaubourg, the famous Centre Pompidou in the fourth arrondissement, and the large square in front of it, which he described as a \u201cmelting pot of different tribes coming together,\u201d and \u201ca place where expression is free to be.\u201d The idea for this collection was to re-create those various \u201ctribes\u201d or subcultures\u2014before Instagram (and the Internet, more broadly) flattened experience and made us all look the same. It\u2019s a daunting, even quixotic task for the creative leader of a renowned global brand to set for himself\u2014after all, the goal is to get as many people in LV as possible. But Ghesqui\u00e8re seemed to relish the making of this collection, which he said came together in a very fluid way: \u201cWhen I arrived, the question was: \u2018Is Louis Vuitton only about basics?\u2019\u201d Apparently, the sales results are telling him no; customers are buying pieces that are expressive of individuality. The conjuring of those Beaubourg-ian subcultures began today with a re-creation of the Renzo Piano\u2013 and Richard Rogers\u2013designed Centre Pompidou in the Louvre\u2019s Cour Carr\u00e9e\u2014a museum within a museum. (Vuitton will actually donate a part of the set to Piano\u2019s archive.) The models walked the perimeter, with its metal scaffolding and internal workings painted primary colors, in flat boots or thick-soled men\u2019s lace-up shoes, their outfits not a melting pot but a mosaic of clashing textures, prints, punkish metal embellishments, face-framing ruffles (definitely not flat), and leather skullcaps. There\u2019s been a lot of talk this week about bourgeois dress codes\u2014we\u2019ll soon be inundated with camel and culottes. But this was a different view of Paris, backward-looking, in some ways, to the 1980s, yes, but with less prescriptive results. LV clients with a sartorial streak might fancy the tomboyish tailoring. Craftier types will appreciate the quilted floral-print jacket and oversize vest, almost country-ish in their attitude, which qualified as the most surprising elements of the show. For the women who go to Louis Vuitton for its savoir faire with leather, it will be the Damier check pencil skirts. Eclecticism was the collection\u2019s virtue\u2014and its audacity. Sitting at a caf\u00e9 in the fourth arrondissement, or anywhere, you\u2019re going to watch these clothes walk by, not stare into your smartphone."}, {"Designer": "LRS", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Last season, it was difficult to really see the LRS collection in the dimly lit location where the show was held. This time around, designer Raul Solis opted to present his collection by appointment in his Crown Heights studio, which was a treat, since his clothes are fun to see up close. There\u2019s typically a bit of old New York present in his designs, with pieces that seem to be aimed at the type of yesteryear downtown characters that people like to reminisce about. Those throw-it-on, wild qualities were particularly evident this season, as Solis cited the Amy Arbus book On the Street, a collection of downtown street style photographs from the \u201980s: Solis\u2019s lookbook is an Instagram-cast version of that street style melting pot. In the mix was one long-haired model wearing a huge duster coat with a pagan star made out of zippers emblazoned on the chest, jeans paint splattered in lime green, and leather biker boots featuring a shiny metal toe. Solis has a knack for eye-catching footwear: A pair of black pumps with a buckle came with cowboy spurs on the backs. His leatherwork was also strong, including a pair of pants that were patchworked out of colorful leather scraps found in a tannery. One standout piece was a cropped coat that was crafted out of embossed ostrich leather, with a heart-shaped lapel made from red pony hair. At first glance, many of these clothes might seem outlandish, but there is a classic method to how Solis works. He maintains elegant elements, like draping, which he applied by delicately stringing metal chains across miniskirts or trousers. One thing he should note: In his lookbook lineup, there was a model dressed in Native American\u2013style garb with cow bone decorations scaling down the chest of a jacket. (Solis did add that he bought the cow bone from a Native American jewelry dealer.) While he may view this as another colorful New York character, many people may not.

Sure, the show had the \u201cviciousness\u201d Lopez recalled of those girls, a certain strut that conveyed the attitude \u201cI know who I am, and what I\u2019ve got.\u201d But the clothes on the runway had hinted at another story: This collection, much more streamlined, accessible, and elevated than Luar outings past, was heavily indebted to classic menswear. He was playing with the idea of suiting. There were button-downs and cable knits and pinstripes and glen plaids. For a brand so adamantly anti-binary, it made for a notable change of pace. And then you got it. This is what the end of patriarchy looks like: Fierce fatales of whatever gender making a glorious mess of the old male power structure codes. Trying them on, making them their own. It made for some truly eye-catching looks, like the tennis-skirt-trouser hybrids in plaid, with tiers of rigid pleats down one leg, or a trenchcoat covered in a film of glossy black mesh, or a \u201csuit\u201d comprised of a deconstructed pinstripe jacket and matching leg-warmer-y things with long flags of fabric attached at the calf. Many of the looks here were retail-friendly, in particular the patchwork fur, the handkerchief-hem skirts, and zip-detailed pants, and lots of people will be clamoring for the Luar belt-handled satchels, with clear plastic bags just the right size to hold a set of keys and a phone. But some ensembles did make you wonder: Must all the revolutions happen at once? Might not a dress, for example, still cover an ass? That\u2019s a niggling complaint, given that Lopez made a huge leap here, in terms of thinking through the practicality of his clothes.

Those graceful, long dresses having had their debuts, this was a chance to expand her repertoire beyond weddings, red carpets, and other one-off events. The designer, who works with her daughter Lucilla on the collection, opened with a peacock blue faux-fur coat and matching jeweled hat worn over a shirtdress in a floral print that conjured Claude Monet\u2019s Giverny. These were day clothes, but in the same romantic spirit as the occasion dresses Beccaria has long specialized in. She cut a pantsuit in a gray-green tartan, and though the pants were hip-slung and straight, the jacket had puffed sleeves, and it topped a pussy bow blouse. The results were sweet, not strict, a sensibility accentuated by the tiny flowers embroidered on a pair of tartan coats. From a distance, those little blooms looked like snow. There were also charming mohair sweaters shown belted over wispy skirts and knee-high suede boots. Of course, Beccaria didn\u2019t ignore special occasion dresses altogether. The prettiest of the bunch was in a pale shade of blush with a print of hand-painted flowers. One caveat: Beccaria lavishes great care on her delicate confections; in a world of mass-produced stuff they seem made with intention.

With a trio of well-cited fashion legends on the moodboard\u2014Jane Birkin, Ali MacGraw, and Diane Keaton\u2014Lee and her team developed a collection that ticks all the boxes of a pragmatic woman\u2019s wardrobe.

But with Yuni Ahn\u2019s recent appointment as the creative director of a label more recognized for its music production and fox mascot than for insider-y fashion, there might now be reason to reconsider. In her first role since leaving Celine as design director, Ahn made her Maison Kitsun\u00e9 debut this evening, which also marked the brand\u2019s entrance on the official Paris calendar. Apropos of its Friday evening time slot, the presentation was cohosted by Boiler Room, a popular music platform for techno enthusiasts, with music provided by Paris DJ du jour, Kiddy Smile. Founders Gildas Loa\u00ebc and Masaya Kuroki might be in the midst of upgrading the brand\u2019s positioning\u2014and expanding its worldwide presence\u2014but kudos for sticking to their club-culture roots with this coming-out. Anyway, Ahn revealed she was (maybe still is) a club kid, too. What initially struck Loa\u00ebc, however, was her focus, saying, \u201cShe brings so much savoir faire; she has a really precise eye.\u201d And she also blurred the line between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s collections by proposing unisex layers that lent a streamlined coherence to the look. \u201cThe feeling of being modern comes from choosing the right fabric and the right shape,\u201d she explained, her inky-blue technical blazer with its relaxed tailoring and drawstring waist effectively catching the eye. Back onstage, androgynous models made clear that the brand had graduated from Parisian preppy to global urban. A high-shine black trenchcoat, Prince of Wales down jackets, monochromatic workwear layers, an overall \u201990s influence, and chunky sneakers in collaboration with Brandblack all signaled Maison Kitsun\u00e9 2.0. The brand\u2019s status sweatshirts still looked relevant; only now they featured thick web straps and a tone-on-tone logo\u2014and were shown under a dressy black puffer coat or as a hoodie dress. The cute fox became a kool fox, which was literally spelled out on a graphic jacquard sweater and polo. Ahn gave the girls a smart update on the Lavalli\u00e8re shirt by transforming the bow into an integrated bandana, and wasn\u2019t afraid to elevate looks with enlarged volumes and high-heeled footwear in collaboration with Michel Vivien. Brand reboots can be risky, but truth be told, Maison Kitsun\u00e9 had mostly outgrown its look. Anh\u2019s challenge will be to keep this minimalist cool from creeping towards Uniqlo while also avoiding watered-down old Celine. \u201cI can\u2019t help being that woman,\u201d she conceded of that latter. \u201cI put myself in deeply, so in that way, it is there.

It\u2019s as if we\u2019re witnessing fashion charting the desperate global landscape before our eyes this season as we spectate on shows that choose between those either-or routes. At Maison Margiela, however, John Galliano\u2019s compass is set to gyrate between the two. What can come after decadence? Austerity, of course. To the strains of Swan Lake. That was the impact of his fall intro: the sudden shock of calm, coherence, and beautifully constructed coats. After his summer haute couture show, Artisanal, in which jolting, eye-confusing, giant blue poodle-d excess practically tossed the idea of recognizable garments over the side, he took a 180-degree ready-to-wear turn in the direction of sober tailoring. That sounds basic, but thumbs up, it was amazing. Tailoring\u2014coats, trouser suits, skirtsuits\u2014is indubitably on fashion\u2019s agenda this season. That already sets a competition running for who can be the first to grab a customer\u2019s commitment to investing in this new-yet-trad form of garb. It takes a designer with an arsenal of hands-on skills in their repertoire, like Galliano, to pull it off and yet still look like themselves. He can take shears to cut a slightly waisted, charcoal-gray double-breasted herringbone coat and implant it with wide, black, felted sleeves seemingly culled from masculine militaria, and then clinch its desirability with what Savile Row tailors term a pronounced \u201cshoulder roll.\u201d He can also cut in the upside down and the inside out, leave the shadows of one garment on another and fillet skirts (or trenchcoats, or whatever they may have been) so that only the framework of former hems swings free below the knee. The many tedious descriptors for that class of inventiveness comes down to this: You know it when you see it. But who is seeing? The eyes of the millennials and Gen Z-ers who hero-worship Galliano today might recognize themselves in the way he has lifted aspirations, erasing the commonplaces of streetwear and gender categorizations they grew up with. With his crew of student interns on work placement from his alma mater, Central Saint Martins, Galliano\u2019s inclusive gang-sourced intel is sparking that new energy. He called this a \u201cco-ed\u201d collection and (again) opened it with the trans teenage Londoner Finn Buchanan. This time, he was wearing a plain black, knee-length single-breasted coat with sloping shoulders, black rubber Mary Janes, and old-lady stocking socks. Ticking off who was where on the sliding scale of gender identity felt idiotically redundant (beside the point, old!) as Galliano\u2019s suiting\u2014belted, high-heeled, and trailing tailor\u2019s tacks\u2014kept coming. Non-binary is a watchword within gender politics today. If only it could be embraced beyond the example set by youth, beyond the fashion community which celebrates it, and into politics, we might get somewhere.

Their praise surely reflected the fact that, for the duration of the collection, he was able to hold their attention with feeling and with fashion. On models that were youthful and mature, professionals and pals, he presented couture and ready-to-wear looks along with his first foray into menswear as a single body of work that had a calming effect even at its most vibrant\u2014hello, hot pink taffeta and deep purple satin! This was established from the opening look, a white shirt that belied its simple appearance with grosgrain detailing applied by hand, and ample black pants that couldn\u2019t have been better tailored. The shirt sleeves, slit open and wafting backward, demonstrated a key Kayrouz tenet: Let the body breathe. Further to that point, an ample abaya shape for women and a djellaba for men were interpreted as architectural, all-purpose overlayers, especially in trenchcoat cotton. In shape, they were self-contained; in attitude, they projected self-care. Contoured knitwear dresses were repeated throughout the lineup mainly because Kayrouz says he\u2019s eager to explore the category anew. Ultra-light taffeta, meanwhile, was classic Kayrouz through and through\u2014the only difference here was that the dressiness was dialed down with daywear in order to be enjoyed more often. Likewise the tulle embroidered with stars that could be worn as a base layer. Unsurprisingly, the most labor-intensive pieces\u2014yes, the veritable couture\u2014were those in gold. They looked woven but were actually assembled from ribbon, and the dresses required 150 to 200 hours of work.

The Japanese designer held three exquisite runway shows, each an hour apart, with the restorative air of an afternoon go\u00fbter. There\u2019s a transcendental romanticism and spiritualism to her work, which feels uniquely Japanese in its ties both to nature and centuries-old craft traditions. A few months ago, Kurogouchi had been exploring a cave in Japan\u2019s Saga Prefecture, where she unearthed several broken shards of painted blue and white porcelain from the Edo period. They reminded her of the diary project she had begun last season, in her attempt to \u201cfind beautiful small things in my daily life,\u201d she said. \u201cThose fragments made me think of my own fragments of memories.\u201d In tracking those moments, Kurogouchi also drew a connection between the ceramics and other blues flitting in and out of view: the pile of navy and turquoise Edo-era silks that she had just bought at an antiques shop in Nara; the color of her favorite bath salts, which she had begun photographing as they dissolved abstractly in water; the catalog of Seizure by British artist Roger Hiorns on her shelf. Thus Kurogouchi began with those blues\u2014a rich navy coat that looked like leather from afar but up close was revealed to be a shiny jacquard, alongside silk turtleneck blouses with full, floating sleeves. The designer is so elegant in her references to her native Japan. It\u2019s the simple suggestion of a lace collar layered beneath a kimono-like wrap, the subtle asymmetry in the vertical line of an ornate jacquard robe woven with gold thread, itself a reference to kinran belts. See the royal blue Victoriana knit dress with such thickly layered sleeves they could be peeled back like rose petals. \u201cThose sleeves were actually inspired by dumplings!\u201d Kurogouchi said, laughing. She gestured to a version in delicate off-white, whose rippling lines did recall the curved ridges of a gyoza. As with last season, the standout dresses featured a rich tapestry of textures and colors and patterns, many of which were made by longtime kimono craftsmen. Think: a plunging checked silk gown with hand-embroidered bell sleeves, white quilted silk cuffs, and a lace lining that floated down the runway. All the lovely little watercolor blooms had been hand-painted by Kurogouchi herself, a reference to those bits of broken porcelain.

Since launching their wildly popular bucket bags in 2012, Floriana Gavriel and Rachel Mansur have cycled through just about every fashion presentation format, from quiet showroom appointments to blowout fashion shows and back again. With the infrastructure for its see-now-buy-now accessories business firmly in place, Mansur Gavriel has been steadily scaling back on the scope of its Fashion Week happenings. Today it celebrated the arrival of Fall 2019 with an event at the brand\u2019s store on Wooster Street in SoHo. \u201cWhen we shot our first campaign, we only had a few hundred bucks to produce the images, so we basically used fruit as props,\u201d says Mansur, leaning against stands of pineapples, peaches, and oranges piled high in the space. \u201cThis installation was really a nod to where we started.\u201d With attendees sipping on watermelon juice as they perused the new Mansur Gavriel wares, the mood in the store was part farmers market, part shopping party.

Still, the brand\u2019s knack for making best-selling accessories has yet to be matched by its clothing. Priced at just under $500, the chunky daisy-knit sweater is destined to be more of a sleeper hit, primed for that rare fashion-forward millennial who invests in a winter wardrobe months in advance. The brand\u2019s highly Instagrammable fruit installation will be open to the public for the next few days, and it is sure to attract attention in an area that is swarming with tourists in search of the perfect downtown selfie.

Buyers weren\u2019t thrilled about the slightly higher price points of her softer, earthier new pieces, nor were they entirely convinced that it was important to support organic fabrics and low-impact production. Hoffman was unwavering, though, and somewhat prophetic: In 2019, sustainability has become one of the biggest conversations in fashion. You can\u2019t go off about climate change on Twitter and then design clothes made from plastic and toxic dyes. Designers continue to follow Hoffman\u2019s lead, and on Monday night she\u2019s being honored by New York Fashion Week and Repreve (which makes fabric out of recycled plastic bottles) as a Champion of Sustainability. It\u2019s a big deal to get that kind of recognition, and, considering Hoffman\u2019s influence on the movement, you could say it\u2019s been a long time coming. But the designer remains extremely careful about how she discusses sustainability, both in real life and on her Instagram. She doesn\u2019t want her customers to feel like they\u2019re being preached to, and she wouldn\u2019t dream of stripping the clothes of all their fun and fantasy, either. When you\u2019re considering a pair of Hoffman\u2019s jeans (made from hemp!) or a slinky dress in Tencel (an ultra-soft fiber derived from wood), it\u2019s ultimately still an emotional purchase. Rather than shout about all of her good intentions, she\u2019s working on lessening her footprint in ways you\u2019ll never see or hear about: In addition to the natural and recycled fabrics she sourced for Fall 2019, she reported that the entire collection was smaller than usual, a concerted effort to reduce waste. Typically, a percentage of items never get produced, but sampling them is a high-cost, high-impact process. The biggest surprises for Fall were the items in a sheer, diaphanous Tencel, like the pale pink tiered skirt and long-sleeved tee that opened the lookbook. They felt a bit more romantic and old world than Hoffman\u2019s usual fare\u2014the zip-front denim dresses and buffalo-check blazers will be more familiar to her fans\u2014and it was nice to see something new and different in a low-key showroom appointment. It\u2019s a treat to see the clothes one-on-one with Hoffman, but it helps to watch the clothes come alive, particularly on the diverse lineup of models and dancers Hoffman tends to cast.

Grand shapes were back again for Fall, but this time Jacobs was looking in the mirror, rather than at the couturiers of old. His repertoire is full of cloth coats and capes, of shredded tulle party dresses, of A-line skirts and crewnecks, of Prince of Wales pantsuits. Only here, in many cases, they were taken to extremes, the coats and capes pumped up with air, the dresses made more expressive with layers of crinolines. Stephen Jones\u2013designed hats on nearly every model added inches to their stature. The feeling the show conjured was one of tenderness. It was partly the intimate setup\u2014just 180 seats\u2014and partly the models\u2019 slow procession through the spotlit dark, but mostly it came down to that sense of the unfamiliar familiar, like d\u00e9ja vu, but different.

Academy Mansion served as the backdrop this time, and the designers transported curving vines and lush florals to create the look of an enchanted forest. Those vines were mirrored in the dresses, turning up in winding embroidery motifs and often ending in curvy bows. The idea of forest greenery influenced a hand-painted fern motif, which was then translated into a dense embroidery, and a few gowns even had birds hidden in all the handwork. More broadly speaking, the volumes felt scaled up\u2014even for a \u201cball gown brand\u201d\u2014and there was more surface treatment than ever, including fluffy 3-D appliqu\u00e9s, stiff tiered ruffles, hand-painted watercolor prints, and bits of feathers here and there. \u201cMajor\u201d is something Marchesa does well, so what felt really new was the continued focus on daywear, from embroidered poplin blouses to tailored pants and a white lace shirtdress dotted with big peonies.

One of his images reveals every tiny ruffle of an iris petal, for instance; in others, the flowers become so abstract, they start to look like something else entirely. The concept inspired the precise, XXL embroidered flowers on a few A-line gowns as well as the softer, less literal watercolor print on a gleaming satin number. Beane\u2019s ability to create texture in his photos informed the abundance of swirling, tightly pleated rosettes seen on a lagoon-blue party dress and a two-tiered crimson gown, which had major red carpet potential (though you\u2019re more likely to see Marchesa couture at the Oscars next weekend). In recent seasons, glittering pleated Lurex dresses became something of a Notte signature and lent themselves especially well to young women shopping for weddings or prom. For fall, Chapman and Craig took a slightly more refined approach to shine: There were silver floral column gowns in embossed silk, a few simple cocktail dresses with star-dusted tulle overlays, and a standout burgundy frock with splashes of rose-gold.

It marked his label\u2019s 10-year anniversary, which he wanted to celebrate with a show \u201cfull of all my favorite things, what I really like as a designer and what makes me love my job.\u201d De Vincenzo zeroed in on his personal bests in a focused rendition of his creative vocabulary, stripped to its essence and injected with a sense of ease and lightness. It made for a compelling exercise in setting his style record straight, something he hasn\u2019t always achieved. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of randomness or kitsch,\u201d he said. Yet randomness here was contained within a less haphazard, more orderly perimeter, while the aggressive edges of kitsch were smoothed into eccentric, retro-tinged whimsy. De Vincenzo has always favored a rather precise repertoire: psychedelia; Lurex; glitter- and metallic-textured surfaces; graphic optical motifs reflecting his love of kinetic art and Bridget Riley. The streetwear craze is looked at with a certain froideur. He veers instead toward a twisted bourgeois flair and \u201cdistorted ladylike,\u201d as he calls it. In this collection, he riffed on his evergreens, blending what could have been a cacophony into a cohesive medley. Dresses had a \u201950s feminine silhouette, with a cinched waist, flared pliss\u00e9 skirt, and off-the-shoulder d\u00e9colletage. What jolted them off-kilter were the incongruous laminated wavy surfaces onto which light bounced and played, distorting the perception of shapes and colors. Adding to the psychedelic/bourgeois effect were plush faux fur stoles, fascinators, and crystal-studded veils. De Vincenzo\u2019s take on the Chanel suit was an abstract-pattern knitted lam\u00e9 rendition, worn with glittery high-tops and a very ladylike handbag. Tailoring was addressed by a masculine city coat in checkered lam\u00e9, while the party theme (ubiquitous in Milan this season) was covered by a sexy strapless pliss\u00e9 number in glittery rainbow lam\u00e9. They both looked pretty cool, as did a series of faux fur hyper-furry chubbies in bright colors suspended on crystal straps. \u201cIt\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve got to a sweatshirt,\u201d mused the designer."}, {"Designer": "Margaret Howell", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Here\u2019s a little confession: During the recent New York shows, colleagues and I took to saying, after some show where someone had been too complicated, or overly referential, or pretentious, \u201cJust make clothes.\u201d Sounds so easy, doesn\u2019t it? Just. Make. Clothes. Of course, it\u2019s not easy, at all, especially given the mercurial relationship that so many of us now have with what we want to wear and what we want to buy. Correct me if I am wrong here\u2014and I\u2019m truly happy to be proved otherwise\u2014but has fashion ever been more tricky to navigate? It\u2019s everything about it. The looks that seem to last a nanosecond, hooking us on to the new new thing. The proliferation of (there is no other word) product. And, the increasing (and rightful) rising awareness of the environmental impact of our mad need for more, more, and yet more. No one could ever accuse Margaret Howell of not making clothes, but there\u2019s no \u201cjust\u201d about them. They come layered\u2014literally and metaphorically\u2014with so many associations and triggers: Englishness, craft, respect, utility, consideration, tradition, purpose, and a tangible sense of a future. The latter might surprise some who see Howell as a wonderful purveyor of nostalgia, a designer of misty-eyed remembrances of the past. Not so. Her coed show for Fall 2019, held yet again in the Rambert dance space on London\u2019s South Bank, demonstrated how you can take everything you do and stand for, yet still be clear-sighted about what\u2019s needed now\u2014and next. Once again, this was a terrific showing of clothes; clothes that looked like they\u2019d stick around, clothes that weren\u2019t hung up on gender distinctions, clothes that felt like they could be personalized to a point that they\u2019d really feel like yours. An interesting side note to this: Howell has always been a lover of the carefully considered styling flourish, but this season it often felt like the models had actually just put on what they were wearing themselves and figured out how they\u2019d actually want to wear them: the casual rolling of the ankles of ecru cotton drill pants; the cinching of trouser waistbands with sturdy belts; silken scarves trailing from back pockets, a deliciously fey touch in contrast with the slouchier, oversize, and casual feel of the pieces they were worn with. Those proportions are key, particularly to the great outerwear that was on show: functional/utilitarian coats with breast pockets in black or army green; blazers in brown corduroy or earthy check tweeds, cut with a slope to the shoulders, irrespective of gender; and, the standout, black waxed-cotton anoraks and bomber jackets. These were variously worn with white or salmon pink cotton shirting, ivory sweaters and olive cardigans, and pleated skirts in a graphic 2-D leaf print. Clothes, in other words. And truly effortless, real, and desirable clothes, at that."}, {"Designer": "Marina Moscone", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Last September, Marina Moscone\u2019s Spring 2019 presentations at Willem de Kooning\u2019s former apartment and studio got her a lot of buzz. But Fall felt like something of a breakthrough. In a presentation held in The Strand\u2019s Rare Book Room, Moscone said she\u2019d wanted to tell more of a story through her clothes (hence the wall-to-wall books by the world\u2019s greatest authors). It\u2019s taken a few seasons for her to get here\u2014let\u2019s consider Moscone\u2019s prior collections a prologue of sorts\u2014and one of the biggest steps for the designer was simply getting to know the women who buy her clothes. The casting in her Fall show was an apt reflection of her customer, whom Moscone described as elegant, artful, and\u2014importantly\u2014\u201cmature.\u201d In addition to the diverse range of twentysomething women on her runway, she tapped a few major names who are 40 or over: Missy Rayder wore a gently oversize suit in thick black satin with heeled boots; Natane Boudreau modeled a long-sleeved jersey dress with a ray of draped crimson silk; and Amy Wesson\u2019s look combined a lace slip dress, a textural gray knit, and flat ankle boots. \u201cMy clients are women like them and like me,\u201d Moscone said. \u201cWe want to be able to find beautiful clothes that have purpose, and where you know there\u2019s a handmade, tactile element.\u201d Texture was a big story, the surprises being a nubby coat made from a repurposed moving blanket and a few knit dresses that had been laboriously hand-embroidered to mimic the same effect. Those pieces were vaguely reminiscent of Phoebe Philo\u2019s Fall 2013 collection for Celine, which kick-started an industry-wide exploration of fluffy, homey materials. Moscone was careful to juxtapose all of that surface treatment with lots of glossy, sculptural satin, seen best on a strapless, nipped-waist LBD with a subtle curve at the hip. Styled with knee-high burgundy boots, it felt like a timely alternative to the cocktail-dress-and-heels combination. Ditto the strapless tunic over trousers, an evolution of similar looks from Spring. There was great texture in the melon corduroy suits, too, which were among the more casual pieces Moscone has done. Still, she insisted much of the line could be worn a variety of ways, day or night (unlike the massive evening gowns she used to design). The sleek, elegant boots helped to underline that; they\u2019ll be popular with retailers, and will speak to women of all ages who are craving something a bit hardier than a stiletto."}, {"Designer": "Marine Serre", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Clad in a fleecy leopard jacket, her eyelids flashing with a vivid electric blue, Marine Serre is talking in the gloom of her subterranean show venue, a former wine cellar on the outermost edges of Paris, about her Fall 2019 collection, titled Radiation. It was a stomping yet soaring vision of warriors from the future emerging from the pitch blackness in seamed leather coats, sculpted parkas, and achingly romantic paneled dresses trailing psychedelic pastel-hued scarves and fronds of fake fur, under which were worn head-to-toe bodysuits\u2014bodysuits which suggested surrendering to inner kink as much as they did protection from the elements. \u201cIt\u2019s after the apocalypse; a group of friends are underground\u2014a community coming together,\u201d Serre said. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe zone in which a new world is being created, a future world, and a new way to see fashion.\u201d If you are stuck in the depths after everything has gone to hell, community building, let me give you a word of advice: Serre is precisely the kind of fearless and industrious individual you\u2019d be mightily glad to have around. (And if you happened to be in a working wine cellar, so much the better, right?) Ever since her first runway show a mere one year ago, she has proved herself to be a designer who is highly adept at forging a new idea of fashion, one that\u2019s sustainable, accountable, and, given her considerable talents, pretty darn remarkable. The thing with Serre is this: She never flinches from confronting what\u2019s going on in the world through her work, yet she retains an essential optimism about what might transpire once we\u2019re in a (hopefully) better place. Like several others this season, she plunged herself into darkness, groping around for a way out into the light at a time when everyone is clearly beset with doing the same. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a new belief,\u201d she went on to say. \u201cI feel this collection is a bit hard because, to have a new belief, you have to be hard.\u201d It was harder than past seasons, for sure, and even more accomplished than her previous efforts; this one played out like she\u2019d pushed herself to the extreme. Consider the way she nimbly nipped and sliced plaid into an hourglass-waisted coat or suit; the transforming of granny-plaid scarves into a strapless minidress or a poncho that was just shy of trailing the floor; and yet more of her fetish-y black stretch bodysuits, covered with gleaming and glinting detritus of life\u2014microchips, coins, the stuff we (let\u2019s be honest) foolishly hold dear. One of the latter was worn by the towering and strikingly handsome artist Vladimir McCrary, who used to walk Jean Paul Gaultier\u2019s runways back in the day. Serre certainly shares Gaultier\u2019s unerring ability to hone in on cultural expression and subversion, but with her first four looks, there was another designer on her mind: Karl Lagerfeld. He was someone she admired enormously, she said, \u201cfor his joy, his irony, the support he gave to me; he was remarkable\u2014working for 60 years, having fun, and making people laugh but also having serious conversations, too. It was important to honor him.\u201d Respect is rarely a quality mentioned when talking about the talent of designers, but it should be, and Serre has plenty of both."}, {"Designer": "Markus Lupfer", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Out with the sheerness.

To get some fresh air into the collection,\u201d said Lupfer this afternoon. Moving stuff out allows you to bring in the new, and this season he focused hard on mono-color looks of many layers. On a foundation of Salomon geek sneaks, he built ensembles of long pleated skirts, voluminously sleeved rib-knit Italian cashmere sweaters, and variations of the parka and duffle coat with faux fur trims cut in hard-wearing wool from AW Hainsworth of West Yorkshire. These were sometimes accented by fringed scarves, or extra sweaters, or featured restrained-for-Lupfer crystal and enamel embellishments. The colors were uncomplicated; scarlet, navy, white, black. There were some asides into pattern and quirk. Skirts, bombers, and parkas came in leopard faux fur; there was a pretty desert-flower print on a skirt and dress. A cute horizontally whiskered cat portrait was a rare intarsia incursion into the monochrome knits. Crazily oversize faux fur mittens looked like intervention garments for applying a digital detox. We\u2019d seen oversize trapper hats elsewhere pretty recently, but they spoke to this context too.

And so how fitting that today, at his Fall 2019 presentation, the label\u2019s creative director, Francesco Risso, offered a show about pleasure without guilt\u2014or as he put it: \u201cHereticism but on a different level.\u201d His premise, which he titled Neuroerotik, is that women\u2019s lives are governed by two forces: the promise of the cerebral to imagine past what is known, and the insistent drive of hormones and chromosomes, pushing us toward sensual experiences our brains don\u2019t want to comprehend. It\u2019s the rational versus the irrational but with a deliciously kinky and optimistic twist. Both tendencies, in Risso\u2019s view, allow one to \u201cmap new pleasure-scapes\u201d\u2014and how cool is that? \u201cJust imagine that from today you start putting a tape on your knee,\u201d said Risso backstage while putting finishing touches on his pleat-wearing, chain-slung, scarf-dragging sexual warriors, \u201cand that becomes your erogenous point instead of your nipple . . .\u201d So many possibilities open up when you can train your mind to see a knee as a nipple. It means that red, black, and white panels that bear no relationship to one another size-wise are connected only by rows of disused wedding rings. It means that the dropped sleeves of a swaggering coat might not actually be connected to the body of the coat, but a second layer with a quirky humor all its own. It means that what appears a graphic and garish modular pattern when seen from a great distance might reveal a face or a classical rose print. It might mean that your long sleeved gown of red silk, slashed in back but still cozy like a night dress, is covered in piercings and more rings, although these resemble the embellishments of, well, piercings and not discarded unions. Everything in this Marni collection involved some sort of duality\u2014the chain harness was both silver and gold, the skirt had two waistlines, the jacket was a bolero . . . or not. The best pieces were the ones that contained their contradictions with ease: the pieced dresses with a scarf tie at the neck, the long retro numbers in charmeuse with their elegant tucks and knee-grazing chains (ooh\u2014watch those nipples!), the pixelated polka dot gowns. This was not an easy collection, and it wasn\u2019t delivered with a soft touch. The soundtrack veered from The Shining to a number by Kas Product that featured a shrieking cat. The boots and shoes were massive, sometimes studded\u2014the footwear of storms and storminess more generally. But there was also something moving, and unfathomably chic, about Risso\u2019s neurotic, erotic vision. In some ways, he seemed to be fashioning a response to these dark times, much as Miuccia Prada did earlier this week. She defined romance as an ideal of goodness and agency in a monstrous moment. For her, romance provides the narrative escape routes we need to think both through and past the totalitarian present. For Risso, the curious twists of the mind are our bulwark against anything proscribed or preordained; our brains and our passions will, in his view, set us free. It\u2019s empowering and wild, which, one could argue, is the whole point of fashion."}, {"Designer": "Marta Jakubowski", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Marta Jakubowski quoted from the French feminist writer H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous in her program notes, which caused some postshow scrambling to catch up on her post-structuralist theory. It seems, though one may stand corrected, that the reason Jakubowski\u2019s models had exotic flowers in their mouths was tied to a line from Cixous\u2019s \u201cThe Laugh of the Medusa\u201d: \u201cShe spits Anthuriums. She will not be silenced.\u201d Truth told, you wished she hadn\u2019t felt the need to go that literal, because it was a distraction from some of the interesting, layered, wrapped cutting that was going on. It acted as London\u2019s first commentary on the much-anticipated comeback of tailoring for women, a mirroring of the movement that has gained momentum in the men\u2019s shows. So does she feel it\u2019s a time for tailoring? \u201cI always feel it\u2019s time for tailoring!\u201d She laughed. \u201cI wanted to go back and concentrate on what I like and enjoy.\u201d Jakubowski, who is Polish-born, received her first training at a highly technical German fashion school before finishing her studies in form at the Royal College of Art. German-trained pattern cutters have a reputation for excellence and precision\u2014and that skill has given Jakubowski the ability to take her shears to reinventing coats, jackets, and pantsuits. In a way, it puts her on the same page as some of the designers in New York who\u2019ve been slicing coats into panels, and of Kim Jones, who swathed a sash across his men\u2019s coats. She said she wanted to \u201cshow that women can\u2019t be stereotyped\u201d\u2014a pushback, no doubt, against the clich\u00e9 of career power-suiting. Some of it erred on the side of too much complication\u2014ease of wear is a prime source of empowerment, after all\u2014but Jakubowski is to be commended for turning to explore this long-neglected subject."}, {"Designer": "Martin Grant", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Not only was the late Lee Radziwill one of Martin Grant\u2019s early supporters, the two developed a friendship that lasted more than 20 years. \u201cShe\u2019s always a part of it somewhere,\u201d the designer said during a showroom visit. \u201cThe test point became: Would she like it or not?\u201d Radziwill never missed a show, and she would tell Grant exactly what she thought. \u201cShe went through every period, and she would wear them all\u2014even Zandra Rhodes, if you can imagine,\u201d he recalled. Grant reckons Radziwill might have liked his \u201960s-inflected white blouson with mirror leather trim for Fall. But overall he decided on a looser vibe. Take, for example, the reversible trench with black-and-white check on one side, bonded with a glossy russet coating on the flip side. \u201cI wanted something that was a little more dynamic,\u201d the designer explained. That same check returned on A-line skirts and in a cropped bomber. Further along, he decided to amp things up a bit, pairing a russet duchesse satin pantsuit with a violet sequined shell, or else showing that shimmering shell with a fuchsia pantsuit. Improbable as it sounds, it worked. Grant is a poised, considered designer: His sharp suit shot through with Lurex is the kind of piece that never goes out of style. Ditto the wisp of an asymmetrical silver top. So it came as something of a surprise to see him working a harder, frankly impertinent edge. A handful of numbers with petrol-finish sequins were smart, sophisticated, and flattering; the shocker of a punch line came in a one-shoulder/one-leg catsuit. \u201cIt takes me back to Debbie Harry days,\u201d the designer joked. Throw on that burgundy shearling coat and you\u2019re ready to hit the town. Radziwill it was not. \u201cShe was always very positive, but would have found that one completely ridiculous,\u201d Grant said with a laugh."}, {"Designer": "Mary Katrantzou", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Mary Katrantzou worked with the themes of elemental natural forces for her Fall collection. \u201cEarth, air, fire, water.\u201d Perhaps this theme was important to know, perhaps not so much. The most apparent thing about her collections these days is how much Katrantzou has become a demi-couturier. Her show, with its rainbow color palette and exuberant use of ruffles and ostrich feathers seemed to place her somewhere in line with the social history of British couture\u2014a decorative mantle passed on by the likes of Zandra Rhodes and the London dressmakers of the \u201970s and \u201980s. Except in Katrantzou\u2019s time, her line reaches a far more internationally based clientele, some of whom collect her work, season by season as souvenirs of her themes, almost as they also buy works of art. Strangely, then, the most extravagant pieces in this collection can be judged as her most commercial\u2014such as the intensely beaded, multicolored dresses smothered in swirlingly collaged motifs of flowers and vegetation.

You can practically see the wish lists materializing over their heads as they rave about the collection; perhaps it\u2019s because the clothes are modeled on dynamic, diverse women who actually look like them (including Susan Cianciolo, Paloma Elsesser, and Hailey Benton Gates), or maybe it\u2019s because the show gives them a dozen new ideas for mixing pieces that shouldn\u2019t work together but somehow do. Consider today\u2019s fleece zip-up cinched with a low-slung belt over a pleated skirt; the electric blue leopard coat over a crinkly silk skirt and jogger sweats; the fringed and beaded sweater tucked into an iridescent plaid pencil skirt and zebra-striped boots. The effect was of a grab-and-go, can\u2019t-stop-to-check-the-mirror process of getting dressed, which ultimately comes across as brazen confidence; you imagine a woman so comfortable with her style she never second-guesses herself. Zadeh called it \u201chand-picked dressing, like when you\u2019re scouring for vintage finds and putting together this mix of different elements.\u201d She\u2019s built a cult around that high-low, rules-are-for-squares mentality. On one hand, you could say it\u2019s all just a mash-up of clothes that intentionally don\u2019t make sense. But the bigger picture is that Zadeh has given women permission to dress intuitively and maybe to fuck things up a little. In a world of carefully crafted Instagram outfits and brands that tout minimalism to the point of groupthink\u2014All you need are these three items, and you\u2019ll never shop again!\u2014you find yourself craving a little \u201coddness,\u201d as Zadeh puts it. A picture-perfect look is flat and lifeless; her models in Technicolor blouses, python boots, and schoolgirl skirts, on the other hand, look like the creative, self-possessed women you want to be. Where does it all come from, you ask? The references Zadeh listed read like a stream of consciousness: \u201cIt\u2019s primitive nomad [meets] Annie Hall, harlequin watercolors, working women, elements of safari . . . and fashion at the turn of the century, when women started to introduce sports into their wardrobes.\u201d In simpler terms: The show began with natural, vaguely earthy looks and ended with neon, almost clownish dresses, puffers, and underpinnings. (That\u2019s where the harlequin thing came in; strangely, Dior and Givenchy were on the same wavelength for couture.) Many of those looks were meant to be challenging, but Zadeh pointed out that the pieces themselves were actually quite \u201cnormal.\u201d They were button-downs, midi skirts, and pegged trousers, just in unexpected materials and colors. \u201cThe shapes are really timeless, but the fabrications are what make them special,\u201d she said. \u201cMy background is in textiles, so I\u2019m always looking for materials that feel new and are hard to find.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Matty Bovan", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Be it upside down, inside out, lopsided, poufed-up, or layered with crafty non sequiturs, what Matty Bovan does has cast a spell over London fashion. Somehow, there\u2019s an indomitably sunny capacity for hands-on, craft-y enjoyment in his character, which breaks through in his collections\u2014but then again, it\u2019s always against the murky background of contemporary British reality as he lives it, up in York, his hometown in the North. This time, his concoction was a brew of Brexit with a handful of medieval witchcraft, and a pinch of anger thrown in: \u201cAn ode to England, really.\u201d He said he\u2019d been triggered by receiving a flyer for cut-price furniture through his letterbox. It was addressed to his late grandmother, whose house he\u2019s now working in. \u201cIt had this headline, \u2018In Uncertain Times, This Is a Cert!\u2019 which I thought was so disgusting and perverse and hilarious, I had to use it for this collection.\u201d Bovan\u2019s Liberty-fabric-swathed crinolines, puffed sleeves, crocheted cobwebs, and squared-off knitwear shapes (these sometimes reminiscent of domestic loose covers or rugs) mark him out as a latter-day son of Vivienne Westwood. That\u2019s fine\u2014she\u2019s a Northerner, too\u2014and she gave Bovan a hearty personal benediction at his last show, praising his DIY craftiness, and hailing him as a new punk. The idea of witchcraft spoke to him, as it had to her, way back in the \u201980s\u2014in this case, after Bovan had been roaming Pendle Hill in Lancashire, the site of 17th-century village accusations, trials, and hangings of women, England\u2019s own equivalent of the hysteria of the Salem witch trials. His crinolined coven carried whittled sticks and odd talismanic pieces of jewelry. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a direct reference, I didn\u2019t want to do witches\u2019 cloaks and hats,\u201d he said. Yet he hadn\u2019t plucked the reference out of thin air. \u201cIt\u2019s been in my head, the scapegoating of people that goes on at the minute. The way some people have no way of pleading their case\u2014and that\u2019s it.\u201d What did he mean? Something to do with the present-day power of social media to mete out mob justice, or the violation of human rights going on apace in the modern world? Both, probably. The suggestion hovered there over the postshow conversation. Still, where some of his earlier collections have been out-and-out dystopian, separatist visions, this one showed distinct signs of maturity. Bovan actually graduated in knitwear, and this time he showed that clearly, in jacquard sweaters and skirts in patterns he described as \u201ccrests [and] spaceships. I like things that are like hieroglyphs, Roman numerals, words with hidden meanings. Like Keith Haring, really.\u201d One piece was emblazoned with a blowup of his own face, with another male face on top. \u201cOh, that\u2019s my right hand, Greg,\u201d he laughed. \u201cWe had to get a two-together rail card to go to the factory in Leicester, to make it cheaper. It was almost like bizarre mug shots, which was fun.\u201d That\u2019s it, about the charm of Matty Bovan, really. He makes fun out of living in dreary, divisive times, expresses the ambivalence of the British towards the state of their own country, and makes all sorts of people want to come together to join in his jolly homespun endeavor.

Even Moonlight director Barry Jenkins weighed in, calling its particular shade of red \u201cdeeply emphatic, yet serene.\u201d In our photo-saturated moment, the coat telegraphed its message loud and clear: \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me.\u201d Max Mara was the company behind it, and you can bet the brand capitalized on the situation. In the press, creative director Ian Griffiths said, \u201cYou develop an emotional relationship with a coat like nothing else in your wardrobe. I can imagine why Mrs. Pelosi chose to wear it for this important moment, and I\u2019m deeply honored.\u201d The label announced it would reissue the 2013 style in a range of colors for 2019. Mrs. Pelosi was front and center on Griffiths\u2019s Fall mood board this morning. He was making a connection between power and glamour. Traditionally a feminine trait, glamour hasn\u2019t always been linked with power, but with a record number of women in the House of Representatives, and multiple Democratic women presidential candidates gunning for the 2020 nomination, that\u2019s changing. Griffiths naturally wants to keep Max Mara in the conversation, and on the backs of Mrs. Pelosi and other women like her. Hence the collection\u2019s boss tailoring. Strong shoulders and full, pleated pants or skirts cut similarly were topped by matching coats, and the ensembles came in head-to-toe buff, camel, charcoal, or a tawny light brown. Extrapolating on the idea of working women, he added precisely cut utility pockets lifted from workwear to coats, vests, shift dresses, and a terrific poncho. The bags harnessed across the chest took the idea a step too far; they didn\u2019t pass the Roxane Gay rule: \u201cDressing like a woman means wearing anything a woman deems appropriate and necessary for getting the job done.\u201d There was no Pelosi red, but Griffiths did send out trios of models in bold colors.

The Fall collection was subtly infused with a discreet artsy inspiration, referencing Italian Transavanguardia artist Mimmo Paladino\u2019s sculptural works. His enigmatic golden masks were hinted at in the amber-hued silk lining of a masculine pin-striped coat in double cashmere with a matching pin-striped mink collar, and in the fan-pleated back of a double-cashmere riding coat, cut with refined neatness. In the same vein, a couture-inspired high-neck collar morphing into a hood graced a cocoon-shaped zippered short coat in featherweight mohair. An archetypal masculine wrap coat in double-felted cashmere impressed with its clean, essential lines. Each coat had a unique, expressive personality, designed with different women and body types in mind. Shapes were comfortable and forgiving, practical in a sumptuous, luxurious way. The outerwear was precise, but had supple, sensuous textures. Delicate, natural shades of gray, oatmeal, camel, and rust were balanced by a deep black that added allure and strength."}, {"Designer": "Melitta Baumeister", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Dressed in her own designs, Melitta Baumeister can\u2019t help but stand out. When we randomly crossed paths early last Sunday morning, both in pursuit of pastries, she was wearing the bubble-back, cropped biker jacket that opens her Fall collection, and she projected far more edge than most locals. Fast-forward to our showroom visit, and she followed up by saying that the jacket had proved a conversation starter when she was traveling from New York\u2014never mind its welcome padding during the flight. \u201cI hadn\u2019t tested it in a regular environment, and it prompted smiles and stares,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt becomes a moment of recognizing something out of the ordinary.\u201d Driving this point home, several images were propped with a mock subway pole, as though placing the model in the most routine setting of all. In real life, you wonder how fellow riders would perceive her \u201cbanana bra,\u201d with its highly suggestive phallic protrusions; if nothing more, it was a new assertion of personal space. Partly because she\u2019s reached her five-year anniversary, Baumeister has pivoted back toward the proportion experimentation that defined her early work\u2014and she\u2019s done so without neglecting the (relatively) wearable imperatives that started to emerge as her brand matured. Take a glance, for instance, at the glossy dress patterned like the wood grain inside a luxury car; to counter its rigid vinyl shape, she integrated a stretch panel down the back. The bulbous hips and squared shoulders of a dress in technical leather came from optional padding (imagine pillowy panniers). While it could just as easily be worn normally, the dress was sending a message of body transformation that, for Baumeister, is inextricably linked to empowerment. Each time she tried on another piece\u2014the top with foamy, ballooned sleeves; the spongy trench with a hidden belt; the shaggy faux goat hair capelet\u2014her petite frame became enclosed in a superhero statement of her own making. On a more human scale, quilted skirts with belts that boasted removable bucket bags, oversize cardigans, high-neck tops with trompe l\u2019oeil shirt collars, and coordinated pleated pieces were wardrobe novelties that stopped short of being weird. As of April, Baumeister will have corners at Dover Street Market in both Los Angeles and New York, and, given the store\u2019s emphasis on Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, she\u2019ll fit right in. In construction and signification, her approach seems comparatively simplified. Yet her instincts are interesting, and, one imagines, wearing her clothes from time to time would feel interesting, too."}, {"Designer": "Michael Kors Collection", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Pop culture is in the midst of a full-on \u201970s rewind.

Michael Kors isn\u2019t about to let this party pass him by. And why should he? He lived it. At a preview, he remembered tumbling out of Studio 54 way past dawn, grabbing breakfast at a diner, and heading straight to his job at boutique Lothar\u2019s, where he washed the nightclub\u2019s fake snow out of his hair in the bathroom sink. \u201cNew York was a pit, but we were dressed,\u201d he said. \u201cOptimism in the face of adversity, it\u2019s the only way you can win.\u201d He isn\u2019t the only designer who\u2019s following the good times for Fall; the feathers and fake fur have really been flying at the New York shows. Kors had both, in the form of colorful boas and an intarsia chevron coat. The collection was informed by his West 50s stomping grounds, with Studio 54 playing the lead role. Kors secured the rights to the logo, and he made plentiful use of it, embroidering it on a sequin T-shirt dress, splashing it across a full-length puffer, and printing silk blouses for both guys and girls, worn unbuttoned to the navel in both cases. Andrea True was on the soundtrack singing \u201cMore, More, More\u201d\u2014of course she was. Kors knows all the oldies, and he isn\u2019t one to shy away from camp. But there were also subtle cashmere knits in the mix\u2014minimalist nods to Lincoln Center\u2019s ballerinas that balanced the maximalism elsewhere. And he brought the lithe athleticism of those knits to dresses in sequined matte jersey. Dance-floor ready whatever the decade.

That joyful occasion, and folkloric inspirations, was the springboard for a characteristically upbeat and colorful collection that also conveyed, the designer allowed, a noticeably spiritual dimension. Her starting point: a blue-and-white-check robe coat with a hand-painted, embroidered, and patched scarf inspired by a native community in Lake Titicaca. There, husbands-to-be weave pledges to their brides into a \u201cpromise belt,\u201d which they then wear every day for the rest of their lives.

The new Fall collection made a showcase of that variety, from the chunky ikat-pattern coat that opened the show to the fine-gauge black and white vertical stripe tunic dress that closed it. To Missoni\u2019s point, there was quite a bit here that you wouldn\u2019t guess was knit\u2014the icy gray chevron jacquard pantsuit, for starters, and most of the chunky cardigan coats, which were boldly patterned. One of those coats was embellished with black and white guinea fowl feathers. Its graphic appeal was not insignificant, but the real attraction will be how it feels on the body: substantial and warm, obviously, but not heavy. Some of the finer-gauge, Lurex-shot pieces had the opposite effect; they were so weightless they were almost transparent\u2014a somewhat tricky proposition. Horizontally applied sequins on an ankle-grazing tank dress provided the kind of coverage most women want.

This time, the black-walled corridors and felted carpet insulation led the way to a catwalk lined with illuminated photographs, video screens, and stacks of vintage televisions showing work by the young New Zealand\u2013born, London-based artist Sharna Osborne. Disheveled teens in lingerie, blinking eyes, darkened windows, discarded Disney-theme toys, Dolly Parton, and roses, lots of roses: This is the bewitching mash-up of innocence and perversity, wonder, and loss, that speaks to fairy tales and allegories, and that has often defined the stubborn, soulful, and yet partial-to-sparkle Miu Miu girl. Come Fall, that girl (or woman, although, warning, this is a collection that skews young) will wear a cape, be it tweed or crocheted, of faux leather or hearty canvas. It\u2019s a diverse and plentiful assortment covering heritage, utility, artisanal, and evening; Miuccia Prada chose to highlight the cape because it is a garment that nods to both history and protection, and she sees in young people a desire to clothe themselves in something with meaning, given the perilous state of the world, and especially the environment. And so, to stand tall in a profoundly harsh climate, a young person of today needs that swagger, as well as a floral backpack (trend item!), a baby doll or mini skater dress (loveliest in cherry blossoms), a chain mail collar (why not?), and a boot or sandal with a massive and humorously unsightly mountain of tread and sole. (These are the ugliest ugly shoes ever, and that\u2019s a feat worthy of high praise in fashion land.) The stay-up tights are decorated with jewels and flowers, and there are glittery heels and velvet flats, all the touch points of the magpie Miu Miu wardrobe. The overall look is clever and romantic, and says something akin to this: I\u2019ve been through the woods. I\u2019ve gotten past the wolf. I like fairy tales, but I don\u2019t live in one. I know the forest from the trees."}, {"Designer": "MM6 Maison Margiela", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "As Maison Margiela leans deeper into its Galliano-isms, so does MM6 plunge into the archive of the house\u2019s founder, Martin Margiela. For Fall 2019, the brand decided to up its game, holding a small presentation at Milan Fashion Week alongside behemoths like Gucci and Jil Sander. In a tiny space of the Via della Spiga, MM6 completely covered a first-floor salon in white padding and mirrors, reflecting the white lab coats and white interiors of Martin Margiela\u2019s studio. Many of Margiela\u2019s signature ideas were back, too, like the shoe coverings and the ever-echoing vareuse, as well as new takes on comfortwear like a logo hoodie with an embroidered church on the front. A new favorite: the upside-down wine bottle bag, a truly perfect accessory for a woman on the go in these madcap times. But back to the clothing, which has evolved beyond Margiela essentialism into a clever interpretation of the maestro\u2019s core ideas. Coats were oversize, base layers were shrunken, and everything was blown up or out of proportion just ever so slightly. Puffer jackets, pleated skirts, cardigans, and straight trousers made in ultrasoft, dusty white materials looked like dreamscape versions of Margiela\u2019s greatest hits. Helping these white pouty ensembles come to life were the models in Milan, a cast of local women of a certain age having the time of their lives posing and dancing for Instagram snaps. Why these cool signoras are not in the lookbook is a puzzle. One of Martin Margiela\u2019s best strengths was knowing exactly how to cast a show to get his message across. If this collection is about the protection of soft garments, the escapism of clouds, and the classics of Martin Margiela, than these ladies are the ones to show and celebrate it in the lookbook. Most of them probably remember the Martin era, too."}, {"Designer": "Molly Goddard", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Molly Goddard may have risen to fashion stardom on the wings of her ethereal tulle dresses, but peel back the prettiness and you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s an earthy soul in her designs. \u201cDressed for the storm,\u201d was how the designer described the look of her new collection. To that end, models marched out with balaclavas wrapped around their heads and all-terrain knee-high boots on their feet. What\u2019s more, each one of her gorgeous party looks was layered over a pair of no-nonsense gray trousers. There were wind machines installed along the runway this afternoon to amplify the tumultuous metaphor. Charming full-skirted smocked dresses in neon green and pink silk were blown up in the air Marilyn Monroe\u2013style, though as Goddard insisted, the special effects were staged with Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy\u2019s ill-fated 19th-century British heroine, in mind, and not the 1950s blonde bombshell. After last season\u2019s jaunt to the Mediterranean, Goddard was feeling for the English countryside. The designer replaced the floral prints of Spring with her own take on traditional British motifs, including argyle sweaters with frayed patchwork finishings and vintage-inspired Lurex ribbon textiles. With eiderdown-like clutch bags and padded military-green ball gowns in the mix, the collection was underpinned by a sense of practicality and protection. Goddard elaborated on this mood backstage after the show, expressing her desire to create clothes that might offer stability in uncertain times. It was clearly no coincidence that the show was held in the beautiful atrium of Dunbar Court in Westminster, what is skipping distance from the houses of Parliament, where a real-life tempest is raging around the fate of the country in the European Union. Ultimately Goddard seemed to be challenging the notion that style-conscious women might have to chose between the levity of her tulle frocks and the strong shoulders of her pin-striped suiting. With her new collection she made it clear the two are hardly mutually exclusive\u2014indeed the tailoring was rendered with a more confident hand than ever. Overall the collection was one of the designer\u2019s strongest to date, and further proof that Goddard has what it takes to steer her brand in the right direction, come rain or shine."}, {"Designer": "Moncler 0 Richard Quinn", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Covering this year\u2019s round of the freshly expanded Moncler Genius project\u2014from which the new collections will drop every month for the next 12\u2014proved to be invigoratingly challenging. There were 11 different collections presented side by side in various formats in a series of railway arches under the lines north of Milan\u2019s central station. Most of the city had been invited to roll up at 8:00 p.m., but we nipped in 40 minutes early while the coast was relatively clear and tried to get the job done. That entailed sometimes interviewing designers without seeing the looks as they were still backstage, or sometimes seeing looks without interviewing designers. It was, as they say here, a casino\u2014but a fun one. Looking at the pictures that will go above this review, you\u2019ll probably have a better view of some of the collections than this reviewer. However, below is what was gleaned from the launch, in order of the collections\u2019 numeric categorization. 0 Moncler Richard Quinn\nThe sad truth is I never got to see this collection. But I did see its setting, a tunnel whose roof was clad in wild print with a runway flanked by black blooms. Happily, I also saw Quinn, lolling with two members of his team outside, and frantically pumped him for info. His response was: \u201cIt\u2019s about taking the shapes we usually do but putting them in a down-jacket context. Also using the fastenings that we used in the collection we showed in London yesterday. We have nice high puffer boots and puffer bags that are synonymous with Moncler. It\u2019s really a mash-up of the two worlds.\u201d 1 Moncler Pierpaolo Piccioli\nThis collection saw Valentino\u2019s often smoking and always interesting creative director apply a collaboration to a collaboration. He approached his friend Liya Kebede to input the patterns and aesthetic of her sustainable and socially responsible Ethiopian label Lemlem to his couture interpretation of Moncler. When we found PPP he was in his tunnel shooting his mise-en-sc\u00e8ne on his iPhone, surrounded by the usual phalanx of international PR reps. The looks had the same voluptuous volume of his first presentation for Genius, but here they were interrupted by the graphic vibrancy of Lemlem\u2019s contribution. So how has Moncler + PPP + Lemlem turned into his latest expression of Genius? He said: \u201cI don't think that you can really do anything new today. But you can create new harmonies\u2014new points of view and perspectives. Actually, I did this little collection while I was doing couture, while I was doing other things. And of course what I wanted to do is, through my own identity, interpret the worlds of Moncler. I felt I wanted to add the feeling of another perspective\u2014specifically the Liya perspective. I think that inclusivity is not a just word; I really believe in the idea of working together in a way that gives you new points of view . . . and I was thinking that when couture was born it was not meant to be for black women. It was just for white women. Magazines like Jet were not even allowed to borrow clothes! So this collection is to show that the dream of couture should be allowed for everybody, and that\u2019s why the idea of Liya worked so well.\u201d Kebede\u2019s virtuous circle of a label, Lemlem, is produced by artisan seamstresses in her native Ethiopia, who apply traditional patterns to contemporarily pitched European-style clothes. Piccioli said: \u201cI love the idea of celebrating craft and giving these women the opportunity to work. I wanted to re-create the Lemlem fabrics in nylon. I think that if you talk about something like this\u2014a new perspective\u2014it is very good.\u201d 2 Moncler 1952 (Donna)\nVeronica Leoni is one of the apparently endless supply of Phoebe Philo studio prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who have broken cover since the great Celine schism of 2018. I can\u2019t tell you she is the next Philo, but I can tell you she knows how to show a collection. Leoni\u2019s space was a large box filled with feathers in which her models stood looking out. The box was apparently made of reverse-reflection glass, so while the audience could see the models, they could not see us. About 30 seconds after we entered the room, it was plunged into darkness, interrupted only by strobes and Kate Bush (I think) at top volume on the PA system. So the clothes were essentially invisible but the designer was not, and she said: \u201cWe would consider this box a gathering of the greatest women we can find, in there to feel empowered by themselves but also exposed to us. We are kind of spying on them. And yeah, I think it is a fine line in between fashion and what needs to be after fashion. The dream of what you want to share.\u201d At this point I pleaded with Leoni\u2014we were standing in pitch blackness and her clothes were invisible. She laughed. \u201cYeah, but you are going to buy them! You will get the chance to see them!\u201d I had glimpsed some patches on a down jacket. \u201cThey were a collaboration with Itchy Scratchy Patchy\u2014made by Edie Campbell and Christabel MacGreevy. We tried to bring a little bit of that do-it-yourself vibe. And we decided to do a recognition of all of the female heroes in history, so there is Salome there is Sappho . . . there\u2019s a little bit of a \u201990s London clubbing atmosphere.\u201d In the strobe-punctuated darkness, it all made sense. 2 Moncler 1952 (Uomo)\nSergio Zambon\u2019s was, along with the Grenoble collection and Fragment, my favorite tunnel of the night in terms of being full of clothes I wanted to hustle the Moncler PR department into giving me. Zambon said: \u201cThis season it is about a very laid-back guy who loves nature but lives in a very big city. Specifically it is a guy from L.A., where the nature is very close. There is a slightly hippie mood in the collection. So there is a fringing on a down jacket and a down jacket in a cotton tie-dye.\u201d The looks were presented in surface-less survival domes and were pretty great. There was also a side note in Zambon\u2019s collaboration with Valextra, which was made up of oversize totes in super-luxe leather with piumino straps and customizable letter identification. 3 Moncler Grenoble\nThis was awesome. I like to ski, and I love Moncler\u2014whose roots are in ski and mountaineering\u2014to wear on the slopes. But today more than ever before, Sandro Mandrino elevated his skiwear to a conceptual level that sat above even the atmospheric by injecting the spirit of 1969 into this collection for 2019. \u201cThe idea was to translate the concept of old festivals in a modern way\u2014like a rave, but in the snow. We translate what is in our culture.\u201d Mandrino\u2019s tunnel was filled with lots of multi-colored tufted podiums and good music. Fringed summer-of-love-style touches were applied to hyper-technical GPS-enabled skiwear. The models in this tunnel were totally happy\u2014they\u2019d drawn the long straw. A great collection, and coolest room of the night. 4 Moncler Simone Rocha\nThe lovely and brilliant Simone Rocha was the first designer I bumped into this evening. She was gathering with the others for a group photograph but spared a moment to chat about a collection I had yet to see. She said: \u201cThis collection I was thinking more about nature. The set is outdoors\u2014they are in a forest of silver birch trees\u2014and I was thinking about Girl Guides protecting themselves against nature . . . the idea of camping and tents almost becomes their protection. And that is molded into voluminous puffer capes that are tied on . . . key pieces are definitely the tent capes which I have done in a blush with red. And I\u2019ve done some very special pearly headpieces, which I think are very Moncler.\u201d 5 Moncler Craig Green\nCraig Green ended up showing me pictures of his collection on a phone as the installation had yet to open\u2014and gave this commentary on what he showed. \u201cSo every season we draw on something that we think is at the core of Moncler\u2019s DNA. This collection was about lightness. All of the garments can pack into really small squares. As we were going through the design process, all of the choices we made\u2014in the zips, the poppers, everything\u2014were defined considering lightness as a prime factor. Including fabrics. I know everyone has done packable to death, but here we\u2019ve done it in a new way: There is a series of zips that pull the air out of the down as it is being closed. We've developed a new structure in making down panels. There is a 2.5-cm gap in between every single pillow, which acts as a hinge so you can fold it. And then the series of zips squeezes it and the whole folds into a flat square.\u201d Oh, Craig\u2014you chisel-chinned technical virtuoso\u2014you are almost OCD in your applied technicality. But the result is garments unlike those produced by any other designer. 6 Moncler 1017 Alyx 9SM\nMatthew Williams was still limping from his now legendary soccer injury when I met him in his installation. It consisted of models on a series of raised platforms as well as floor level. There were plenty of recognizable details from Williams\u2019s own line named after his daughter, Alyx. His key rollercoaster-belt fastening had been adapted into a chain belt worn above puffers and fastened by a carabiner. Those puffers were garment-dyed\u2014a key Alyx signature that had never been explored at Moncler before. He added: \u201cI just wanted it to be a real blend of some of the iconic parts of Alyx and of Moncler meshed together. And then we also have these seamless knits which are base layer garments\u2014tights and tops\u2014made from Econyl, recycled fishing line, which is really cool. Also a first, which is really nice. These vulcanized waterproof boots, made in a mold, are also new. We do a lot with leather at Alyx, so it was good to merge that into the bonded-leather jacket. And in some garments there is a material we developed for this project which is made of coated down feathers\u2014we took the most iconic thing for Moncler, the feather, which is something that is usually unseen\u2014and made it seen by coating it.\u201d At this point we went up some stairs at my demand to look further at said fabric\u2014which, to be frank, simply looked like a normal technical fabric, but which I totally believe was once made of feathers. At the top of the stairs I remembered Williams\u2019s leg is currently broken, and felt awful. 7 Moncler Fragment Hiroshi Fujiwara\nHiroshi Fujiwara obligingly emerged from his railway arch, in which a crowd of handsome young fellows was mingling on a floor of distorted check to a cacophonous soundtrack, to chat. The clothes in his third Genius collection looked heavily tinged by highly researched Americana\u2014technical Ivy League, and demob military surplus. This is what Fujiwara was kind enough to share: \u201cI am slowly getting used to how we can progress this mix between Moncler\u2019s and my kind of things. This time I think we\u2019ve made an even better combination. Moncler has great craftsmanship and technology for the winter clothes. So I\u2019m putting kind of my favorite things\u2014like vintage and military\u2014and combining them with this new technology.\u201d This idea of combining the emotional significance laden in the codes of vintage, as polished and nurtured by Fujiwara, with the technical metier of Moncler resulted in a collection that looked particularly strong. 8 Moncler Palm Angels | Art Breaking\nIn the event, Francesco Ragazzi\u2019s Palm Angels was the only Genius installation of the bunch we failed to inspect. There was just too much Genius to take in. Catching up with him a couple of days later, Ragazzi brought us up to speed: \u201cThe concept of the installation was that of a vandalized art gallery. It started with this image of a Jeff Koons show being vandalized by protestors, and then I collaborated with Willi Dorner, an artist out of Vienna who works in urban spaces, and we worked on this series of images. Then at the event, we had a lineup of outfits, and the idea was the audience could press this button and spray them with paint\u2014it was really fun.\u201d For the collection, Ragazzi said he took still more inspiration from Koons, incorporating his queasy metallic shades and playing fast and loose with conventional norms of volume. Over this were layered details that implied a subsequent and irreverent imprimatur: \u201cThere was graffiti, and the Moncler was distorted and twisted in volume and mashed up into collages. It was touched by punk and had this protest aspect\u2014mixing the purity of Moncler with something aggressive and darker.\u201d Moncler & Poldo Dog Couture\nThis was the big one, the one I\u2019d been especially keen to see: dog couture. A standalone article about it will follow, since many of the models were not on site, and this review is already as long on words as Moncler\u2019s Genius is full of ideas."}, {"Designer": "Moncler 1 Pierpaolo Piccioli", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Covering this year\u2019s round of the freshly expanded Moncler Genius project\u2014from which the new collections will drop every month for the next 12\u2014proved to be invigoratingly challenging.

Also using the fastenings that we used in the collection we showed in London yesterday. We have nice high puffer boots and puffer bags that are synonymous with Moncler. It\u2019s really a mash-up of the two worlds.\u201d 1 Moncler Pierpaolo Piccioli\nThis collection saw Valentino\u2019s often smoking and always interesting creative director apply a collaboration to a collaboration. He approached his friend Liya Kebede to input the patterns and aesthetic of her sustainable and socially responsible Ethiopian label Lemlem to his couture interpretation of Moncler. When we found PPP he was in his tunnel shooting his mise-en-sc\u00e8ne on his iPhone, surrounded by the usual phalanx of international PR reps. The looks had the same voluptuous volume of his first presentation for Genius, but here they were interrupted by the graphic vibrancy of Lemlem\u2019s contribution. So how has Moncler + PPP + Lemlem turned into his latest expression of Genius? He said: \u201cI don't think that you can really do anything new today. But you can create new harmonies\u2014new points of view and perspectives. Actually, I did this little collection while I was doing couture, while I was doing other things. And of course what I wanted to do is, through my own identity, interpret the worlds of Moncler. I felt I wanted to add the feeling of another perspective\u2014specifically the Liya perspective. I think that inclusivity is not a just word; I really believe in the idea of working together in a way that gives you new points of view . . . and I was thinking that when couture was born it was not meant to be for black women. It was just for white women. Magazines like Jet were not even allowed to borrow clothes! So this collection is to show that the dream of couture should be allowed for everybody, and that\u2019s why the idea of Liya worked so well.\u201d Kebede\u2019s virtuous circle of a label, Lemlem, is produced by artisan seamstresses in her native Ethiopia, who apply traditional patterns to contemporarily pitched European-style clothes. Piccioli said: \u201cI love the idea of celebrating craft and giving these women the opportunity to work. I wanted to re-create the Lemlem fabrics in nylon. I think that if you talk about something like this\u2014a new perspective\u2014it is very good.\u201d 2 Moncler 1952 (Donna)\nVeronica Leoni is one of the apparently endless supply of Phoebe Philo studio prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who have broken cover since the great Celine schism of 2018. I can\u2019t tell you she is the next Philo, but I can tell you she knows how to show a collection. Leoni\u2019s space was a large box filled with feathers in which her models stood looking out. The box was apparently made of reverse-reflection glass, so while the audience could see the models, they could not see us. About 30 seconds after we entered the room, it was plunged into darkness, interrupted only by strobes and Kate Bush (I think) at top volume on the PA system. So the clothes were essentially invisible but the designer was not, and she said: \u201cWe would consider this box a gathering of the greatest women we can find, in there to feel empowered by themselves but also exposed to us. We are kind of spying on them. And yeah, I think it is a fine line in between fashion and what needs to be after fashion. The dream of what you want to share.\u201d At this point I pleaded with Leoni\u2014we were standing in pitch blackness and her clothes were invisible. She laughed. \u201cYeah, but you are going to buy them! You will get the chance to see them!\u201d I had glimpsed some patches on a down jacket. \u201cThey were a collaboration with Itchy Scratchy Patchy\u2014made by Edie Campbell and Christabel MacGreevy. We tried to bring a little bit of that do-it-yourself vibe. And we decided to do a recognition of all of the female heroes in history, so there is Salome there is Sappho . . . there\u2019s a little bit of a \u201990s London clubbing atmosphere.\u201d In the strobe-punctuated darkness, it all made sense. 2 Moncler 1952 (Uomo)\nSergio Zambon\u2019s was, along with the Grenoble collection and Fragment, my favorite tunnel of the night in terms of being full of clothes I wanted to hustle the Moncler PR department into giving me. Zambon said: \u201cThis season it is about a very laid-back guy who loves nature but lives in a very big city. Specifically it is a guy from L.A., where the nature is very close. There is a slightly hippie mood in the collection. So there is a fringing on a down jacket and a down jacket in a cotton tie-dye.\u201d The looks were presented in surface-less survival domes and were pretty great. There was also a side note in Zambon\u2019s collaboration with Valextra, which was made up of oversize totes in super-luxe leather with piumino straps and customizable letter identification. 3 Moncler Grenoble\nThis was awesome. I like to ski, and I love Moncler\u2014whose roots are in ski and mountaineering\u2014to wear on the slopes. But today more than ever before, Sandro Mandrino elevated his skiwear to a conceptual level that sat above even the atmospheric by injecting the spirit of 1969 into this collection for 2019. \u201cThe idea was to translate the concept of old festivals in a modern way\u2014like a rave, but in the snow. We translate what is in our culture.\u201d Mandrino\u2019s tunnel was filled with lots of multi-colored tufted podiums and good music. Fringed summer-of-love-style touches were applied to hyper-technical GPS-enabled skiwear. The models in this tunnel were totally happy\u2014they\u2019d drawn the long straw. A great collection, and coolest room of the night. 4 Moncler Simone Rocha\nThe lovely and brilliant Simone Rocha was the first designer I bumped into this evening. She was gathering with the others for a group photograph but spared a moment to chat about a collection I had yet to see. She said: \u201cThis collection I was thinking more about nature. The set is outdoors\u2014they are in a forest of silver birch trees\u2014and I was thinking about Girl Guides protecting themselves against nature . . . the idea of camping and tents almost becomes their protection. And that is molded into voluminous puffer capes that are tied on . . . key pieces are definitely the tent capes which I have done in a blush with red. And I\u2019ve done some very special pearly headpieces, which I think are very Moncler.\u201d 5 Moncler Craig Green\nCraig Green ended up showing me pictures of his collection on a phone as the installation had yet to open\u2014and gave this commentary on what he showed. \u201cSo every season we draw on something that we think is at the core of Moncler\u2019s DNA. This collection was about lightness. All of the garments can pack into really small squares. As we were going through the design process, all of the choices we made\u2014in the zips, the poppers, everything\u2014were defined considering lightness as a prime factor. Including fabrics. I know everyone has done packable to death, but here we\u2019ve done it in a new way: There is a series of zips that pull the air out of the down as it is being closed. We've developed a new structure in making down panels. There is a 2.5-cm gap in between every single pillow, which acts as a hinge so you can fold it. And then the series of zips squeezes it and the whole folds into a flat square.\u201d Oh, Craig\u2014you chisel-chinned technical virtuoso\u2014you are almost OCD in your applied technicality. But the result is garments unlike those produced by any other designer. 6 Moncler 1017 Alyx 9SM\nMatthew Williams was still limping from his now legendary soccer injury when I met him in his installation. It consisted of models on a series of raised platforms as well as floor level. There were plenty of recognizable details from Williams\u2019s own line named after his daughter, Alyx. His key rollercoaster-belt fastening had been adapted into a chain belt worn above puffers and fastened by a carabiner. Those puffers were garment-dyed\u2014a key Alyx signature that had never been explored at Moncler before. He added: \u201cI just wanted it to be a real blend of some of the iconic parts of Alyx and of Moncler meshed together. And then we also have these seamless knits which are base layer garments\u2014tights and tops\u2014made from Econyl, recycled fishing line, which is really cool. Also a first, which is really nice. These vulcanized waterproof boots, made in a mold, are also new. We do a lot with leather at Alyx, so it was good to merge that into the bonded-leather jacket. And in some garments there is a material we developed for this project which is made of coated down feathers\u2014we took the most iconic thing for Moncler, the feather, which is something that is usually unseen\u2014and made it seen by coating it.\u201d At this point we went up some stairs at my demand to look further at said fabric\u2014which, to be frank, simply looked like a normal technical fabric, but which I totally believe was once made of feathers. At the top of the stairs I remembered Williams\u2019s leg is currently broken, and felt awful. 7 Moncler Fragment Hiroshi Fujiwara\nHiroshi Fujiwara obligingly emerged from his railway arch, in which a crowd of handsome young fellows was mingling on a floor of distorted check to a cacophonous soundtrack, to chat. The clothes in his third Genius collection looked heavily tinged by highly researched Americana\u2014technical Ivy League, and demob military surplus. This is what Fujiwara was kind enough to share: \u201cI am slowly getting used to how we can progress this mix between Moncler\u2019s and my kind of things. This time I think we\u2019ve made an even better combination. Moncler has great craftsmanship and technology for the winter clothes. So I\u2019m putting kind of my favorite things\u2014like vintage and military\u2014and combining them with this new technology.\u201d This idea of combining the emotional significance laden in the codes of vintage, as polished and nurtured by Fujiwara, with the technical metier of Moncler resulted in a collection that looked particularly strong. 8 Moncler Palm Angels | Art Breaking\nIn the event, Francesco Ragazzi\u2019s Palm Angels was the only Genius installation of the bunch we failed to inspect. There was just too much Genius to take in. Catching up with him a couple of days later, Ragazzi brought us up to speed: \u201cThe concept of the installation was that of a vandalized art gallery. It started with this image of a Jeff Koons show being vandalized by protestors, and then I collaborated with Willi Dorner, an artist out of Vienna who works in urban spaces, and we worked on this series of images. Then at the event, we had a lineup of outfits, and the idea was the audience could press this button and spray them with paint\u2014it was really fun.\u201d For the collection, Ragazzi said he took still more inspiration from Koons, incorporating his queasy metallic shades and playing fast and loose with conventional norms of volume. Over this were layered details that implied a subsequent and irreverent imprimatur: \u201cThere was graffiti, and the Moncler was distorted and twisted in volume and mashed up into collages. It was touched by punk and had this protest aspect\u2014mixing the purity of Moncler with something aggressive and darker.\u201d Moncler & Poldo Dog Couture\nThis was the big one, the one I\u2019d been especially keen to see: dog couture. A standalone article about it will follow, since many of the models were not on site, and this review is already as long on words as Moncler\u2019s Genius is full of ideas."}, {"Designer": "Moncler 2 1952", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Covering this year\u2019s round of the freshly expanded Moncler Genius project\u2014from which the new collections will drop every month for the next 12\u2014proved to be invigoratingly challenging. There were 11 different collections presented side by side in various formats in a series of railway arches under the lines north of Milan\u2019s central station. Most of the city had been invited to roll up at 8:00 p.m., but we nipped in 40 minutes early while the coast was relatively clear and tried to get the job done. That entailed sometimes interviewing designers without seeing the looks as they were still backstage, or sometimes seeing looks without interviewing designers. It was, as they say here, a casino\u2014but a fun one. Looking at the pictures that will go above this review, you\u2019ll probably have a better view of some of the collections than this reviewer. However, below is what was gleaned from the launch, in order of the collections\u2019 numeric categorization. 0 Moncler Richard Quinn\nThe sad truth is I never got to see this collection. But I did see its setting, a tunnel whose roof was clad in wild print with a runway flanked by black blooms. Happily, I also saw Quinn, lolling with two members of his team outside, and frantically pumped him for info.

There was also a side note in Zambon\u2019s collaboration with Valextra, which was made up of oversize totes in super-luxe leather with piumino straps and customizable letter identification. 3 Moncler Grenoble\nThis was awesome. I like to ski, and I love Moncler\u2014whose roots are in ski and mountaineering\u2014to wear on the slopes. But today more than ever before, Sandro Mandrino elevated his skiwear to a conceptual level that sat above even the atmospheric by injecting the spirit of 1969 into this collection for 2019. \u201cThe idea was to translate the concept of old festivals in a modern way\u2014like a rave, but in the snow. We translate what is in our culture.\u201d Mandrino\u2019s tunnel was filled with lots of multi-colored tufted podiums and good music. Fringed summer-of-love-style touches were applied to hyper-technical GPS-enabled skiwear. The models in this tunnel were totally happy\u2014they\u2019d drawn the long straw. A great collection, and coolest room of the night. 4 Moncler Simone Rocha\nThe lovely and brilliant Simone Rocha was the first designer I bumped into this evening. She was gathering with the others for a group photograph but spared a moment to chat about a collection I had yet to see. She said: \u201cThis collection I was thinking more about nature. The set is outdoors\u2014they are in a forest of silver birch trees\u2014and I was thinking about Girl Guides protecting themselves against nature . . . the idea of camping and tents almost becomes their protection. And that is molded into voluminous puffer capes that are tied on . . . key pieces are definitely the tent capes which I have done in a blush with red. And I\u2019ve done some very special pearly headpieces, which I think are very Moncler.\u201d 5 Moncler Craig Green\nCraig Green ended up showing me pictures of his collection on a phone as the installation had yet to open\u2014and gave this commentary on what he showed. \u201cSo every season we draw on something that we think is at the core of Moncler\u2019s DNA. This collection was about lightness. All of the garments can pack into really small squares. As we were going through the design process, all of the choices we made\u2014in the zips, the poppers, everything\u2014were defined considering lightness as a prime factor. Including fabrics. I know everyone has done packable to death, but here we\u2019ve done it in a new way: There is a series of zips that pull the air out of the down as it is being closed. We've developed a new structure in making down panels. There is a 2.5-cm gap in between every single pillow, which acts as a hinge so you can fold it. And then the series of zips squeezes it and the whole folds into a flat square.\u201d Oh, Craig\u2014you chisel-chinned technical virtuoso\u2014you are almost OCD in your applied technicality. But the result is garments unlike those produced by any other designer. 6 Moncler 1017 Alyx 9SM\nMatthew Williams was still limping from his now legendary soccer injury when I met him in his installation. It consisted of models on a series of raised platforms as well as floor level. There were plenty of recognizable details from Williams\u2019s own line named after his daughter, Alyx. His key rollercoaster-belt fastening had been adapted into a chain belt worn above puffers and fastened by a carabiner. Those puffers were garment-dyed\u2014a key Alyx signature that had never been explored at Moncler before. He added: \u201cI just wanted it to be a real blend of some of the iconic parts of Alyx and of Moncler meshed together. And then we also have these seamless knits which are base layer garments\u2014tights and tops\u2014made from Econyl, recycled fishing line, which is really cool. Also a first, which is really nice. These vulcanized waterproof boots, made in a mold, are also new. We do a lot with leather at Alyx, so it was good to merge that into the bonded-leather jacket. And in some garments there is a material we developed for this project which is made of coated down feathers\u2014we took the most iconic thing for Moncler, the feather, which is something that is usually unseen\u2014and made it seen by coating it.\u201d At this point we went up some stairs at my demand to look further at said fabric\u2014which, to be frank, simply looked like a normal technical fabric, but which I totally believe was once made of feathers. At the top of the stairs I remembered Williams\u2019s leg is currently broken, and felt awful. 7 Moncler Fragment Hiroshi Fujiwara\nHiroshi Fujiwara obligingly emerged from his railway arch, in which a crowd of handsome young fellows was mingling on a floor of distorted check to a cacophonous soundtrack, to chat. The clothes in his third Genius collection looked heavily tinged by highly researched Americana\u2014technical Ivy League, and demob military surplus. This is what Fujiwara was kind enough to share: \u201cI am slowly getting used to how we can progress this mix between Moncler\u2019s and my kind of things. This time I think we\u2019ve made an even better combination. Moncler has great craftsmanship and technology for the winter clothes. So I\u2019m putting kind of my favorite things\u2014like vintage and military\u2014and combining them with this new technology.\u201d This idea of combining the emotional significance laden in the codes of vintage, as polished and nurtured by Fujiwara, with the technical metier of Moncler resulted in a collection that looked particularly strong. 8 Moncler Palm Angels | Art Breaking\nIn the event, Francesco Ragazzi\u2019s Palm Angels was the only Genius installation of the bunch we failed to inspect. There was just too much Genius to take in. Catching up with him a couple of days later, Ragazzi brought us up to speed: \u201cThe concept of the installation was that of a vandalized art gallery. It started with this image of a Jeff Koons show being vandalized by protestors, and then I collaborated with Willi Dorner, an artist out of Vienna who works in urban spaces, and we worked on this series of images. Then at the event, we had a lineup of outfits, and the idea was the audience could press this button and spray them with paint\u2014it was really fun.\u201d For the collection, Ragazzi said he took still more inspiration from Koons, incorporating his queasy metallic shades and playing fast and loose with conventional norms of volume. Over this were layered details that implied a subsequent and irreverent imprimatur: \u201cThere was graffiti, and the Moncler was distorted and twisted in volume and mashed up into collages. It was touched by punk and had this protest aspect\u2014mixing the purity of Moncler with something aggressive and darker.\u201d Moncler & Poldo Dog Couture\nThis was the big one, the one I\u2019d been especially keen to see: dog couture. A standalone article about it will follow, since many of the models were not on site, and this review is already as long on words as Moncler\u2019s Genius is full of ideas."}, {"Designer": "Moncler 4 Simone Rocha", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Covering this year\u2019s round of the freshly expanded Moncler Genius project\u2014from which the new collections will drop every month for the next 12\u2014proved to be invigoratingly challenging. There were 11 different collections presented side by side in various formats in a series of railway arches under the lines north of Milan\u2019s central station. Most of the city had been invited to roll up at 8:00 p.m., but we nipped in 40 minutes early while the coast was relatively clear and tried to get the job done. That entailed sometimes interviewing designers without seeing the looks as they were still backstage, or sometimes seeing looks without interviewing designers. It was, as they say here, a casino\u2014but a fun one. Looking at the pictures that will go above this review, you\u2019ll probably have a better view of some of the collections than this reviewer. However, below is what was gleaned from the launch, in order of the collections\u2019 numeric categorization. 0 Moncler Richard Quinn\nThe sad truth is I never got to see this collection. But I did see its setting, a tunnel whose roof was clad in wild print with a runway flanked by black blooms. Happily, I also saw Quinn, lolling with two members of his team outside, and frantically pumped him for info. His response was: \u201cIt\u2019s about taking the shapes we usually do but putting them in a down-jacket context. Also using the fastenings that we used in the collection we showed in London yesterday. We have nice high puffer boots and puffer bags that are synonymous with Moncler. It\u2019s really a mash-up of the two worlds.\u201d 1 Moncler Pierpaolo Piccioli\nThis collection saw Valentino\u2019s often smoking and always interesting creative director apply a collaboration to a collaboration. He approached his friend Liya Kebede to input the patterns and aesthetic of her sustainable and socially responsible Ethiopian label Lemlem to his couture interpretation of Moncler. When we found PPP he was in his tunnel shooting his mise-en-sc\u00e8ne on his iPhone, surrounded by the usual phalanx of international PR reps. The looks had the same voluptuous volume of his first presentation for Genius, but here they were interrupted by the graphic vibrancy of Lemlem\u2019s contribution. So how has Moncler + PPP + Lemlem turned into his latest expression of Genius? He said: \u201cI don't think that you can really do anything new today. But you can create new harmonies\u2014new points of view and perspectives. Actually, I did this little collection while I was doing couture, while I was doing other things. And of course what I wanted to do is, through my own identity, interpret the worlds of Moncler. I felt I wanted to add the feeling of another perspective\u2014specifically the Liya perspective. I think that inclusivity is not a just word; I really believe in the idea of working together in a way that gives you new points of view . . . and I was thinking that when couture was born it was not meant to be for black women. It was just for white women. Magazines like Jet were not even allowed to borrow clothes! So this collection is to show that the dream of couture should be allowed for everybody, and that\u2019s why the idea of Liya worked so well.\u201d Kebede\u2019s virtuous circle of a label, Lemlem, is produced by artisan seamstresses in her native Ethiopia, who apply traditional patterns to contemporarily pitched European-style clothes. Piccioli said: \u201cI love the idea of celebrating craft and giving these women the opportunity to work. I wanted to re-create the Lemlem fabrics in nylon. I think that if you talk about something like this\u2014a new perspective\u2014it is very good.\u201d 2 Moncler 1952 (Donna)\nVeronica Leoni is one of the apparently endless supply of Phoebe Philo studio prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who have broken cover since the great Celine schism of 2018. I can\u2019t tell you she is the next Philo, but I can tell you she knows how to show a collection. Leoni\u2019s space was a large box filled with feathers in which her models stood looking out. The box was apparently made of reverse-reflection glass, so while the audience could see the models, they could not see us. About 30 seconds after we entered the room, it was plunged into darkness, interrupted only by strobes and Kate Bush (I think) at top volume on the PA system. So the clothes were essentially invisible but the designer was not, and she said: \u201cWe would consider this box a gathering of the greatest women we can find, in there to feel empowered by themselves but also exposed to us. We are kind of spying on them. And yeah, I think it is a fine line in between fashion and what needs to be after fashion. The dream of what you want to share.\u201d At this point I pleaded with Leoni\u2014we were standing in pitch blackness and her clothes were invisible. She laughed. \u201cYeah, but you are going to buy them! You will get the chance to see them!\u201d I had glimpsed some patches on a down jacket. \u201cThey were a collaboration with Itchy Scratchy Patchy\u2014made by Edie Campbell and Christabel MacGreevy. We tried to bring a little bit of that do-it-yourself vibe. And we decided to do a recognition of all of the female heroes in history, so there is Salome there is Sappho . . . there\u2019s a little bit of a \u201990s London clubbing atmosphere.\u201d In the strobe-punctuated darkness, it all made sense. 2 Moncler 1952 (Uomo)\nSergio Zambon\u2019s was, along with the Grenoble collection and Fragment, my favorite tunnel of the night in terms of being full of clothes I wanted to hustle the Moncler PR department into giving me. Zambon said: \u201cThis season it is about a very laid-back guy who loves nature but lives in a very big city. Specifically it is a guy from L.A., where the nature is very close. There is a slightly hippie mood in the collection. So there is a fringing on a down jacket and a down jacket in a cotton tie-dye.\u201d The looks were presented in surface-less survival domes and were pretty great. There was also a side note in Zambon\u2019s collaboration with Valextra, which was made up of oversize totes in super-luxe leather with piumino straps and customizable letter identification. 3 Moncler Grenoble\nThis was awesome.

Fringed summer-of-love-style touches were applied to hyper-technical GPS-enabled skiwear. The models in this tunnel were totally happy\u2014they\u2019d drawn the long straw.

This is what Fujiwara was kind enough to share: \u201cI am slowly getting used to how we can progress this mix between Moncler\u2019s and my kind of things. This time I think we\u2019ve made an even better combination. Moncler has great craftsmanship and technology for the winter clothes. So I\u2019m putting kind of my favorite things\u2014like vintage and military\u2014and combining them with this new technology.\u201d This idea of combining the emotional significance laden in the codes of vintage, as polished and nurtured by Fujiwara, with the technical metier of Moncler resulted in a collection that looked particularly strong. 8 Moncler Palm Angels | Art Breaking\nIn the event, Francesco Ragazzi\u2019s Palm Angels was the only Genius installation of the bunch we failed to inspect. There was just too much Genius to take in. Catching up with him a couple of days later, Ragazzi brought us up to speed: \u201cThe concept of the installation was that of a vandalized art gallery. It started with this image of a Jeff Koons show being vandalized by protestors, and then I collaborated with Willi Dorner, an artist out of Vienna who works in urban spaces, and we worked on this series of images. Then at the event, we had a lineup of outfits, and the idea was the audience could press this button and spray them with paint\u2014it was really fun.\u201d For the collection, Ragazzi said he took still more inspiration from Koons, incorporating his queasy metallic shades and playing fast and loose with conventional norms of volume. Over this were layered details that implied a subsequent and irreverent imprimatur: \u201cThere was graffiti, and the Moncler was distorted and twisted in volume and mashed up into collages. It was touched by punk and had this protest aspect\u2014mixing the purity of Moncler with something aggressive and darker.\u201d Moncler & Poldo Dog Couture\nThis was the big one, the one I\u2019d been especially keen to see: dog couture.

Notably, Lhuillier introduced faux fur for the first time: Each plush design had near identical faux and real versions. Lhuillier considers it a transitional period, as she hopes to one day switch over entirely, joining brands like Chanel, Burberry, and Gucci. \u201cWe\u2019re all more conscious about the environment, and that\u2019s the right thing moving forward,\u201d she said.

Their Fall collection had several good-looking new suits, but the big surprise was their outdoorsy bent. A classic-looking brown tweed jacket came with a built-in nylon hoodie and patchworked trousers; another more sculptural blazer was layered over a funnel-neck zip-up, like something you\u2019d get at R.E.I. Considering their busy day jobs\u2014designing four Monse collections per year on top of ready-to-wear, bridal, and kid\u2019s lines at Oscar de la Renta\u2014it\u2019s safe to assume Garcia and Kim aren\u2019t going off the grid for a hiking trip anytime soon. Who has the time? We\u2019re all eager to get outside and reconnect with nature, but most of us haven\u2019t had a chance to actually squeeze R&R into our schedule.

Of course, cargo pants, functional parkas, and hardy buckles and straps have been trending on the men\u2019s and women\u2019s runways for a few seasons now. The fact that they appeal to both genders may be the key to the trend\u2019s longevity: Garcia said he knew they\u2019d hit their stride when the buffalo-check hoodies and leather-trimmed anoraks looked equally cool on their male and female fit models. Those anoraks were among the more novel, investment-worthy items; ditto the oversize shearling with a diamond jacquard pattern that mimicked a classic Patagonia fleece. Garcia\u2019s favorite piece made a subtler statement: a short-sleeved performance jersey top with a drawstring cinching the waist, an asymmetrical hem, and a slit at the neck. It was inspired by a cycling shirt one of his colleagues wore to the office and will make a clever alternative to a T-shirt or button-down. Garcia and Kim didn\u2019t style it with bike shorts (phew!) but with flared jersey trousers with sporty decals on the sides.

Choi continued to demonstrate this preternatural skill with her third presentation. Her first two were exquisitely curated, evoking a cerebral elegance with references to curios and the charting of stars. Though beautiful, this sort of jewel-box staging can become overly precious. Clever Choi exchanged it for something more modern: an empty soundstage, in which she erected a clear plastic structure framed with wood for a \u201ccircular viewing.\u201d Light shone from behind through the panes, which were ribbed and frosted like fogged-up mirrors. At intervals through the hour, models walked around the structure and stood in place for guests to admire the well-made clothes.

On a practical note, she made two smart additions: jersey and knit items, which were a more commercial complement to her silk and wool pieces.

They lent a little more polish to their signature graphic T-shirts, tie-dyed sweatshirts, and bomber jackets.

He said so backstage: \u201cIt\u2019s different this season, and that was my goal.

Cadwallader evoked Mugler\u2019s signature hourglass shapes by combining flat panels with draped bits\u2014structure and flou\u2014in one piece. He did this on fitted long-sleeved sheaths, as well as on flouncy minidresses shown with boots that nearly grazed the dresses\u2019 hems. Like the tailored jackets, the dresses are engineered to flatter and enhance curves; that Cadwallader manages this while maintaining the comfort quotient is a nice trick. Elsewhere, there was pattern play in a pair of looks patchworked together from leather scraps found in a storage closet at Mugler HQ.

The other motifs in the collection\u2014checks, plaids\u2014pulled from a more instantly recognizable lexicon of British heritage fabrics. Like many designers in London this season, Coca had been exploring the line between anarchy and tradition.

Then Karl came up to my stand and bought a white shirt right there and then. He was the most legendary designer ever, and he encouraged me. I saw him in the distance, at a LVMH reception, much later on. He was surrounded by all these people, but he waved me over, and in front of all these important people, he put his hand on my shoulder and said, \u2018I\u2019ve never forgotten that white shirt, Nabil.\u2019 \u201d White shirts are what Nabil Nayal does, essentially, but these are exalted, historically researched white shirts, which is what Lagerfeld must have applauded. It was easy to imagine his approval of the shape Nayal\u2019s collection has taken this season: that of a major, panniered centerpiece dedicated to Marie Antoinette. She was spirited up in diaphanously snowy white organdy fashioned in the style of an 18th-century chemise \u00e0 la reine, complete with steel hip panniers and a ruffle-edged train. Processing in an ostrich-feather pompadour, the model was led out to take her seat in the center of the presentation by a flurry of attendants carrying her train, including the two costume experts with whom Nayal had collaborated. \u201cI worked with the School of Historical Dress, a small beautiful school in [the London Borough of] Lambeth,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been inspired by looking at their archives and also by studying the form of an incredible yellow 18th-century dress which is in the Met in New York. Marie Antoinette popularized this style in the 1760s and 1770s. It could be worn with or without the hoops. Like this one!\u201d He\u2019d titled the collection Let Them Revolt, a resonance that might reverberate among any French fashion onlookers right now. \u201cMarie Antoinette was the beginning of haute couture in France; she drove innovation because she wanted to commission the best of everything,\u201d Nayal explained. \u201cShe kept mills alive and craftspeople going, but at the same time, it cost a lot of money, and people started rebelling against that. But she couldn\u2019t do right for doing wrong because when she did dress more simply, the craftspeople started protesting because it damaged their businesses.\u201d Nayal\u2019s craft is made by his own hands, and he has a precise touch with crisp white-on-white cotton piqu\u00e9 and poplin, ruffled cuffs, and poet sleeves. Marie Antoinette had her courtiers standing in the background, wearing Nayal\u2019s more commercial offerings: a chemise with a foulard, a frock-coat dress with an integrated waistcoat. Even the Queen was, in fact, wearing black pants and a man\u2019s white shirt with her gown. \u201cIt has to have a modern context.

They were once a part of what was referred to as the Halstonettes\u2014Roy Halston\u2019s muses in the 1970s. Khan apprenticed for Halston back in the day, and it was during his time in that studio working alongside the legendary designer that he learned his craft. The collection he showed today, like many of his collections, made nods to his former mentor through the draping and the figure-hugging dress silhouettes. Backstage, Khan articulated that the politically and socially charged times we\u2019re living in now mirror those of Halston\u2019s \u201970s. It seemed like he was trying to balance then and now, both in his heart and in his mind. He didn\u2019t elaborate on the state of the world too much, but seeing him walk the runway with Cleveland, Chinn, and Bjornson it was plain to see that he misses those good old days, though of course he\u2019s still moving forward and evolving his brand. As far as the Halstonettes were concerned, time is standing still. They all looked flawless in their spectacular stretch sequin gowns. The rest of Khan\u2019s offering this season catered to a younger crowd, one that spends money on luxury but likes to pair it with a pair of jeans from H&M or Zara. The designer was quick to point out that 80 percent of the collection this season was separates, including embroidered vests, trousers, and sequin print blouses. His black, gold, and silver deco beaded jacket would look fantastic with a plain t-shirt, as would a cool velvet blazer. Khan also infused some of his heritage in the collection, mainly via the floral embroideries and vibrant color palette that called to mind the landscapes of India where he was born. His signature eveningwear didn\u2019t disappoint either, especially when it came to the very Halston-esque jersey cross halter gown and a pink feathered mini dress with crystal embellished straps.

Some of the quirk felt forced and futile: A wraparound trench that sat twisted high on the right shoulder and low on the left looked like its wearer had rushed out of the house without noticing her button-to-buttonhole arrangement was entirely wrong. While it was interesting to learn that the hand-sketched prints were by award-winning graphic designer Ondrej Rudavsky, without that context, they looked like garments scrawled with doodles that signified little in themselves. The most winning pieces here were the most subtle: a white rib-knit sweater and dress with a pretty, overlapping effect on the chest, and a version in beige whose softness pleasingly wrestled with the hardness of the pocketed and back-buttoned cotton drill skirt below. A pair of black leather pants worn under a nipped-waist tailored jacket was gorgeously cut.

And it\u2019s more than obvious in the suits she makes in Italy, many from materials she has specially created for her burgeoning brand. Li\u2019s innovation for Fall is in her knit suiting. Typically, of course, tailoring is constructed from wovens. The knits\u2014both a lofty midnight charcoal herringbone and a sportier pinstripe rib\u2014give her suits an appealingly easy mien. Not casual, Li would like to be clear; she doesn\u2019t want her customer to look like they\u2019re in sweats. But definitely easeful. At a showroom appointment, the model wore the suits with Converse high-tops, accentuating their relaxed attitude, but they\u2019d stand up to a Chelsea boot, or even a heel. Another example of Li\u2019s out-of-the-box thinking for Fall is her puffer. The name doesn\u2019t really fit, for while the coat is lined in a thin, quilted layer of goose down, the outer layer is water-repellent, super-fine merino, the glossy finish of which looks like leather from a distance. Without bulk, it promises to keep its wearer quite warm. Li\u2019s clothes do not speak loudly, and that\u2019s entirely by design.

This architectural undertaking was both a labor of love and a prime example of the brother-sister duo\u2019s work ethos. \u201cCreating a world reflective of the things you love,\u201d Christopher explained at a studio appointment. Of late, the shed had become Nicholas\u2019s art studio, and the watershed series of abstract paintings she created there made their way onto Fall\u2019s clothes. \u201cWe took those abstract forms and translated them from canvas to clothes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to create clothes that looked one way but were convertible or transitional to different forms.\u201d Convertibility, utility, and sustainability are the core pillars of Nicholas K; the last has only grown more important with each passing season, as their sustainable shed also suggests. There were pant-skirt hybrids and nifty knee-length sweaters that could literally be flipped upside down and worn as a shorter shawl knit. By far, the alpaca-wool pieces were the star of the show. The Kunzes source the sustainable, nontoxic fibers from Peruvian ranchers; they are completely free of dye.

Modern girls deal with a lot, and everything from environmental awareness to astrology found its way into Miller\u2019s Fall messaging. \u201cI started out with a sustainable approach, and [I was] trying to redo vintage things, but it just evolved from there,\u201d shared Miller backstage. \u201cThese are [concerns] in everybody\u2019s life that we\u2019re all dealing with.\u201d Upcycled cashmere sweaters served as a starting point. Tie-dyed and embellished with sequins, they offered a youthful twist on the wardrobe staple. Astrology symbols were embroidered onto silk blouses and dresses with built-in evil-eye talismans. Leather jackets and oversize blazers had a borrowed-from-the-boys quality, but the addition of slogan-covered patches tempered their toughness. There was a Generation X vibe that carried through the collection, from its use of grunge redux plaids to the combat boots and black beanies that provided the final touches on models\u2019 looks. The 1990s were great, but Miller kept things modern via fabrication. Plush faux fur on cuffs and the hems of skirts plus a finale series of sequin- and bead-embellished pieces that could easily transition from the concert venue to the red carpet were especially appealing. Add to this the introduction of denim made from recycled soda bottles and a forthcoming set of anti-plastic T-shirts, and Miller\u2019s vision for Fall felt utterly of the moment. \u201cThe impetus for the collection took me in a different direction, but, through that, I was able to find the balance,\u201d said Miller. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing my part; we\u2019re getting the message across.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Nili Lotan", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Nili Lotan isn\u2019t one for specific references, so it was a surprise to hear that Fall 2019 had a single jumping-off point: While she was visiting the Mus\u00e9e Yves Saint Laurent in Paris, she came upon a photo of a woman in polka dots and pinstripes, which became two of the main prints in the collection. There were notes of Saint Laurent elsewhere, too: in the tie-neck blouses, the expanded tailoring, the little button-front vests. If Diane Keaton doesn\u2019t know about Lotan, someone should tell her. Photos of the actress in her signature \u201970s suits and ties were on Lotan\u2019s moodboard. (There was a photo of Lauren Hutton, too; Lotan said she admired both women for ignoring trends and dressing with confidence.) Keaton\u2019s style is a bit different now, and she\u2019s been sharing it on Instagram in a series of outfit posts: mostly black suits and dresses, thick belts, platform boots, and wide-brim hats. It\u2019s a bit more goth than Lotan\u2019s vibe, but we have a feeling she\u2019d be really into the three-piece suits and high-rise leather trousers. Since Lotan reorganized her business last season\u2014she now has a core line called NL, reserved for the army pants, sweatshirts, and slip dresses women buy year-round\u2014she\u2019s been able to explore new garments, often within the realm of \u201ccasual luxe\u201d dressing. For Fall, she\u2019s expanding her leather offering with lizard-embossed blazers and pants; she designed a few handfuls of \u201cdinner blouses\u201d in hand-beaded silk or glossy jacquard; and she\u2019s experimenting with prints, like the zebra stripe on a velvet coat. Broken up, of course, each piece was pretty simple\u2014a blazer, a sweater, a shirt\u2014but it\u2019s the slouch in the proportion and the way Lotan styles it that makes it memorable. She had a few models on hand to try everything on this afternoon, and that louche, yet pulled-together attitude comes across even better in person. As much as this writer enjoys chatting with Lotan in her tranquil showroom, she should consider doing something \u201cofficial\u201d on the calendar next season.

The couple, in work and in life, have a young menswear label, Botter, whose oversize tailoring and energetic humor caught the attention of the fashion world last year. They were LVMH Prize finalists and picked up the top design award at the Festival d\u2019Hy\u00e8res. They\u2019ve never designed womenswear. Nina Ricci is a historic house with the most feminine of aesthetics. As a couturier, Ricci didn\u2019t have the distinctive design signature of contemporaries like Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga, Coco Chanel, or Madame Gr\u00e8s, but her perfume, L\u2019Air du Temps, is one of the most famous going. \u201cThey gave us a blank page,\u201d said Herrebrugh at a preview. Not unpredictably, their debut leaned heavily toward tailoring. With an eye to couture shapes, they planted a big bow at one shoulder of a double-breasted boxy jacket and swaddled others with demonstrative wraps. The designers proved they have a contrarian streak: The maillot shapes that they superimposed on the bodies of coats and blazers were, they said, a riff on the traditional corsets found in Nina Ricci tailleurs of old. The results weren\u2019t quite as elegant as they probably hoped, but one exercise that worked well was the patternmaking they did using a parasol. Opened and laid flat, it provided the template for the twisting shape of the show-opening blouse, which was as light and airy as what is expected at Nina Ricci. The hats, sort of like oversize cloches perched high on the head, were modeled on the cap at the tip of the parasol. The designers came at the trademark Ricci lightness a couple of other ways. One was to use lawn-chair mesh for several pieces, including a dress and skirt layered over trousers\u2014the oversize grommets and thick cording were the giveaways. Their other idea was to reproduce Bubble Wrap in organza; small and large squares of the bubbles decorated two-dimensional dresses. \u201cIt was quite a lot of research,\u201d Herrebrugh said. It makes sense, never having designed womenswear, that the duo would approach this project conceptually.

Sort of. None of these looks were designed to be worn on the street as they were on the runway. The handsome gabardine-and-gold trench coats with cut-outs across the shoulder that revealed the bra straps and shoulders of the wearer were zip-up-able. You could pull up that half-fallen-down red cashmere sweater simply by hoicking your shoulders into it and zipping it at the spine. To lessen the NSFW impact of an otherwise finely combined long open trench over a high closed one that revealed the big knickers worn below, the classy choice would be to wear some pants. And so forth. Whether worn as a suggestive midpoint somewhere between dressed and undressed or zipped up and done up, this was a collection bulging with merchandise worth heavy-breathing over. The ragged-pattern lace\u2014which mirrored the disarray of that boucl\u00e9\u2014and the richly embellished silks were precision-cut to punctuate the form within. Dell\u2019Acqua said he had been inspired by Brian De Palma\u2019s Dressed to Kill, a very stylish but very much male-gaze \u201cerotic thriller\u201d that reflects the mores of 1980. Some touches, like the large bows on the back of certain dresses\u2014which, in the context of the presentation, seemed to suggest the wearers were somehow gifts\u2014and the choice of the name given to the handbag that many models were dangling, the Lolita, seemed pretty dubious. Yet you could see that Dell\u2019Acqua\u2019s exploration of what he called \u201cthe sexiness situation\u201d came from a sincere and, to him, feminocentric place: These were clothes that allowed the wearer to compel, repel, or impel the male eye depending on the manner of their deployment.

She seemed happily overwhelmed, and that go-go-go attitude felt right at home with her Fall 2019 collection. Bereson has always made it her priority to design clothes that fit into a busy woman\u2019s life, and this season\u2019s offering was no different. A red, slightly baggy corduroy suit is perfect to throw on and go, whether to a meeting, to the office, to your kid\u2019s school\u2019s art fair, to whatever, really. Same goes for Bereson\u2019s mixed-print floral frock and her leopard-print blazer and matching A-line skirt. The nubby crochet sweaters and knit sweats are also versatile pieces. Bereson rarely speaks of a single muse or source of inspiration, instead focusing on how she\u2019d want to buy and wear and live in a certain garment, one with effortlessly cool style. No.6 is a brand that has little affiliation with trends. The clothes are made for the multitaskers like Bereson who don\u2019t want to expend their energy on styling themselves every morning.

To be able to approach this subject, perhaps the most harvested in womenswear, and emerge with a fresh perspective is a testament to the designer\u2019s particular vision and unique technique. As the first looks stalked forth from backstage, we were hit with a gust of rose scent\u2014this was not being pumped into the Salle Wagram, Ninomiya demurred afterward, but came entirely from the hundreds of roses insinuated into the models\u2019 rosy red wigs by Azuma Makoto. Those first outfits were a series of dramatically silhouetted black honeycombs achieved by Ninomiya\u2019s stitchless riveted technique that came layered over lighter, soft pink trellis-like shells. Dark tendrils spiked from the outer layer into lighter substance of inner like a fierce, unpruned invasive climber. Next we saw a multi-look mixed bouquet dedicated to Ninomiya\u2019s home turf: bikers, tuxedo-topped pleated aprons over black pants, and halter/harness attached shirts of spikily abstract triangular panel skirts around which were overgrown more wildly sculpted thickets of dense black bloom. A black apron\u2014the skirt did not encircle the entire circumference of the human\u2014was made from long, tapered, pillow-like panels, which seemed a slight aside from the rose theme but was alluringly new in itself. Two looks came with a pair of irregularly woven ovoid baskets of black stem-like links, one surrounding the arms of the wearer, the next enveloping the legs. A purple rose brocade sprouted from one petal-cloud skirt before a final flourish of hyper-volumized signature Ninomiya sculpted fabric pieces in soft pink and black that rustled as they passed. The funereal, the romantic, the spiked, the soft, the wild, and the cultivated were all perennial rose-associated characteristics arranged anew via Ninomiya\u2019s distinctive dialect of poetically conceived fabric stanzas."}, {"Designer": "Nomia", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "It\u2019s an understatement to say that the conversation around sustainable fashion\u2014or just \u201cconscious fashion,\u201d if you can\u2019t abide the former term\u2014has exploded in recent years. In 2030, will we regard these pre-2020 days as a major turning point? Or will we we be so far ahead that the changes and innovations we\u2019re seeing now will feel totally negligible? (That would be a good thing, for the record.) We can\u2019t predict the future, but we do have a feeling vegan leather is about to have a breakthrough, similar to the way faux fur suddenly became the norm a couple of years ago. Faux fur is everywhere, but the number of designers using faux leather is shockingly low: There\u2019s Stella McCartney, of course; Rooney Mara\u2019s new label, Hiraeth, which also mixes silk, wool, and cashmere; and Yara Flinn\u2019s 10-year-old Nomia (among others). Nomia has never really been linked to animal rights, nor has Flinn marketed the fact that her brand is leather-free, but let\u2019s just say her intuition was right-on when she decided to invest in high-quality vegan materials instead of the real stuff. Fall 2019\u2019s olive faux-leather motorcycle jacket was buttery-soft, and her signature Lucite-heeled boots are among the most fashion-forward vegan leather shoes we\u2019ve seen. They come in glossy satin, too, which also appeared on this season's newest accessories: a flat belt bag and a bucket bag with hand-knotted \u201cbungee cord\u201d details. Those sporty, outdoorsy touches are a Nomia signature; there was a drawstring to cinch the waist of a lightly padded coat, as well as on the opening of a cut-out blouse. Flinn\u2019s m.o. is to whip up those rugged pieces in unexpected colors and fabrics: The coat was a light ginger, for instance, and a pair of \u201ccarpenter pants\u201d with contrast stitching were done in a glossy black satin, not canvas.

Not only is the style of photography similar, but back are the fringe and the tracksuits the designer has been showing for decades; also returning are slim-fit suits and black-and-white prints. So more of the same? Yes and no. As a businesswoman, Kamali has to think globally and consider how she can appeal \u201cto everyone in the world who has access to me, and who I have access to\u201d while taking into consideration different climates, attitudes toward gender, religious behaviors, lifestyles, et cetera. It\u2019s a big remit, but Kamali is confident that it\u2019s possible to complete this puzzle without flattening or watering down her work. \u201cThe way you stay authentic,\u201d she says, \u201cis to evolve and grow and be relevant.\u201d Having a well-defined design vocabulary is a boon to her brand equity; still, it would be refreshing to see some new silhouettes from Kamali. The Fall collection does deliver newness and relevance in this collection. It\u2019s there in the transparent pieces, for example. When worn over a black leotard, as seen in Look 10, a see-through slip dress evokes a Helmut Newton power woman. Peek-a-boo track separates, meant for layering, in contrast, are unexpected and playful. Kamali is a pragmatic designer in some ways (her clothes can travel, be thrown in the wash), but she also possesses a special radar that\u2019s tuned into the now\u2014and the next. Currently she\u2019s deep into learning about VR and AI, and she\u2019s looking into ways they can be applied to fashion. Her great experience gives her perspective, too, allowing her to place current needs and trends within a larger matrix. Her use of khakis and olive drabs and her focus on gender neutrality are right for now, but they also relate to what came before, specifically the 1970s. \u201cWe keep talking about the 1970s,\u201d Kamali says, \u201cbut there\u2019s a reason: [It was the time of the] Vietnam War. There was meditation and peace and love, and then there were protests, fires, police . . . . That energy is back again.\u201d It\u2019s a contradictory force that has some running for shelter in the designer\u2019s famous sleeping bag coats, offered in camo for Fall. This motif, which is apparently a huge draw at retail, appeals to a \u201csubliminal sense of protection,\u201d says Kamali. The designer, who has dressed the New York Dolls, hasn\u2019t ignored exhibitionists though.

Warmflash is also known for her use of bold color, and there was plenty of it on display this season. She had been looking at Art Deco shapes and forms ahead of designing this collection too, which mainly resulted in a great print of a flapper girl\u2019s profile. That pattern was used on a pretty paneled skirt and on one of Warmflash\u2019s popular cocktail dresses. It was also blown up to epic proportions and embroidered to the side of a beautifully cut black evening gown. That dress won\u2019t be for everyone, but the craftsmanship and detailing put into it were worthy of praise. So were the bright floral trousers and dresses, and the red tea dress punctuated by its metallic fil coupe.

The checked pattern was \u201ccrash derby race car culture. One of the things I grew up with in suburban America that\u2019s been on the periphery of my vision. It\u2019s a play on the checkered flag\u2014the goal,\u201d he said.

But now it\u2019s commonplace. I\u2019m intrigued by the empowered woman who wants to dress in a feminine but chic way.\u201d In fact, if you scroll back through Off-White womenswear collections, it\u2019s noticeable that one of Abloh\u2019s signatures\u2014besides his labeling of everything in quotation marks\u2014is glamour and sexiness. While those qualities might not have been accepted by the mainstream before, they are very much front and center in everyone\u2019s minds this season, what with all the sweeping volumes and strong-shouldered tailoring that\u2019s surfacing everywhere. So there: When Abloh puts out giant A-line puffer coats and slick leather tailoring, it\u2019s as a now fully acknowledged member of the general trend conversation. A difference being that a quintessentially Off-White version of a classic tuxedo suit is the seasonal serving of his underpants look: a cropped silver satin midriff-baring jacket with matching micro-shorts, accessorized with crystal gloves and a clutch bag. There were a couple of day \u201csuits\u201d which did the same thing: long coats with matching shorts. What was less apparent was Abloh\u2019s use of fabric as an embodiment of change. He said he\u2019s been \u201cleaping forward with taking fleece and jersey and cutting it so it has a very feminine, couture-like shape.\u201d The draped, wrapped, asymmetrical dresses\u2014shapes inspired by twisted car-crash sculptures\u2014were cut from material \u201cthat\u2019s native to Off-White, like hoodie and T-shirt fabric,\u201d he said. The finale, of course, had its now traditional drama, with friends of the house Karlie Kloss, the Hadid sisters, and Adut Akech sweeping to the finish line in super-billowy, leg-baring gowns. It\u2019s the stuff of swathes of young girls\u2019 fantasies to be able to go somewhere looking like that; princess dreams of the 21st century brought to life. \u201cI have views on red carpet,\u201d said Abloh.

On the fashion front, tailoring is experiencing a renaissance, and Theyskens\u2019s extreme sculpted shoulders put him in the middle of that conversation. There was an almost replicant-like rigor to the suit jackets and narrow midi skirts, but Theyskens indicated that it was intentional. \u201cIt\u2019s about the power of a great entrance,\u201d he said.

The heart is literal in a sweet print that appears on puffers and tops, but is still felt in a range of shimmery, sequin skirts and silk dresses inspired by Hong Kong actresses Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung.

The idea is less about a specific place than it is about celebrating the riches beyond the next closed door. That\u2019s why they chose the Mosque-Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, as the reference point for their set. They liked its layers of history, both Islamic and Christian. Presumably, De la Renta did too. C\u00f3rdoba was a place he often visited, they shared. The show opened with sellable, polished tailoring. An extended riff on tweeds, menswear checks, and spice colors, it was true to the house heritage\u2014De la Renta always opened with suiting, too\u2014but streamlined for the current moment. The houndstooth sheath with a bias-cut inset of Prince of Wales check at the hem was winning. Daywear cycled into eveningwear via a series of carpet prints and carpet jacquards. The print dress was representative of the softer, lighter garments that are proving successful for Kim and Garcia among a younger clientele. Antique carpets were the dominant motif in the after-dark section. The designers worked the metaphor on a short cocktail number trailing fringe, on a strapless wrap with the ease of a sarong, and on a lovely sleeveless column in tufted fil coupe with a train that traced the flower borders. Texture and pattern played key roles in the other evening knockouts, which combined black tulle with jewel-tone laser-cut silk velvet. For the most part, Kim and Garcia moved away from the ball gowns of Oscar de la Renta collections past. Bella Hadid\u2019s finale number retained those grand proportions, only with the arabesque tessellations of Islamic decoration for a design.

The collection was small, just 20 looks, but perfectly delicious. A strapless, full-skirted black leather dress featured a tight ruffle at the neckline. A cutely cut double-breasted black suit included a huge ruffle of tulle at the collar. A long coat and bomber came in contrasting checks of shiny vinyl and matte fabric. And a beautiful skirt in what looked like a repurposed venetian blind in iridescent rainbow shades was cut into three angular tiers and worn south of a puff-cuffed black cotton shirt. When its wearer walked, the tattoo print on one full dress seemed to shiver on the garment. That sense of motion was thanks to the print\u2019s application to two layers of fabric.

At Ottolinger, designers Christa B\u00f6sch and Cosima Gadient have found inspiration in a wide variety of sci-fi fantasies over the years. For Fall 2019, their big talking point was The Three Body Problem, a Chinese super novel that has been made into a film. The plot of that book is too complicated to get into here, but know this\u2014like any good sci-fi work, the worlds in The Three Body Problem are not so unlike the actual world, no matter how many physical paradoxes or alien species exist. The human condition is human, after all. It\u2019s an apt idea for the Ottolinger designers, who, no matter how far they push their experimental tendencies, never fully break from making serious, smart clothing. Take their opening look, a knit-dress-and-cardigan set that could read as downright preppy if it were not paired with sculptural shoes by United Nude and a sort of gunked-up schoolgirl tote. Later on, B\u00f6sch and Gadient explored plaids, re- and deconstructing them as though they had been through a wormhole, but never straying too far from a modest bracelet sleeve and midi skirt silhouette. They also offered their own take on slick black tuxedo dressing as a suit or minidress and developed a lime-green foulard-inspired dress that was simply lovely, no strings attached. Because B\u00f6sch and Gadient drape every look on the body, their clothing has a sensual, undulating line to it. It was on display today in a series of jackets and super-slim trousers with curved zippers and cargo pockets inspired by skiing outfits. They might live in Berlin and show in Paris, but the Ottolinger designers are Swiss at heart\u2014and proud of it. Their heritage came through not just in their skiwear but also in a skirt printed with photos of a Swiss New Year\u2019s tradition in which townspeople wear versions of their own homes as hats for good luck. There are plenty of characters in the Ottolinger universe, but the glue that makes it coherent is that each is rooted somewhere in Bosch\u2019s and Gadient\u2019s personal reality. Maybe the best part of sci-fi is not to find another world but the ability to build one\u2019s own.

At an appointment in their East London studio\u2014just next to Markus Lupfer\u2019s\u2014Harding explained: \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking about whether a show is relevant to our women.

As for those garments, well, they looked good worn by Eden Clark in the printed photographs blue-tacked to the design studio wall, and they were fun to rifle through on the rack once talk turned to them. According to Harding (who, in the absence of Palmer on a fabric mission to Italy, was delivering the spiel), this collection was part of the ongoing interplay between his aesthetic, \u201clate \u201970s, when everything is soft, long, and exudes femininity,\u201d and that of Harding, \u201cin the early \u201980s when, bam, everything goes sharp, hard, and angular.\u201d There was plenty of focus on house signature shirting\u2014in collar shapes that morphed into storm flaps and decorative buttonhole edging and much more\u2014as well as a convincing exploration of out-there outerwear in house-developed fabrics.

It felt more contemporary casual than seasons past\u2014emphasis on casual\u2014but somehow still seemed more cohesive overall. The design duo had a joyful fall in mind, working in bright colors like poppy, fuchsia, and a rich azure. While their heavy helping of camouflage felt staid, their fabrics were developed even softer this season, from super-soft velour to micro-scuba. There was a P&G interlocked logo print, a moody floral, and their own twist on Chanel tweed: micro-scuba printed with a dense plaid, with brass buttons to boot. Ladylike details were present, too, with a detachable silken tie that added a few more grown-up details to bombers and short shifts, along with an exaggerated puff shoulder that was sprinkled throughout on knits and soft woven blends. Mixed in were the line\u2019s best-selling twills, mix and match tracksuits, and sporty side-striping.

They\u2019re timeless, keep-forever pieces for women who actually don\u2019t like to shop all the time; they shop when they find pieces they can cherish and wear over and over again. This puts Partow in the same realm as brands like Gabriela Hearst or The Row. She uses only the most beautiful, rarefied fabrics, and she\u2019s hyper-focused on the details most of us don\u2019t even notice, like the interior construction of a jacket or the bonded seam of a trouser. Partow is also among a small group of designers who create new textiles from scratch every season, usually with an inventive twist. Consider Pre-Fall\u2019s \u201cleather\u201d skirts and blouses, which were actually treated linen, or Spring\u2019s hand-painted, cable-knit cashmere. Fall 2019 included gray plaid trousers and column dresses with a subtle sheen, as if the fabric had been laminated\u2014but it was soft, not slick. Partow explained she\u2019d achieved the effect by placing the shimmer behind the weave, not on top of it. Also a clever trick of the eye: The hero coat in plush, cream-color shearling wasn\u2019t shearling at all, but a fluffed-up and tufted cashmere. In person, it looked and felt so convincingly like \u201cthe real thing\u201d that the only thing truly setting it apart was its lightness. Partow designed it as an alternative to heavy, weighs-you-down outerwear, but she also answered a question that\u2019s plaguing fashion at the moment: If you don\u2019t wear fur, but you also don\u2019t want to wear a faux version that\u2019s likely made from polyester or acrylic (i.e., plastic), what do you do? Now, there\u2019s a viable\u2014and seriously gorgeous\u2014option. That coat looked like the kind of thing you could throw over anything: a cocktail dress, like the bonded satin one that opens this collection, or a simple button-down and trousers, which are Partow\u2019s bread and butter. Fall\u2019s were a bit more oversize and androgynous-looking than in the past; she said she was loosely inspired by the way older men dress. She\u2019s interested in \u201cuniforms,\u201d and for plenty of men, the button-down-and-trouser combination is exactly that.

Christopher de Vos and Peter Pilotto tend to look for print inspiration in unexpected places, and this season they found it in the holographic works of Zsolnay, the famed Hungarian ceramics brand. Colored in shades of woozy brown and pink, the resulting patterns recalled late-1970s wallpaper. There were other references to the world of interiors, as well, including a mottled red velvet pajama-style suit replete with tassels to rival the drapes of the fancy venue. Like several London designers, De Vos and Pilotto have been thinking along quintessentially British lines lately. Their checked woolen jumpsuits and skirtsuits were finished with glittering crystal-encrusted buttons and spun with Lurex thread to fit the more-is-more mood. If that weren\u2019t decadent enough, the feathered trimmings satisfied the opulent brief and were used liberally on mini bags and pussy bows where sequins might once have ruled the night. That said, the unabashedly high-wattage nature of the collection could have been toned down in places.

PH5's pleat game was strong, seen best in a bubblegum-pink tea-length skirt with a snug, body-conscious fit. What felt newer were the diaphanous, poetic dresses in a metallic Lurex yarn from Japan, which lent the practical fabric a sense of whimsy. Functionality and versatility are keywords for Zhang and Lin, who frequently fly back and forth from the factory in China to oversee production and experiment with new and sustainable yarns.

The trouble concerned Kanye West, or rather Kanye West by proxy, and an allegedly fraudulent agreement that purportedly cost Plein nearly $1 million. The invite to Plein\u2019s show made mention of a live performance by West. When his wife, Kim Kardashian West, kiboshed that claim on Twitter, speculation started to grow and reports surfaced that someone in West\u2019s circle had apparently engaged in performance-fee negotiations, forged West\u2019s signature, and obtained a deposit from Plein, all without West knowing. Or, that someone may have been Malik Yusef, a friend of West\u2019s, who said the figure was $750,000 and that Plein had donated it to West\u2019s nonprofit for a chance to work together. Yusef also claimed that the money had been returned. Was Plein pseudo-Billy McFarland\u2013ed? Maybe. Are some people feeling a bit of schadenfreude? Likely. But it\u2019s hard not to feel, to an extent, bad for Plein. He was just trying to throw a party. Did he want to comment on the situation? \u201cNot really. In the end, the show is about doing something for the people, all my friends, and [putting] on something that represents us,\u201d Plein said. A lower-key night ultimately unfolded in Plein\u2019s favor. It was a fun, somewhat casual (albeit black-tie dress code) get together at The Grill (the ex-Four Seasons restaurant), where guests ate, drank, and mingled. The pressure-cooker vibe that used to come with this designer\u2019s shows was gone\u2014Plein has, smartly, scaled back his theatrics in recent seasons. The clothes were still brash, but mostly tolerably so. Plein said that this was his second cowboy-inspired collection\u2014but in that, it wasn\u2019t so nail-on-the-head. \u201cThere\u2019s more of a focus on the sartorial,\u201d he said. That amounted to more of a futuristic country-western: Dresses came dazzled and belted within saloon-style buckles, while bursts of neon tartan (like on a blazer) or color blocking (like on trousers) added an in-your-face jolt. The Plein moniker was given a sci-fi spur with a new font, while camouflage and animalia motifs worked its way in. Cowboy boots walked out with fluorescent leather detailing or elongated fringe, and there were some sharp-enough tuxedo jackets near the presentation\u2019s end. The edit was all over the place, but nonetheless, this was Plein doing what Plein does best, and, thankfully, in a more relaxed way.

Serafini typically references the \u201980s or the \u201970s, so this was a shift. It meant much of the soft romance and most, if not all, of the ruffles so associated with his Philosophy label were absent this season. Instead, there were hard edges both literal and figurative. Pants had the straight-leg, mid-rise shape that Helmut Lang put his stamp on, and tuxedo jackets were mannish in their proportions, just this side of oversize. Naturally, there were slip dresses, because nothing says the 1990s quite like slip dresses. A long-sleeved dress in bias-cut white lingerie satin with a lace-trimmed slit was particularly fetching. But most of the lengths were short, short, short. Serafini showed them bare-legged above lace-up, kitten-heel ankle boots. Bella and the gang looked sexy as all get-out. You could believably see any of them choosing the looks they were wearing for a fun night of parties. The simplicity of the shapes had a lot to do with that.

It was shot at Villa Borsani, a Rationalist gem built in northern Italy in the \u201940s by Milanese architect and designer Osvaldo Borsani, and recently opened to the public. Titled Chasing Light, the film is a delicate, poetic portrait of a girl caught in a romantic moment in time. Collaborations with female artists were brought about by the two designers as a way of giving the label a credible connection with the zeitgeist. Since their arrival, they\u2019ve been working at updating the house\u2019s codes while sticking to what the label stands for: a practical, versatile, and elegant daywear style, restrained but not severe, bourgeois but with a twist of gentle modernity. So far this choice has proved successful. Retailers seem more than happy. For Fall, the collection read as a well-edited urban wardrobe affair, with daywear taking center stage, designed with neat minimalistic lines softened by subtle, gentle details. A streamlined micro houndstooth city coat with a studded collar was worn over matching flared pants; an ankle-grazing riding coat in soft black double wool-cashmere felt both easy and chic. Pantsuits were also a strong point, proposed in tailored masculine versions in pin-striped wool or light tweed; they were apparently inspired by a \u201970s Helmut Newton picture of Charlotte Rampling, beautifully androgynous and impossibly chic in a single-breasted blazer and slim cigarette pants."}, {"Designer": "Plan C", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Carolina Castiglioni launched her label, Plan C, only last season, yet the outing has already proved successful. The collection has been picked up by major international retailers, and a flagship store just opened in Tokyo. Yet at today\u2019s presentation, Castiglioni didn\u2019t boast and kept her usual cool. Dressed in one of her creations, a long, techno taffeta tiered black skirt and a dark chunky knit sweater, she said: \u201cI just do what I like and what I\u2019d like to wear.\u201d The Castiglionis (a fashion dynasty, since Carolina\u2019s parents, Consuelo and Gianni, founded Marni in 1994) are passionate about art and design; their taste, albeit cultivated, isn\u2019t bourgeois or chichi in the least, but rather tinged with an idiosyncratic streak that the designer has inherited and translated her own way. Her aesthetic is artistic and expressive, and a touch experimental in its penchant for big, at times challenging, volumes and its high-tech\u2013meets\u2013artisanal take on elevated streetwear. The playful boldness in the use of saturated, vivid color-blocking and the consistent, thick-verging-on-stiff Japanese fabrications that she favors are becoming somewhat of a signature, showing that behind her composure, the young Castiglioni has chutzpah. Her Fall outing felt like an evolution toward a more accomplished proposition, with some softness creeping in, smoothing the edges of the utilitarian and mannish flair she favors. Cases in point were a feminine dress in pleated printed silk with trailing ribbons, and an oversize sweatshirt printed with graphic motifs worn over a striped knitted skirt in bright colors. A quilted pale yellow pouf miniskirt looked delightful, paired with an oversize Shetland ribbed cardigan; a long feathered necklace-scarf, wrapped around the collar of a voluminous herringbone-wool zippered waistcoat, added a touch of whimsy. Long, billowy gowns in techno duchesse satin appeared somehow regal yet ironic, worn with thick ribbed sweaters or oversize, patchwork windbreakers to unconventional effect. Fashion today is looking for distinctive voices, able to stand out and surprise with a unique, personal vision.

The so-called imperfections were barely discernible at first glance, though they were present in the collection from the start, in the extended lapel of a check blazer, say, or the too-wide paneling along the leg of a pair of billowy trousers. The most obvious examples came through in bright orange and black wallpaper patterns that were printed slightly askew across pristine white shirting and Prince of Wales check slit skirts. Perhaps the chicest of Cagalj\u2019s happy accidents was a soft blue blanket coat in which it was impossible to tell where one sleeve ended and another began. In a season of all-enveloping outerwear, this one was a standout. Still, Cagalj is a pragmatist before anything else. Any grander conceptual impulses are tempered by her fascination with textiles. This season she set about re-creating the feeling of fur in a modern, cruelty-free way, hence the translucent sweater dress that was spun with fuzzy mohair stripes, a cozy antidote to cocktail hour. The series of evening dresses that were layered over pants and wrapped around the body were a nice reimagining of the classic LBD, too.

He visited Kathmandu, Nepal, for a photo exhibition supported by his foundation; India for a lavish wedding, at which he outfitted the bride and most of her party; and other places besides. The trips gave him his motif for Fall 2019: suitcases of the world. \u201cAll of us are more similar than we are different,\u201d he said backstage. His new collection picked up where his last left off. That one was a celebration of his roots, filtered through an athleticized New York lens. Here, Gurung left the sporty element by the wayside, preferring to set South Asian elements against crisp American sportswear \u00e0 la Bill Blass, 7th Avenue star of the \u201970s and \u201980s. (Gurung worked for a time at the label after Blass\u2019s retirement and before he launched his own line.) The juxtaposition came together most explicitly in a gray pinstriped blazer worn with hot pink brocade cargo pants that were woven in Varanasi, India\u2014it was a more winning combination than it sounds. More often, though, Gurung de-emphasized the New Yorkiness of his history in favor of the wider world. There was a terrific ikat-print dress with sari draping; a whole series of pieces made from that colorful Varanasi brocade; and tulle and velvet party clothes alight with hand-painted metallic ombr\u00e9 illustrations of the Taj Mahal and various other South Asian landmarks. Grace Elizabeth\u2019s sparkling halter top and trousers would be a kick to wear. Gurung added YSL and Lacroixisms to the story as well\u2014they\u2019re the two designers he idolizes, after Blass\u2014but those tended to mix his metaphor.

In that show Prada included a smattering of women\u2019s looks from her Pre-Fall collection, as she is wont to do: utility-strapped and pocketed cocktail frocks, crystal-embroidered shirtdresses constrained by leather harnesses, combinations of graphic rose prints, wacky lightning bolts, and loose-gauge knits. In their quirky and bold juxtapositions of pedigrees, details, and textures, those clothes were indeed \u201cFrankensteinish\u201d and all the more compelling for it. (She also gave Gigi a feathery shag for the night, and boy did that spark a thousand snips!) Tonight Miuccia Prada continued her exploration of Shelley\u2019s canonical invention, this time giving him a bride (literally, on a sheath dress worn by a bleached-browed Cara Delevingne) and positioning him at the center of a larger sociocultural critique of our times, which she feels are defined by \u201cromance and fear.\u201d First, one must note that it was a fearless decision on Prada\u2019s part to show a women\u2019s collection that did not come as a total surprise to its audience. There are many in fashion for whom the Prada show is like Christmas is to children who haven\u2019t yet learned they can influence Santa: surprises abound! Why does the set have spiky foam floors? Why does the hair resemble Wednesday Addams\u2019s? And who ever thought to record a violin cover of \u201cBad Romance\u201d? Some people love Prada because they want to be gobsmacked, dazzled, schooled, and basically aesthetically woken up in the slumber that is Fashion Month. But those folks forget one thing: Miuccia is a serious person and one who is right now very concerned about European conflicts, wars, and the threat of war more generally. That is all she wanted to talk about postshow. And those sorts of thoughts and the creative impulses they give rise to don\u2019t change in five weeks just because the industry prefers novelty. It\u2019s simply not that moment. And so, instead, we had a Prada collection that continued to posit romance in all its aesthetic gestures (lace, flowers, hearts, fairy-tale capes, and glittery red shoes) as a way to both soften and deepen the tropes of utilitarianism (uniforms, puffers, cargo details, pole climber boots, backpacks). The most successful looks had the subtlest integration of wide-eyed loveliness and lumbering dread: an off-the-shoulder party dress of rough, dry wool with a curvaceous skirt made shapelier with a massive patch pocket; a slouchy black trouser suit cinched at the waist with a vaguely mannish clasp; a compound military jacket with a nifty blue shirt and a black lace pencil skirt. For the Prada-philes among you, please note that the bags were largely framed purses, the shoes were mostly either massive and mannish or a sturdy pump in matte black or all-out sparkle, and the trendy buys probably involve 3-D flowers or pastel Muppet fur (cute in small doses). And Prada-philes will love this collection because it was, at its core, very, very Prada. Not because there were, as ever, many great swaggering coats. Not because the dresses nodded to a demented Kim Novak or an inscrutable Eva Marie Saint. Not because there was a shoe in balletic pink with a plexi-heel, or a thick-soled brothel creeper for one of those slushy-streets, death-of-sex dates. It was very Prada because it spoke so clearly to the twin impulses that both define and daunt the Prada woman: I know what really matters and I also really love fashion.

But when the models came out, they were wearing clogs\u2014factory-worker footwear that dates back at least to the 19th century. They also read up on Maypole dancing, Morris dancing, Scottish reeling, and other forms of traditional British country dancing that still survive at village fetes and holiday gatherings. Thus references to grunge, Victorian petticoats, kilts, and Morris men\u2019s costumes got caught up in their Fall collection. Anyone who ever drove up a motorway to dance all night at an illegal rave in a field\u2014as Thornton and Bregazzi did\u2014will clock the snippets of blankets and the cozy outerwear as fragments of that memory. Their signature pantsuits got jazzed up with the tonally matched Morris-dancing rosettes and streamers. Later, there was a moment for more glammed-up partywear, the kind of poufy, puff-sleeved dresses that London girls wore to clubs like the Titanic and Annabel\u2019s in the early \u201980s.

Pringle has been creating this kind of all-knit dressing since the 1930s, and it was from that elegant era of sports and skiwear that Stringer most drew. There were high-neck dresses, jumpsuits, and blanket capes worn over Breton striped roll-necks and thick-gauge sweaters with built-in corsets and caped backs. All this layering was neatly finished with balaclava hoods and Stephen Jones\u2013designed peak caps. Stringer cleverly mined her material, using everything from sharp merino chevron wool to loose cashmeres. \u201cIt\u2019s all about showing the versatility of knitwear,\u201d she said.

Beatrice, one of Dante\u2019s \u201cblessed in heaven,\u201d closed the show in a shimmering white short-sleeved gown.

Mannish proportions were softened by the deconstructed knits worn underneath the suits and the flashes of bare skin they exposed. Hernandez and McCollough also revived the pleated dress silhouette that\u2019s been successful for them in the past. Here, they did it in compact knits with sash details below the bust.

Leba has always looked to vintage style as a source of creative direction (usually with a music-related backstory) and this time around he married his favorite fashion era, grunge, with something more hand-me-down and handmade. It felt like his craftiest collection yet, one filled with thoughtful details like lace bibs layered beneath embroidered vintage tees and floral-print 1950s house dresses cut with slits at the sides to give a more undone appearance. Leba also repurposed old workwear jackets and decorated fraying blazer lapels with some of the beautiful little pins and crystal brooches he scooped up back in Austin and during his other travels. It\u2019s hard to imagine how some of the pieces will be reproduced for stores, but it was certainly nice to see Leba step away a little from his usual nods to rock \u2019n\u2019 roll legends and focus on his own handiwork.

You might say that the collection\u2019s insistence on dazzle, what with its bright colors, its eye-catching prints, its slightly hallucinogenic embellishments, and its club kid accouterments like tinsel and plastic paillettes, was emphatically anti-burnout. But, you could note as well, that the intergenerational mood that Comey was teasing out also included a yearning for coziness and comfort. There were a lot of plush, fuzzy, blanket-like textures here.

Humans have their own way of producing magic, too, and among Mishra\u2019s points of differentiation is that he relies almost entirely on handwork, whether spinning and weaving his wonderfully lightweight fabrics or crafting all the vegetal embroideries and delicate lace. As he pointed out backstage, this means that no two garments have the same composition. But thanks to a coherent message of stylized tartans and windowpane checks in black and ivory, the lineup nonetheless felt coherent. As usual, the coordinated looks were fluid and flattering, spanning unstructured A-line frocks, well-proportioned tunic layers, breezy dresses over dresses, ample pants, and various tailored jackets.

Leading lady Cate Blanchett clearly got the memo. The Australian actress, who was one of several celebrities who attended the show, appeared on the scene in a cool tuxedo-style black jumpsuit to make Daisy Buchanan reconsider her flapper dresses. That classically tailored silhouette, known as Le Smoking to the French, was the cornerstone of the collection. It\u2019s a natural starting point for Lauren, who honed his approach to womenswear 50 years ago by adapting men\u2019s shirting and suiting, first for his wife Ricky, then for Diane Keaton, who wore some of his earliest pieces on-screen in Woody Allen\u2019s Annie Hall. With a crystal-studded herringbone overcoat thrown over her shoulders and a bow tie to fasten her tuxedo shirt, Gigi Hadid seemed to be channeling that energy as she sauntered around the tables to the sound of Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cNight and Day.\u201d There were primary-color variations on the theme, too\u2014satin tuxedo jackets in red, blue, and yellow\u2014though the strongest were cut in classic black and white, including one that came with a luxurious velvet robe in place of a blazer. About midway through the show, Hadid\u2019s younger sister Bella glided down the runway, switching the show into high gear with a show-stopping red sequin gown. It was a reminder that Lauren understands the standalone power of a gorgeous red carpet dress. Still, the best cameo of the night was yet to come. With her tiny frame perched on five-inch platform heels, Janelle Mon\u00e1e took to the stage in a halter-neck tuxedo dress with a billowing tulle and plaid skirt. She performed a medley of Jazz Age anthems, including an electrifying rendition of \u201cLet\u2019s Face the Music and Dance,\u201d bringing the whole audience to their feet. (By that point, Mon\u00e1e was in full cabaret singer mode; having kicked off her shoes, she was climbing on tables and prowling around the room on hands and knees.) Lauren, who sat with his family in the crowd after taking his bow, appeared to be fully immersed in the experience when Mon\u00e1e handed him the mic for an impromptu karaoke session. Like all the most memorable movie moments, it was totally unscripted."}, {"Designer": "Raquel Allegra", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cIt\u2019s a moment captured on a garment,\u201d Raquel Allegra said of the storytelling she likes to convey with each piece she designs. Except this season she reframed her approach, focusing more on the artistry of the tie-dye process itself, referring to the many \u201chand-painted\u201d pieces that punctuated her Fall 2019 collection. \u201cWhether you\u2019re using a brush or a bottle with color,\u201d she said of the various methods for delivering dye and imparting colors to garments, \u201cyou\u2019re putting the color on fabric in a painterly way. And each fabric is done individually, like a painting would be.\u201d That fresh perspective lent a new lens to the collection. Instead of a single inspiration, Allegra relied on the individuality of every piece, trusting they would work together as a whole, which they nearly always did. The eye was drawn to Allegra\u2019s rich color combinations, including jeweled jade, cobalt, violet, and wine red, that made her relaxed suiting separates in crepe-backed satin feel sleek. Her knits, thick, textured, and never without their signature distressed details, took on a bit of trend this season, with intarsia and appliqu\u00e9, even a jewel accent. Strong too were silk damasks, left over from previous seasons, that Allegra patchworked onto hems, inserts, collars, and pockets, a new step into sustainability for the designer, who started by repurposing old T-shirts from the Los Angeles prison system. And as she does each season, Allegra delved into a new material. For Fall, she chose corduroy\u2014unexpected for a designer who gravitates toward silken blends, but fitting for the season. The new fabric looked strongest in a loosely tailored Jade trench and a black work shirt that erred a bit more punk. It worked with the rest of the collection, and stood out as a singular piece on its own, just as Allegra intended."}, {"Designer": "Re/Done", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Starting with the Fall 2019 collection, Re/Done\u2019s tags won\u2019t just have their logo on them: They\u2019ll be labeled by the decade. A double-breasted blazer in crisp taupe wool was marked as \u201cThe New \u201970s Jacket,\u201d for instance; a straight-fit denim mini was \u201cThe New \u201990s Skirt.\u201d Why \u201cnew\u201d? A vintage precursor inspired nearly every piece, but Sean Barron and his team aren\u2019t in the business of making copycats. They\u2019ll tweak the fit and fabrics for our 2019 tastes, knowing that if a piece feels too nostalgic or too on the nose, it veers into costume territory. Barron was quick to point out that they won\u2019t be designing \u201cjust \u201970s collections.\u201d Instead, each collection will have pieces cherry-picked from the past, which mirrors how the Re/Done girl gets dressed. Maybe she\u2019s into \u201990s jeans and \u201980s motorcycle jackets, or she\u2019ll mix the new \u201970s corduroy flares with a \u201990s Kurt Cobain\u2013inspired fuzzy cardigan. Even the sweatshirts nodded to specific decades: Barron\u2019s team found a vintage quarter-zip sweater and was inspired to track down the zipper manufacturer, which offered up its archives. Barron dug up the exact zipper and used it for his new pullovers, so the results were part old, part new\u2014which sums up the Re/Done aesthetic pretty succinctly."}, {"Designer": "Rebecca de Ravenel", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "One critique stood out to Rebecca de Ravenel after her Spring 2019 presentation: Her mother (and lifelong inspiration) told her she loved the new clothes, but couldn\u2019t see herself actually wearing any of them. The spaghetti-strap eyelet day dresses and off-the-shoulder gowns\u2014often in sweet fruit and daisy prints\u2014had a youthful vibe that resonated with up-and-coming starlets and the Instagram set. But plenty of De Ravenel\u2019s customers are a bit older, whether they\u2019re in their thirties or they\u2019re closer to her mother\u2019s age, so Fall was designed\u2014more confidently\u2014with them in mind. The lookbook set is rarely worth mentioning in a review, but for De Ravenel, it was surprising to see a stark black backdrop here. As an interior designer, she typically likes to \u201ccreate a world\u201d with her setting\u2014usually an apartment\u2014designed in conjunction with the clothes. But in an effort to really zero in on fit, construction, and fabrication, she scrapped the idea in favor of a traditional shoot. What didn\u2019t change were her far-flung references: Recent trips to Turkey and India influenced her prints, like the blown-up paisley lifted from a vintage brooch she discovered in an Istanbul bazaar. A pale pink silk with single orange blooms scattered throughout was inspired by an Indian sari, and the color palette\u2014pomegranate, violet, turquoise, turmeric\u2014nodded to both destinations. Unlike the cherry and apple motifs from Spring, those prints had a more grown-up and worldly quality. The silhouettes were where De Ravenel made bigger changes: Several dresses came with longer, more modest sleeves, including the raspberry knit one De Ravenel was modeling this morning. It had the feeling of a soft pullover, but looked crisp and elegant. The designer also introduced a new category: 100 percent cashmere suiting. Younger women might wear the soft plaid blazer with vintage jeans, but De Ravenel\u2019s mom would likely take the full look. As for the earrings with which she launched her brand in 2015, De Ravenel made shiny plated-gold versions of her signature Les Bonbons (a tip from Jeffrey Kalinsky, one of her mentors in the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund) and experimented with semi-precious gems for the first time. The translucent, raw-looking stones on a pair of long earrings were actually amethyst. They\u2019ll be considerably more expensive than Les Bonbons; girls looking for an update in that space should bookmark the silk-cord \u201cpomegranate\u201d clip-ons (complete with rhinestones for seeds!). Price isn\u2019t the most exciting topic to discuss at a preview, but De Ravenel admitted most of her ready-to-wear pieces are up there in the \u201cdesigner\u201d range; she doesn\u2019t compromise on fabrics and develops most of her prints from scratch. A luminous orchid gown in a high-pile, leopard-spotted velvet was so costly, it won\u2019t even be produced; with the Oscars coming up, it\u2019s a pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance intended expressly for the red carpet."}, {"Designer": "Rebecca Minkoff", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Fashion week can feel far removed from the realities of life, but this season Rebecca Minkoff set her sights on 9 to 5 dressing. \u201cWorking women inspired me, the girls in our office, real people on the street,\u201d shared Minkoff at her studio. \u201cI began the Female Founder Collective last year, and it reinvigorated me.\u201d The platform, which connects female business leaders and fosters awareness of women-owned businesses, served as a fruitful starting point for a collection centered on comfortable options for day. Minkoff covered her bases, moving from the casual (souped-up sweatshirts with puffed sleeves and jeans detailed with playful zebra prints) to the corporate (monochromatic power suits comprised of oversized blazers and cropped pants with a modish flair). Both sides of the spectrum proved palatable, but the dressier pieces packed more oomph. Contrasts of texture served to amplify several of the key motifs. Slacks are infinitely more interesting when they have a coat of glossy PVC, while a range of metallics made pleated skirts and bomber jackets feel distinct from the versions already occupying space in most closets. Fluffy textures on feathered bags or plush shearlings were a welcome touch, as was the news that they\u2019d be offered in vegan and non-vegan versions so that customers could purchase while \u201cstaying true to their ethics.\u201d The collection\u2019s most exciting development might be its foray into inclusive sizing; partnering with Stitch-Fix to expand her range Minkoff assessed a mountain of data before finalizing her Spring output. \u201cI wanted to do things right, not just size up,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe had so much information about what the customer was looking for.\u201d Granted, it doesn\u2019t take a data dive to know that a gold crackled leather jacket will resonate across sizes, but Minkoff\u2019s diligence bodes well for her brand\u2019s latest endeavor."}, {"Designer": "Rebecca Taylor", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Having moved to Paris last summer, Rebecca Taylor has been spending much of her time in galleries and museums: the Mus\u00e9e National Picasso, the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, and, more recently, the Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Arm\u00e9e at Les Invalides, specifically its collection of military uniforms. Taylor has always been an army-pant-and-Victorian-blouse kind of girl, and on the phone from her new apartment, she said she was fascinated by the way military garb has influenced our modern wardrobes. The epaulets on the shoulders of our coats have buttons because soldiers used to secure their bags there, for example, and pin tuck pleats were originally added to shirts and trousers so the wearer could let them out if need be. There were subtle military references in Taylor\u2019s new Fall collection\u2014the pink padded jacket, the check double-breasted coat trimmed with brass buttons\u2014and a few racks over, there were some great cargo pants from her little-sister line, La Vie. The warm, earthy shades of rust, cantaloupe, and burgundy were drawn from a different museum: Taylor stumbled upon an Henri Matisse painting with similar rich hues in Pablo Picasso\u2019s personal collection. Coupled with the collection\u2019s leaner, less-frilly silhouettes\u2014a bias-cut tie-neck dress, a curve-skimming midi skirt, a double-face melon suit\u2014the effect was distinctly elegant and grown-up.

In an unusual move, this show started with a designer statement projected on the backdrop which read: \u201cThis show reflects upon a time when the rebellious power of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was harnessed to promote social change. A time when rock stars stood firmly alongside activists to fight injustice and rocked the world into a better place. We believe fashion can also be an agent of change.\u201d And he is absolutely right: In this show alone, Bella Hadid changed, like, three times. Her last look, and the final on the runway, appeared fiendishly tricky to achieve and consisted of a silver sequined minidress grafted into a bias-cut, satin-lapelled black tailcoat. This was also the summation of the key heavy metal reference that ran through this collection: Alice Cooper and his \u201cvaudevillian\u201d (as Moratti rightly put it) way with a tailcoat. Megadeth\u2019s \u201cPeace Sells\u201d and Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cWar Pigs\u201d played as Moratti riffed hard on that starting point via red sequin and crystal and red-on-black animalia-pattern tailcoats. Like last season, there were plenty of short-as-hell, un peu YSL minidresses with dramatically oversize bows or shoulders. More meaningfully Moratti-esque were the leather day-to-night looks that mixed crystal-set leather pants with animalia-patched leather bikers. All of that leather, with the exception of some of the boots, was vegan, and what fur there was, was faux.

One gown looked as if it was covered in glittering watercolors, with swirls of red and blue sequins and tiny chains strung across it. There was also a gold dress made of actual metal spangles that looked like it was dripping off of the model, almost as if she was a stunning, melting Oscar statue. The piece was unbelievably heavy\u2014this writer tried to hold all 15 or more pounds of it like a dumbbell\u2014but Acra knows comfort just as well as she knows how to make a piece shine in a megawatt way. She had sectioned the dress so the weight was equally distributed between the bottom and top halves. Hefty dresses aside, Acra is revisiting her separates.

It was late 2016 when New York lost Suno, the socially responsible brand headed up by Erin Beatty and Max Osterweis that specialized in craft with a side of quirk, bold colors, and prints on prints. Now, after an absence, Beatty is back on the NYFW calendar with a solo project, but much has changed in the two years since Suno closed: More midsize New York brands have closed their doors, Trump was sworn in, and climate reports have gotten grimmer by the month. On the upside, Beatty had a second child. All are factors that contributed to her new way of thinking about fashion, production, and what comes next for her. \u201cFiguring out who I was without Suno, I went down the wormhole of sustainability,\u201d Beatty says. \u201cAnd what a wormhole it is. Eventually I decided I was thinking too big. I thought, What if I make something beautiful out of something that already exists? I was only buying vintage for myself anyway. With the dismemberment of trends, the only thing that feels new is something weird.\u201d Introducing Rentrayage, a collection made entirely from secondhand and vintage garments. \u201cYou will not see a single thing that\u2019s new,\u201d she promises.

Her mood board for Rentrayage is a dense collage of references: Christo and Jeanne-Claude\u2019s Floating Piers, an old friendship book with braided locks of hair, images of hand-painted tiles, and vintage Martin Margiela collections. \u201cPeople like Margiela and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons have done this before me,\u201d Beatty says. Still, Suno fans will recognize her hand, especially in the playful dresses. The tailoring feels a bit newer for the designer, but it\u2019s satisfyingly sharp, especially the double-breasted blazer that\u2019s one part vintage YSL, another part menswear check. Beatty came across the term rentrayage in the children\u2019s book Cloth Lullaby, which tells the story of the artist Louise Bourgeois, who is another touchstone; it\u2019s a French word for mending or darning, which sums up her new project as elegantly as it does precisely."}, {"Designer": "Richard Malone", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "The agonies of Brexit are very real to the London fashion community.

Inevitably, European nationals in Britain are looking over their shoulders to consider what\u2019s on offer back home, should they need or be forced to return (and Dublin is currently booming as companies like Google locate there, rather than the U.K.). Malone found himself looking back with nostalgia to simpler times of village street parties when mothers opened their doors to all comers and people of all generations gathered in \u201cbadly lit community centers\u2014you know, the sort of thing you really hate as a teenager, but now think is fantastic,\u201d he laughed.

The designer has played host to a number of surprise guests\u2014most notably Her Majesty the Queen\u2014and today he invited Freya Ridings, the rising British singer, to perform on a grand piano that was lit by a gigantic chandelier. While last season Quinn chose to open his show anonymously (his model was completely swathed in black satin and tulle, down to the head covering), this time he kicked things off with a very recognizable face: Adwoa Aboah. With her roots spanning Europe and West Africa, the gorgeous model has come to represent a new kind of British beauty. She was dressed in an embellished tartan evening coat, and a model in a beaded houndstooth skirt suit followed behind her\u2014both looks picking up the thread of British heritage fabrics. Of course, Quinn\u2019s personal affection for traditional English motifs begins with florals. His many-petaled vision of modern elegance has earned him several accolades, including, most recently, the British Fashion Award for emerging talent in womenswear. And yet Quinn does not create clothes for wallflowers. There is a subversive energy beneath the surface of his eveningwear that speaks to Britain\u2019s rabble-rousing past. The latex bodysuits, tights, and opera gloves that were layered under pretty tulip-covered jackets and \u201950s-leaning maxi dresses recalled the radical fashion statements of Leigh Bowery, the performance artist who ruled the underground London club scene in the \u201980s. That layering technique was especially effective on a series of puff-sleeved, mini party frocks, one of which even came with a princess-worthy sparkling collar.

No one does post-apocalypse chic quite like him. But for Fall 2019, he was after something different. It started at his men\u2019s show last month, when he referenced Larry LeGaspi, a guy who designed costumes for Labelle, Kiss, Grace Jones, and Divine. Up until then, LeGaspi had been more or less an invisible designer, responsible for much, but getting little, if any, credit. In January, he didn\u2019t even have a Wikipedia page. Thanks to Owens\u2019s work, now he does, and a book too, penned by the designer with the blessing and assistance of LeGapsi\u2019s widow and daughter and due out from Rizzoli in August. \u201cIt\u2019s how I got through the \u201970s\u2014that kind of sensational flamboyance,\u201d Owens said backstage today, wearing platform Kiss boots. LeGaspi was up to taboo-busting, gender-bending, high camp, ultra-glam stuff, and as a small-town kid from California, Owens was dazzled. Fast-forward 40-odd years and he sees a similar kind of transgressiveness in the young people experimenting with prosthetics and body modification on Instagram. He hired one of them, 18-year-old Salvia (@salvjiia, NSFW, but definitely worth a look), to consult on the show makeup. Also contributing in absentia: the much celebrated American couturier Charles James, the subject of another new book, for which Owens wrote the introduction; and Mariano Fortuny, the Spanish-born, Italy-based designer who was famous for pleats and prints. It\u2019s the prints that factor here; Owens knows the Fortuny factory people from Venice, where he lives part time. Now that the opening credits are taken care of, a little about the clothes, which were inventive and daring and, considering Owens\u2019s recent preoccupations with outlandish volumes and otherworldly silhouettes, wearable in the extreme. He opened with tailoring: streamlined jackets and coats with sculpted shoulders. The first model wore her blazer over layered bodysuits, the top layer traced with studs at the crotch\u2014a reference, Owens explained, to LeGaspi\u2019s codpieces for the band Kiss. Like the looks that followed, it was very leggy: sexy, but not coy. Owens can\u2019t abide coy. (Don\u2019t get him started on miniskirts, which are all about vulnerability and coyness, and drive him crazy.) Fabulous silver-dipped ponyhair jackets constructed with the seams exposed\u2014shoulders almost like wings\u2014conjured images of Kiss in their concert regalia, too. The second half of the show was focused on evening. Thick swaths of Fortuny-printed jersey spun asymmetrically around the torso \u00e0 la James, only his grand ball skirts were missing in favor of hip-slung wraps trailing floor-scraping trains. Bias-cut blood red columns were more covered-up, but no less sexy considering the gestural, figure-hugging way Owens draped them. The red dresses seemed like they could be nodding in the direction of the red gown LeGaspi\u2019s wife, Val, wore to their sole appearance at the Costume Institute\u2019s Met Gala in 1979.

This mod aesthetic worked well again for Rodriguez in the bulk of the collection\u2019s looks. There is little room for error in pared-back closet staples like a black leather croc-embossed skirt or an optic white undone-pussy-bow blouse. While some of the print combinations were distracting (like a pant and top that combined floral and geometric patterns), the more standout examples of prints were striped wide-leg suits that could be worn as separates. Speaking of\u2014these oversize, mannish suit silhouettes have been popular on the street style front, and the Insta-influencers will predictably gravitate. These are looks that women will keep in their closets and rotate season after season, year after year. They\u2019re also basics that look and feel undeniably high quality, even far from the rack, especially the outerwear. That includes a camel-hued cashmere robe coat with the button placed toward the side of the neck, so the collar of the piece elegantly folds over. Another cozy cashmere robe coat was a hit, this time striped in gray, black, and light blue, the sort of classic that will outlast any trend."}, {"Designer": "Roberto Cavalli", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "The creative director\u2013heritage house relationship is more arranged marriage than love match. There\u2019s no guarantee things will click. Paul Surridge\u2019s tenure at Roberto Cavalli has been slow to heat up. As a menswear designer by training, and one with a minimal touch at that, Cavalli\u2019s more-is-more-is-more vibes aren\u2019t second nature to him, but nearing the two-year mark, he\u2019s settled in and is receptive to feedback. Surridge started off today with one of Cavalli\u2019s signature tiger prints. His idea was to abstract it using many colors so it didn\u2019t look quite so literal. The results on a round-shouldered but otherwise sharp double-breasted coat were bold, like we expect from Cavalli. The show ended with a white tuxedo, its sartorial aspect nodding more to Surridge\u2019s own roots than the house founder\u2019s. In between, the designer negotiated that balance, sending out a steady mix of body-conscious numbers in black rib, say, or a sheer tattoo motif, and \u201cperfume dresses,\u201d house parlance for the billowy pliss\u00e9 frocks it uses in fragrance advertising. These appeared alongside more of the clean tailoring he likes, which he gave womanly curves by cutting the trousers with a super-high waistband and tapering the legs above the ankles. The menswear looked assured, and gutsier in its way, than the womenswear. Especially Cavalli-ish was a jean jacket silhouette embroidered all over with two sizes of silver sequins in that abstract tiger pattern. Surridge should try a few more gutsy things like that on the women\u2019s side next season."}, {"Designer": "Rochas", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "There was a deliciously agonized aesthetic derangement in this Rochas collection that sometimes played on the eye as costume for some fantasy Fellini-shot remake of Belle de Jour. The Italian auteurship was provided by Alessandro Dell\u2019Acqua, who said he had wanted to mine the house\u2019s couture roots\u2014like, of course\u2014and whose clothes spoke in deeply bourgeois codes while simultaneously signaling a climax of volumized apostasy against them.

One model wore a skirt in that fabric south of a raw, V-neck mohair sweater over a shirt in white silk so light that its collar leapt toward the roof in a sun salutation every runway step. The interplay of Prussian blue silks and faux furs, shaggy in their caramel-ness, was twistedly yum. With no ill will in the world toward either party, this collection felt like concept-less Prada from another time: just very good, and aggressive in its womanliness\u2014clothes for a feminine identity that rejects masculine colonization, and whose apparent lack of control is, in fact, an act of it. Clever, clever clothes, which were maybe slightly wasted on this label."}, {"Designer": "Rodarte", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "This afternoon in sleepy and gorgeous San Marino, the sun and the stars came out for Rodarte\u2019s Fall 2019 collection\u2014and none of this can be taken for granted. The drenching rains that have caused havoc and mudslides in Southern California of late took a powder, but only after the Mulleavy sisters had moved their show indoors from the gardens of The Huntington Library to a flower-walled pavilion on the property. (Their Spring collection was presented in a downpour last September; this season, precautions were taken.) As for the stars, including Diane Keaton, John C. Reilly, Kim Gordon, Shailene Woodley, and Tracee Ellis Ross? They, too, added an unusual luster to the bedroom community that abuts Pasadena on a Tuesday afternoon, especially those who dressed in Rodarte: Brie Larson in hot pink point d\u2019esprit, Rowan Blanchard in violet tulle, Lucy Boynton in black and pink netting, the Haim sisters in frills and bows. If the question that often befuddles observers of the Mulleavys\u2019 fantastical designs is, where do you actually wear such things? The answer, it would seem, is anywhere you want to feel pretty and original. How about a cactus garden? And why not take inspiration from Ginger Rogers, Cyd Charisse, Judy Garland, Ann Reinking, or any of the icons of Hollywood musicals from the \u201930s through the \u201970s (and specifically All That Jazz)? This was the Mulleavys\u2019 starting point for a collection that moved between phenomenal and theatrical silhouettes (massive shoulders, palazzo pants, floor-sweeping gowns, waists cinched by logo\u2019d belts) and darling frocks of fragile lace or tulle embroidered with hearts and butterflies. A trio of sleeveless tulle evening dresses covered in black, yellow, and red hearts were especially charming. As in their Spring 2019 collection, black leather provided a counterpoint to all frippery, but it too was ruffled and ruched. A white coat of faux fur covered in little black bows blended elegance, wearability, and drama in one cool yet conscious piece. This was not a subtle show: the makeup was saturated and glittery; the floral headdresses were made of anthuriums (with their all-natural flashiness); the shoes were vertiginous, vinyl, made of clear plastic, and kinky as hell. There were logo\u2019d door-knocker earrings that mashed up K, L, and a heart. Squint in places and you might ask, \u201cHeathers?\u201d Or you might remember that moment in certain old black-and-white movies where a dance sequence or a fashion show would suddenly be performed in full Technicolor. In every sense, this was a very Hollywood show (and how nice that it was shown in the shadow of the studios). The line the Mulleavys continue to walk in all of their work\u2014fashion, cinema, performance\u2014between hard and soft, tacky and transcendent, erotic and innocent, horror films and heavenly visions, is compelling, challenging, and crazy fun to behold. To borrow from Beyonc\u00e9 (herself no stranger to musicals and iconicity), Rodarte trades in both sweet dreams and beautiful nightmares. Why turn the lights on?"}, {"Designer": "Roksanda", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "In what has been a strong Fall 2019 from London, it\u2019s the city\u2019s female designers who have really come to the fore. It\u2019s quite a roster of names: Simone Rocha, Victoria Beckham, Grace Wales Bonner, Margaret Howell, Molly Goddard. After Roksanda Ilin\u010di\u0107\u2019s colorful and confident show Monday morning, with its site-specific installation by the art collective Troika, we can easily add her to that list. But let\u2019s hold up here for a second: This isn\u2019t about making gross generalizations about the works of these women because of their gender. The real story is that their collections have been rich in strong points of view, and their individual voices\u2014different generations, different aesthetics, different beliefs about what women need\u2014are able to be loud enough without drowning anyone out. If anything unites them, it\u2019s that they so easily engage with the women who wear their clothes, who turn up to their shows looking terrific, regardless of age or size or anything else for that matter. They\u2019re not trying to speak to everyone, and why should they? They clearly know who they\u2019re already talking to. Ilin\u010di\u0107 has always had a fluent conversation with her audience. You want a statement-making evening dress, elegant but not stuffy, pretty without ever being saccharin? She has them aplenty: in yellow taffeta strewn with feathers, magenta duchess banded with mustard stripes before exploding into the latter color or on the back, or a show-stopping number in tobacco taffeta, which dramatically fell in billowing tiers to the floor. What impresses here is the sense of complicity. Despite its opulence, her eveningwear has a real sense of movement, never constricting or constraining, nor does it attempt to put women on some ridiculous pedestal\u2014something underscored by the nimble-footed slipper shoes or substantial white-heeled boots (a collaboration with Malone Souliers) the pieces were worn with. Yet the real takeaway from Roksanda for next season was the strength of the day clothes, from the oversize tunic-like shirts\u2014a recurring London theme\u2014in vivid hues worn with trousers cut with a gentle curve to them to one knockout piece of outerwear after another, with wadded silk-print scarves worn over a capacious jacket or coat that was then secured with a belt to the gleaming color-blocked nipped-waist parkas. On exiting the show, a colleague, clearly impressed, said, \u201cJust when you thought you\u2019d seen every variation on a parka . . . .\u201d So, there you go Roksanda: another convert to the cause."}, {"Designer": "Roland Mouret", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Backstage moments before he showed his Fall 2019 collection, Roland Mouret was reminiscing, thinking over the times when he\u2014and many around his age\u2014had to make do with what they had when they were putting together looks back in the day. Oftentimes it was an assemblage of vintage pieces and thrift-store finds that had to be made to fit, or worn just as they were, regardless of your gender or the assumed gendering of the clothes you\u2019d ferreted out. You just loved them because of how they looked, and how you made them look. Mouret, however, while being a designer who freely embraces romanticism and sensuality in his work, has never particularly struck me as someone who\u2019s sentimental for sentimentality\u2019s sake. If he\u2019s going to gaze back, it had better tell him something that he can work with and use today. Mouret\u2019s sentimental journey led him to this: The Fall collection was shown in all the sizes it is available in, from a UK 8 to a UK 20, irrespective of the size of the model it was shown on. It was true of the dusky-pink super-fluffy supersize trenches, the enveloping bisected graphic knit coats, the ever so slightly oversize rust tweedy blazer over one of his terrific sinuous dresses in the same earthy fabric and color. (I suspect you could give Mouret sackcloth and he could wield the scissors along the bias and turn it into a thing of beauty.) And just to underscore those past memories, he threw some guys into the show too, wearing women\u2019s pieces, but in the most naturalistic and easy way: a big trench shrugged on, slouchy wide pants trailing the floor, tunic-like shirts. They didn\u2019t register as men\u2019s, or as women\u2019s; just something great and new to wear. Actually, there was a lot that was great and new to wear here: the sharpness of a sky blue blazer and scarlet pants, or a perfect slinky and slithery black and gold dress. Mouret\u2019s point with all this was straightforward. Maybe we spend too much time thinking about who should be wearing what. And we have most definitely, he said in that preshow chat, been thinking too much about limiting the idea of which bodies are beautiful; the fetishizing of size zero as body zero for fashion has taken us so far down the wrong road, not least the way so many in the industry won\u2019t fess up to selling sizes far bigger than the typical runway sample. If one had a single quibble about all of this, it might be that the show could have done with a little more diversity in size in the casting, but still; Mouret is a designer whose business has been unabashedly built on dressing (and ergo celebrating) women of all shapes and sizes. He has always wanted women to feel comfortable in his clothes\u2014and in their own skin."}, {"Designer": "Romance Was Born", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Ruffled, spotted, quilt-edged, feathered-fringed, and crystal-studded, this Romance Was Born collection was characterized by designers Anna Plunkett and Luke Sales as a party-centric nocturnal chimera. \u201cThere\u2019s a fantasy, mythological beast kind of vibration to it,\u201d pitched Sales via a WhatsApp voice call from Sydney as he returned home from the laundromat. Certainly the clothes featured plenty of dramatically inclined cutting and pasting. That animal print (sometimes drawn in quilt or sequin) was a mash-up of a cockatoo and tiger, further swirled by the swirling marbleized paisley that was featured in their last few collections. The botanical played gumnut against wattle yellow or constructed sequin waratah on silk. Black lurex was edged in finely rendered coraline ruffle. There were of-the-moment volumized tiered dresses in black with sheer bell sleeves that sparkled with a Jenny Kee\u2013touched colored-cut jewel pattern. Pale check dresses and a quilt-edged houndstooth bodice, high-cut kimono, and shorts set said \u201cyeah\u201d to the codes of menswear. These ingredients presented plenty of shifting, smokey polarities to flit between, all in an evening-centric, fishnet-accessorized collection whose domestic customers will be dancing towards dawn in it as those drawn to Romance Was Born in the U.S. and Europe are on their commutes back and forth to work. Plunkett\u2019s and Sales\u2019s is a unique aesthetic crying out for wider distribution.

Rosetta Getty didn\u2019t bother with any of that as she looked toward her brand\u2019s fifth birthday. Instead, she decided to throw a party. Taking a somewhat different tack than usual, with her latest artist collaboration she bounced off the work of photographer and conceptual artist Kayode Ojo, in particular the series of nightlife photos he showed last year at Paula Cooper Gallery. Echoing Ojo\u2019s subversive take on the party-picture genre, Getty decided to put her own backwards twist on a familiar fashion concept: Rather than day-to-night dressing, Getty went for night-to-day looks, imagining a woman who, as she put it at her presentation day, \u201chas been out all night partying and goes straight to work.\u201d In practice, that concept translated into a handful of daywear pieces executed in formal fabrics, like a cinch-neck blouse in satin or a zip-up turtleneck dress in sparkly Lurex, and another handful that were adaptable in some way, such as trousers and skirts with long zips that could be used to change the silhouette of the garment. (Or, in the case of a vest-dress hybrid, its function.) Meanwhile, though the collection boasted its share of luxuriously cozy knits, a house signature, Getty tacked to a somewhat sharper tone than in most of her previous outings. Much of her customary diaphanousness was eschewed in favor of straight lines, and painterly color gave way to earth tones, often combined within graphic checks. Indeed, the one pop of color here was in the collection\u2019s chambray blues and its patchwork denim items, but even these had a coolly neutral tone. Overall, despite the party girl inspiration, these clothes had a rather businesslike mien. Perhaps Getty was adhering to another common practice among anniversary-celebrating designers: Trying something new as they look ahead."}, {"Designer": "Rosie Assoulin", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Rosie Assoulin is known for her sculptural, statement-y evening gowns, to the point where it\u2019s not uncommon to hear \u201cWhere do you wear Rosie Assoulin?\u201d or \u201cWho\u2019s buying it?\u201d Those showstoppers stick out in your mind for a reason: They\u2019re big, bold, and have influenced an industry-wide shift toward expressive, less-stuffy eveningwear. But to focus only on the fancy stuff is to do a disservice to Assoulin, who designs tons of low-key, versatile pieces for every collection. Think: crafty sweaters, crisp shirtdresses, wide-leg trousers, and her line of cute vegan shoes. Low-key was the overall vibe for Fall. There was a new emphasis on daywear in general, though attempting to label an Assoulin piece as \u201cday\u201d or \u201cnight\u201d is pretty futile. What do you call a banker-striped button-down tucked into wide-leg silk trousers with a built-in crimson overskirt? You might say it\u2019s too elaborate for day, but too casual for evening . . . and the Rosie Assoulin customer loves that off-ness. She delights in it. The ivory silk cargo pants and draped \u201950s-ish cowl blouse nailed a similar balance\u2014dress them down with sneakers or up with spangly heels\u2014as did the plaid wool suits, which came with meticulously foiled strips of silver pressed into the pattern. The full look would go \u201cblack tie\u201d with the right accessories, but Assoulin\u2019s younger fans will just pair the blazer with jeans. Her more casual pieces are often lavished with that same attention to detail, but Assoulin felt compelled to keep things simple and vaguely earthy this season. A poplin shirtdress was trimmed not with crystals, candy buttons, or tassels, but with narrow strips of vegan leather. A similar look came in beige viscose, which felt like linen but won\u2019t wrinkle the second you sit down on the subway. Smart! Ease of wear and comfort were emphasized in Assoulin\u2019s evening pieces, too: Aside from the handful of major, nipped-waist gowns in color-blocked faille, most of her dresses had a softer touch, like the drawstring gently cinching the waist of a striped dress. It\u2019s worth mentioning that only a small percentage of this collection actually felt like \u201cfall\u201d pieces; even the forest-green plaid suits were spun in cotton so you can wear them in any climate.

Garrett, who served as designer for the men\u2019s portion of the collection, kept things simple with turtlenecks and trousers in vivid mustard, and ecru suiting as worn by a distinguished male model with matching hair. Power couples were on the mind, with iconic \u201990s twosomes like Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow, and Winona Ryder and Johnny Depp providing inspiration for pairs of complementary looks.

Of late, the designer\u2019s signature hybridizations have been asymmetrical; her garments have been different from side to side, which is a whimsical but quite demanding proposition for the wearer. For Fall, Abe took up volume and proportion play. It made for her most winning and wearable collection in some time. Backstage, Abe said she started the work by thinking about the clothes she wore when she was young; she liked to layer Ralph Lauren\u2019s kids\u2019 button-downs over vintage dresses. On the runway today, that small-over-large idea translated into a double-breasted herringbone coat clasped by a cargo-shirt corset, or a generous khaki trench made snug through the chest by a shrunken surplus green vest. Rather ironically, the young-girl experiments resulted in quite couture-like silhouettes. Still, what will appeal about these pieces is their practicality. A shrunken cable-knit puffer-parka combination is grandly statement-making, but it won\u2019t fail to keep you warm. It was a point Abe said she was eager to reinforce. Her print was based on the floor of the studio where Jackson Pollock made his famous drip paintings. \u201cTo most people, Sacai has an abstract philosophy,\u201d she said through an interpreter. Hence Pollock, who was the most abstract of painters. \u201cBut when it\u2019s put together, it\u2019s more concrete and real.\u201d There were also bandana-pattern embroideries and extrapolations on Fair Isle designs. Still, it was the outerwear that really connected. The marvel of Abe\u2019s Sacai designs is, as particular as they are, that they don\u2019t date. A Fall 2014 jacket, for example, looks as vital now as it did five years ago. That makes Sacai a clever investment.

Hopefully, others will get the message."}, {"Designer": "Saint Laurent", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "How should a creative director address the legacy of the designer whose house they inherit? It\u2019s a question made newly relevant by the passing of the great Karl Lagerfeld in Paris last week. And it\u2019s a subject that came to mind as Anthony Vaccarello\u2019s superconfident new collection for Saint Laurent marched past\u2014starting with look number 2, a broad-shouldered, ivory wool coat modeled by a 21st-century doppelg\u00e4nger of the YSL muse Betty Catroux, complete with signature sideswept peroxide mane and black shades. Since his arrival nearly three years ago, Vaccarello has seemed comfortable to explore the parts of Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s legacy that most closely align with his own\u2014briefly: anything short, short, short. But spanning 40 years as it does, YSL\u2019s oeuvre is vast. Vaccarello\u2019s latest explored several eras or moments of that legacy, but the aspect that had everyone in the audience so jazzed tonight was the tailoring, which was strong, almost man-size, and focused on the shoulders. In a preview, Vaccarello said he spent six months getting the proportions right and that they were built up with padding to extend two centimeters beyond the shoulder seams. \u201cThe show pieces are all done by hand,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to figure out how to perfect it [in the factory].\u201d Vaccarello is loath to psychoanalyze his motivations, but many in the audience were fully prepared to do so. There\u2019s an old-fashioned rivalry brewing in Paris (something that YSL and Lagerfeld knew plenty about, as it happens; read The Beautiful Fall for all the fabulous details), and competition, as they say, is good for business. As for why Instagram lit up afterward with photos of those boss coats, Vaccarello does have a theory. \u201cShe\u2019s not making war; she\u2019s not a combatant. But she is really strong; she\u2019s fearless.\u201d Many of us respond to that silhouette, especially in our current dark times. The designer\u2019s other subjects this season were YSL\u2019s Opium moment and the haute couture \u201cScandal\u201d collection of Spring 1971. The former produced all manner of lavishly worked beaded evening jackets, worn with micro-shorts, Swiss-dot stockings, and knee boots for a modern vibe. The latter was Vaccarello\u2019s Pop reinterpretation of Saint Laurent\u2019s own revisionist take on World War II\u2013era clothing, which was critically panned at the time but went on to become influential in the street. This section of the show was harder to see, with the models walking behind a wall of glass, in black light, with a Yayoi Kusama Infinity Room mirror situation behind them. Vaccarello has made a signature of these \u201csecond acts,\u201d but this collection hardly needed one. He had most of us at that coat inspired by Betty Catroux."}, {"Designer": "Saks Potts", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Welcome to Spa Saks Potts! Given the perennially sunny disposition of Danish designers Cathrine Saks and Barbara Potts, is it any wonder they prioritize self-care? The season\u2019s inspiration struck twice. First, on a jaunt to Therme Vals in Switzerland, a stark monolithic spa that sits atop a bubbling hot spring. Second, a trip to Ladda, the airy little Thai massage and acupuncture parlor on the aptly named Rue de Paradis, where their first Paris presentation took place. \u201cActually, Barbara and I went here to get a massage six months ago and thought it was such an amazing space to step into,\u201d Cathrine explained. \u201cWe like to not only be in Copenhagen, so we wanted to do something here.\u201d Guests walked through an austere courtyard and lobby, following a series of clear SP logo stickers that had been stuck across drab carpet. When one finally arrived on the spa\u2019s seventh floor, it was like reaching a French health oasis. Sensual saxophone sounds boomed over the speakers, and towels folded into the shape of nuzzling swans sat here and there. Mineral water was served alongside cucumber sticks wrapped in some leafy green and glass bowls filled with bracken starch jellies, and the rooftop terrace delivered a breathtaking view of the city, bathed in amber light from the just-setting sun. As for the clothes, models lounged happily around the room in more of the brand\u2019s beloved outerwear. Their wildly successful fur-trimmed Foxy coat returned as a murky light-green number trimmed in curling Mongolian lamb, to which they added a black-and-white logo print and crowd-pleasing patent neon orange. \u201cThis is only a small selection of what we\u2019ve made,\u201d Cathrine said. \u201cWe also did one in neon pink.\u201d Head-turning highlighter hues were a focal point, as seen in the magenta hooded stretch jumpsuits (an implausible proposition, until you saw Barbara wearing a nice beige one) and the shimmer-coated Lycra separates like a glittering orange tube dress. \u201cIt gives a little bit of a glass feeling,\u201d Barbara added. Though they are wise to revisit these fan favorites, Saks and Potts are eager to expand their range. Thus one saw the introduction of d\u00e9grad\u00e9 puffer and mink coats of equal street-style appeal as their Foxy, a reflective silver nylon parka and skirt set, and the first Saks Potts bikini, which was printed with yin and yang symbols to nod to that self-balancing theme. The little fur bags were also promising, like the tiny white mink tube, tucked just under the arm, plus a weirdly appealing white terry cloth duffel that\u2019s part of an entire \u201ctowel-themed\u201d capsule that will drop in April. Though color is their strong suit, neutrals like a camel-colored yoga pant and sports bra nicely offset the other half\u2014that yin and yang principle in action."}, {"Designer": "Sally LaPointe", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "A flurry of very anxious PR emails, echoing the hailstorm occurring outside, set the tone for Sally LaPointe\u2019s Fall 2019 show. To counter the dismal atmosphere, the designer sent out another chromatic progression of looks, this time inspired by Elvis. More specifically, LaPointe had recently watched his \u201968 Comeback Special, in which the singer delivered a television performance in a plunging black-satin shirt and red neckerchief. It\u2019s unlikely one would have guessed the reference, as LaPointe thankfully steered clear of the obvious signposts. The closest homage may have been Look 3, a plunging leather bodysuit with a kerchief, though hers was cinched tightly at the waist and cropped at the ankles. She used real snake on three grayish looks, an interesting choice given the wave of exotic skin bans occurring elsewhere. (Including Victoria Beckham, as of yesterday.) LaPointe\u2019s label has long been about the modern luxury of its fabrications\u2014lavish fox-fur sleeves and leather, piled with sequins and sequins. This obvious brand of glamour appeals to a certain kind of woman, who may not care overmuch about sustainability or ethical fashion practice.

He\u2019s had a fast rise at this Italian leather goods house; it was just 2016 when he was brought in to handle footwear. Though ready-to-wear is new to him, he\u2019s put Ferragamo on solid ground. You don\u2019t have to scroll too far back through the seasons to see that. Andrew\u2019s approach to ready-to-wear has been to start with the shoes; \u201cdressing toe to head\u201d is the way he put it. Fall began with a shoe from 1942, a multicolored patchwork suede wedge that\u2019s a kissing cousin to the famous 1938 rainbow platform made for Judy Garland. It provided the collection\u2019s kaleidoscopic palette and the patchwork motif that ran through it. Not that it ever got too theme-y. The vivid colors he\u2019s adopted aside, the Ferragamo aesthetic under Andrew is understated and elegant, a point he has reinforced with his multigenerational casting. The sensationally chill Liisa Winkler scored the show\u2019s hero piece, a generously proportioned robe coat that looked like shearling but was actually fleecy pulled cashmere. That coat silhouette also looked great in a bordeaux-hued leather. Under designer Guillaume Meilland, the menswear standout was a neatly tailored three-button coat with silk satin lapels\u2014classic but with a wink. There was a whole family of shoes on the runway, from dainty flats sprayed with crystals to satin tango numbers to knee boots with angular heels inspired by a 1968 shoe from the archive. There was some variety to the handbag offering, as well. Though the emphasis seemed to be placed on frame bags, the one that caught the attention of the editors in section A was a soft suede hobo with a long shoulder strap in a winning shade of pistachio green."}, {"Designer": "Sandro", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Sandro missed a trick when it presented pretty ruffled blouses and dresses printed with cowboy boots in looks that also featured cowboy boots: It should have printed the garments on the shoes to complete a perfectly symmetric referential knot. That is the only real criticism of a winning collection that was a nicely judged mishmash of \u201980s uptown and Western seen through a commercially minded Parisian lens. A tr\u00e8s chic blue trench coat with a pleated back, various pieces of tailoring in houndstooth (called pique de poule, or \u201cchicken feet,\u201d in French), printed or metallic woven jacquard dresses, and jacquard suiting all hit the Madison tone. The Western contamination began in frankly Chanel-y boucl\u00e9 jackets hemmed in acid-washed denim, then carried over into fringed overcoats, the boots, the printed blouses, and so on. It was a simple formula nicely executed with a lip-smacking twist of tacky\u2014Lurex leggings, that acid wash\u2014which the mixologist fixing mocktails at the door of this crowded presentation would have surely hat-tipped."}, {"Designer": "Sandy Liang", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Last season, Sandy Liang was thinking about what her clothes might look like on a runway. She\u2019s always shown her collections with intimate presentations in restaurants (her father\u2019s eatery Congee Village for Spring 2019; her close friend Danny Bowien\u2019s establishment Mission Chinese for Fall 2018), and Liang was beginning to feel like it was time to shake things up. Today, she took a baby step toward a new format with a gathering for Fall 2019 at a small gallery space on Canal Street. Models walked out and through the crowd before taking their places stationed around the room. It wasn\u2019t a full runway by any means, but it was a pivot for Liang, and one that she was very excited about. She was also excited about the fact that this outing included her very first unisex capsule collection of outerwear designed with her signature leopard- and camouflage-print fleece and neon trim. After many of her guy friends, and a lot of other stylish men, started buying and wearing her women\u2019s fleeces, Liang wanted to strip away the gender lines and make them available to everyone. In addition to the tightly edited capsule of jackets and coats, Liang also aimed for a fuller ready-to-wear collection that married feminine silhouettes and detailing with sportier vibes. She accomplished this with adorable tulle-trimmed puffers and black gingham prairie dresses made with anorak fabric. Liang\u2019s crystal-bedecked skinny jeans and her scribble-flower-sketch embroidery were also nice this season, even as she described the latter motif as \u201cnot messy enough.\u201d That\u2019s the thing about Liang: She\u2019s constantly perfecting and tweaking her brand, even if it means making something look a little more undone or wild. She\u2019s a shrewd businesswoman, too, not only because she listens to what her fans want, but also because she understands that sometimes in fashion, slow and steady baby steps often win the race."}, {"Designer": "Sara Battaglia", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Sara Battaglia went for an all-out party vibe in her Fall collection. To make her point, she presented it in a private nightclub ensconced in a basement in Milan\u2019s city center, a dark space padded in voluptuous blue velvet, with smoky lights and a louche atmosphere. The mood was bold and playful: \u201cI wanted to do something fun\u2014a girl who\u2019s smiling while she gets dressed to go out,\u201d she said, stunning in one of her shapely pantsuits in purple lam\u00e9. Battaglia is definitely the perfect alpha model for all of her creations. The designer favors strong, impactful shapes: powerful shoulders, a cinched waist, and rounded, feminine hips. Here, she didn\u2019t stray from her signature silhouette. Her pantsuits are as sexy as any body-con dress, with hourglass-cut, double-breasted blazers and fitted, flared pants to get the legs-for-days effect. They were proposed in bright orange velvet, topped by voluminous yellow faux-fur coats to spectacular effect, or in pink-and-white houndstooth-printed wool, the jacket elongated to become a duster. A power skirt suit in white with slanted hems would look apropos for an apr\u00e8s-work cocktail. In Battaglia\u2019s world, it could even go straight from the boardroom to the dance floor. The disco vibe was in full swing for the \u201980s-inspired evening minidresses, theatrical and flamboyant in a sensuous way. Lacquered red eco-leather was molded into sculptural banana-shouldered mini shifts, while bright purple lam\u00e9 was shirred into figure-hugging draped dresses.

It looks more like a cool blouse tucked into paper bag\u2013waist trousers than your typical all-in-one: There\u2019s an asymmetrical pleated neckline, giant buttons, split sleeves, and reverse seams that create the look of being flipped inside out. In creamy, substantial cotton, it\u2019s the kind of one-step outfit you could dress up with heels or down with sneakers, and it fits nicely in between all of the mechanic\u2019s boilersuits and vampy Studio 54 jumpsuits you can find elsewhere on the market. A paper-y slate-blue dress had a similar pleated-and-buttoned neckline, a novel new \u201cembellishment\u201d for a brand known for more decorative embroideries, lace, and crochet. Minimalism with a side of quirk has been Monahan\u2019s M.O. for the past couple of years. Fall\u2019s sleek experiments included cotton blouses with dramatic ties at the neck; slim, button-front midi skirts; tie-dyed shirtdresses (hand-done by an artist in Los Angeles); and an ultra-luxe, double-face cashmere coat with sleeves roomy enough for a big-shouldered Sea blouse. As for the high, ruffled necklines and oversize eyelets, Monahan joked that Paolini always manages to slip in a few frills. This season, she was particularly inspired by Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s famous collars; she watched the documentary RBG on a flight back from Paris and was instantly transfixed."}, {"Designer": "See by Chlo\u00e9", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "This season, See by Chlo\u00e9 took its girl to the English countryside and dressed her in a cozy autumnal assortment of knits.

Elsewhere there were speckled d\u00e9vor\u00e9 dresses, swirling peacock-color paisley on all manner of items, easy raw-edged silk blouses, and a whole lot of turtlenecks.

But the sleek, asymmetrical, embellishment-free jumpsuit she wore pushed the brand forward in a single look. Backstage, Chong said he wanted to streamline his silhouettes and simply make it all feel a little bit chicer. The tuxedo dress spliced with a panel of pleated silk felt like the midpoint between past and present Self-Portrait; it gave Chong\u2019s love of collage a more grown-up bent. A puffed-sleeve cherry red gown with a spray of sequins was a contender for the collection\u2019s best party dress\u2014as opposed to the shorter, lavishly detailed frocks we\u2019ve seen in prior seasons. For the dress-averse, there was a single-sleeve jumpsuit with a narrow row of crystals. In lieu of his usual graphic lace, embroideries, and embellishments, Chong layered second-skin Lurex-striped knits under midi dresses and off-the-shoulder frocks. The trick was less convincing on the orange-and-blue checkered dresses, but it reflected how many women want to look right now; instead of \u201cjust\u201d wearing a dress, those underpinnings add a subversive, covered-up-yet-sexy touch."}, {"Designer": "Shaina Mote", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "On a recent trip to Italy, Shaina Mote couldn\u2019t help but notice the way the women were dressed. Her intrigue was sparked on a particular stroll through Rome, when ladies passed her wearing layered cashmere knits and big scarves wrapped around their necks. Mote was also moved by the juxtaposition of landscapes between the capital and the small towns of Puglia, between the ornate, Old World architecture in the city and the organic, serene landscapes of the country and seasides. Generally speaking, Mote\u2019s designs evoke this sort of push-pull between richness and minimalism, and this season, her dichotomous approach to fashion was more apparent than ever. On one end of the spectrum was a luxurious camel wrap coat with oversize sleeves and, instead of a typical collar, an attached scarf that enveloped the shoulders. On the other end were lighter pieces, such as a draped sky-blue blouse and a liquid-like crushed taffeta dress in ivory that featured a drawstring down the bodice. Mote also looked to the saturated architectural images of Fran\u00e7ois Halard, mainly those he\u2019s taken on trips to the Villa Medici, Casa Malaparte, and Cy Twombly\u2019s home in Gaeta, Italy. These portraits were evoked in the organic earth tones of the jumpsuits and outerwear, as well as in the pretty gray suit that was tied with a sculptural bow and hung perfectly on the body. Mote is a designer who has a strong grasp of her own vision, and she\u2019s been wise to take her time in perfecting it over the past few seasons. Fall 2019 marks the point in her career where she\u2019s hit her creative stride, and, with a new store opening soon in Los Angeles, she\u2019s building up a successful business, too.

This season, for example, she found herself drawn to pleating techniques specific to the tailoring workshop. The accordion-style finish loosened up the look of a classic pencil skirt and a trenchcoat, and was a nice alternative to tuxedo stripes along the legs of a pair of silk cream pants. There were some interesting explorations with asymmetry as well; one coat with contrasting gray panels on either side and a matching staggered slit skirt were among the best pieces in the collection. Wauchob drew on her Parisian connections for the couture elements in the collection, including the dramatic bias-cut evening gowns in lipstick red and pink and the pliss\u00e9 and feathered embellishment on cocktail-hour looks.

This Grecian narrative sprung to life over the summer, when Weiland had immersed herself in the feminist odysseys of author Madeline Miller and the \u201cMythos\u201d audio book of English wit Stephen Fry. \u201cI was drawn to these strong figures of femininity and power,\u201d she said. \u201cThe stories of Greek mythology are so much about culture and art, and that\u2019s why I wanted the girls to walk out from this backdrop like living myths.\u201d Weiland\u2019s gang of goddesses were clothed in prom dresses in polka dots and playful, mythological prints of Weiland\u2019s own design, whose beautiful puff sleeves and fitted bodices nodded to the \u201980s.

Dramatic floor-sweeping coats and capes came in a light and feathery woollike faux fur, with twists and coils that mimicked the spools of yarn you would find in a knitting shop. The show\u2019s fruit-salad palette of apricot, banana, and orange gave rise to a checkerboard print that resembled Battenberg cake, which covered knits, tights, and coats. And what of the bags, whose sales have seen an enormous increase over the last few seasons? Here, the pearly powers of her best-selling Antonia bag (named after Antonia Marsh, the Soft Opening art gallerist who introduced her to Driscoll) took on the structure of treasure chests and shells, in a nod to Amphitrite, goddess of the sea.

(It\u2019s worth noting that Rams also used the Golden Ratio that has so defined Neigum\u2019s work.) After studying a book on couture sewing techniques, he landed on the cartridge pleat as the recurring motif of this slimmer season. \u201cCartridge pleats are kind of the analog version of the new pleats I started last time,\u201d Neigum said; he worked to intertwine these old and new methods. He cut six meters of fabric to create the elaborate cartridge-pleated cuffs on an abstract tie-dye blouse, for instance; another cartridge pleat ran in ruffles across a bandeau top, which Neigum layered over a ribbed stretch dress with a surprisingly fresh abdominal cut-out. Elsewhere, he showed a bonded wool jacket and skirt with a reflective coating and a boxy turtleneck and floor-length knit dress, basket-woven with thick white and black yarn to add dimension.

A nod to the \u201870s is apparent throughout, not only in the earthy fall palette of chocolate browns, forest greens, and mustard yellows (with some bright fuchsia and disco-worthy glitter thrown into the mix), but also in the mega-platform Raid boot, the retro-inspired stretch lamb leather suit, and the profusion of plaids. In fact, this season features four custom plaids in an array of fabrics on everything from ruched skirts and cargo pants to tiered dresses, trench coats, cropped military jackets, and bustiers. The city\u2019s influence, meanwhile, is evident in the Trekker Hiking Boot (available in the aforementioned plaid and glitter) and a quantity of tees and sweatshirts embroidered with the line\u2019s logo\u2014a Los Angeles uniform if ever there was one. Hollywood\u2019s party girls will doubtless be drawn to the glitter-encrusted denim, bags, and knee-high Slant boots. \u201cSilver has always done well in the collection,\u201d says Hansford, pointing to a silver crackle shearling, full-length silver foil trench coat, and oversize silver lunch-bag totes. On the accessories front, it will be interesting to see if the new Fir bag, with its sculptural acrylic chains (sold separately and worn by Hansford hanging from her jeans like a key chain), can lure customers away from the cult Bonsai bag that blew up the brand on Instagram in the first place. \u201cThat success was really what gave us the confidence to branch out into these other areas,\u201d said Hansford. Coming full circle, the standout Fall denim offering is a paint-splattered (by hand) black jean and jacket inspired by a painter\u2019s oil palette that features in both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s collections, bringing the two evolving sides of the label back together\u2014perhaps over a cup of coffee at the Beachwood Cafe."}, {"Designer": "Simone Rocha", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "There was such a strong feeling of pan-generational female empowerment at Simone Rocha\u2019s show today. The instinctive response to the rare sightings of Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Jeny Howorth, Jade Parfitt, Lily Cole, and Lindsey Wixson on the runway sent a thrill of delight rippling through the crowd. Their head-held-high attitudes proved that Rocha\u2019s collection of full-skirted belted coats and dresses isn\u2019t meant only for girls. Looking more closely at the clothes\u2014the organza see-through layers of trenchcoats, the bodices and bras caught in deshabille, the bloomers glimpsed in the back-views of skirts\u2014it was obvious that there was something deeper going on beneath the surface. Sure enough, as Rocha started talking about it, her collection transpired to be a study of female eroticism, and the ambiguous tension between being an object of desire, and wanting to own and direct it. It was about intimacy and privacy, security and insecurity,\u201d she said. Pretty and compellingly wearable as Rocha\u2019s clothes are\u2014and this season\u2019s casting went further than ever to underline that\u2014there was a something dark lurking within her research. On one level, she said it came from looking at the work of the film director Michael Powell, who made The Red Shoes, and then the controversial horror movie Peeping Tom, about a voyeuristic cameraman serial killer who murdered women as he was filming them. (The movie\u2019s sadistic content was regarded as so outrageous that it was banned for a long time, and effectively ended Powell\u2019s career.) On another level, the collection was an honoring of Rocha\u2019s formative attachment to the work of Louise Bourgeois, whose themes in themselves were also a startlingly honest struggle between tenderness and sexuality, often expressed in fabrics and textiles. \u201cI found her series of weavings which she\u2019d made with fabric from her own clothes particularly beautiful,\u201d the designer said. The spiderweb embroideries and prints Rocha used on her puffball coats and dresses were made in collaboration with the Louise Bourgeois foundation. What to conclude, here? On her press release, Rocha included a quote from Bourgeois about the instinctual aspect of her art, and the fact that she felt no need to justify or explain it. The meaning is in the eye of the beholder, the vibrations of feeling she takes from it."}, {"Designer": "Simonetta Ravizza", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Simonetta Ravizza tried to move away from fur this season. For a scion of a family of renowned Italian furriers, it wasn\u2019t a small feat. Yet she knows she has to keep her options open and adjust to the times. So she focused her offering on outerwear, proposing a series of slightly oversize masculine-inspired coats, patchworked from different textures and fabrications: boucl\u00e9 wool and Prince of Wales macro checks, or leopard-print kid combined with shearling. She also offered long piumino coats in bright-colored nylon lined in checkered wool, worn over high-waisted, \u201980s-inspired leather pants, a recurring theme throughout the collection. Fur made an appearance mostly as a decorative accessory on collars, cuffs, and removable hood-stoles; as a lining for sporty nylon parkas; or else in the small Furissima bags clasped as charms to leather belts. A few fur coats and chubbies in mink or fox were kept simple and practical, luxurious but not ostentatious. Ravizza also introduced a menswear capsule, proposing classic wardrobe staples veering toward the sportif in shearling, leather, and boucl\u00e9 wool.

Ironically, the designer had planned to stage the event at the Museum of Chinese in America on Centre Street, which aims to preserve and present the history of Chinese life in the U.S. Though Gao\u2019s circumstance may have been bureaucratic, it was impossible not to reflect on the walls being built around this country, the divisions running through it. Photographs across the museum showed the same story from decades ago\u2014anti-Chinese propaganda, the painful othering of nonwhite faces. In the face of these sobering issues, Gao chose to buckle down and make a plaintive statement through her continued blending of cultural dress codes. This season, she drew from her upbringing in Beijing and the recent years she\u2019s spent in New York, as filtered through the work of Sun Wen, a Qing Dynasty painter who made a similar plea for unity. So Gao returned to her signature Chinese silk dresses spliced with crisp suit jackets, though with dramatic drop shoulders that firmly suggested the \u201980s. A graphic snowflake print resembled both a tacky American necktie (a Father\u2019s Day gift, perhaps) and a statement-making qipao, cut into a delicate wrap dress with coat. It was great to see Gao simplify her silhouettes, as she can at times over elaborate the construction and layers of each piece. There were printed silk lounge separates without any mixing or mashing, and two floral brocade suits whose tailoring stood out. Also nice: the intarsia knits and patch-worked habutai slip skirts, which got the cross-cultural message across in an easy yet elegant fashion."}, {"Designer": "Sonia Rykiel", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Last season, the mayor of Paris unveiled the newly christened All\u00e9e Sonia Rykiel, not far from the late designer\u2019s Saint Germain des Pr\u00e9s shop. This season, creative director Julie de Libran took the \u201cborn from the streets\u201d idea of Rykiel and ran with it. The label shot a lookbook rather than staging a show (a notable absence from the Paris Fashion Week calendar), hiring five French models and sending them out onto the avenues and rues of the city. \u201cIt\u2019s not about fashion,\u201d De Libran said at the showroom, \u201cit\u2019s about the iconic values of the house.\u201d Rykiel began designing under her own name in 1968, when the pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter category was being born. Unlike many of the other heritage brands in this city, there\u2019s no affiliation with haute couture. The icons of the house are stripes, knitwear, and a playful sort of femininity, more coquette than seductress. So this \u201creal world\u201d approach suits the spirit of Rykiel. It also jibes with the direction the industry is going. At the moment, overly designed and conceptual collections feel pass\u00e9. De Libran\u2019s stripes this season are lively and multicolored, inspired by a kaleidoscope. And there was novelty in her knits, including a pullover cut like a sporty-outdoorsy fleece and a fringed top and skirt set made from a new machine that\u2019s proprietary to Rykiel (not pictured in the lookbook). Among the highlights: a super-wide-wale corduroy pantsuit, and a black velvet dress embellished with fringes of sequins. At the start of her run, De Libran presented her collections in the Rykiel flagship. The store would be a charming compromise between this lookbook and a fashion show; it would give us a chance to see these real-world clothes in action."}, {"Designer": "Sportmax", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "At first, it seemed strange that Sportmax chose as its soundtrack the very same \u201cbit of the old Ludwig van\u201d\u2014Beethoven\u2019s 9th Symphony\u2014that featured so prominently not only in A Clockwork Orange but also last month\u2019s (outrageously good) Undercover menswear collection. Yet, once the models completed their rangy traipses up and down the elevated runway of blush sand, it sort of made sense: This was a gang of 21st-century female droogs who had wrought ultraviolence upon the hallowed citadel of menswear suiting for their own fashion gratification. A gray jacket had its arms slashed from its body, and a blue jacket front\u2014itself most probably the victim of some other tussle\u2014thrust upon it. Two more jackets had been mercilessly razored at the waist to provide each side of a jacket-skirt beneath a nylon shirt masquerading as a white one. When there was a fully functioning two-piece, albeit one hybridized from a wool in two shades of gray, it seemed an act of relative mercy (that looked good). Impressive here were the round-shouldered outerwear pieces engineered in a wool-cashmere mix in navy or gray that lent a tough, pumped-up shot of steroids to the silhouette. The most prominent examples were a blue bomber with a shearling-paneled front worn above a three-split matching skirt and a full-length gray jacket. It wasn\u2019t solely suiting that was adapted from menswear and then attacked from a fresh direction: In black or caramel leather, there was a great deal of luxury harnessing and tactical wear, sometimes worn separately, or not, as with two raincoats into which were integrated jerkin-like leather inserts\u2014which will surely get rain-stained if ever worn in a storm. Combined with the fabric baseball caps and high leather boots, all the holstering and harnessing sometimes made these seem like directional paramilitary attire.

It\u2019s a label with a lot of resonance among women of a certain age, but one that remains mostly unknown to their daughters and their daughter\u2019s daughters. This season\u2019s offering was smart in the way that it played to all of those customers: a sophisticated sequined black knit evening top and matching pants for the longtime fan of the brand; a striped, multicolored long-sleeved dress with a pleated skirt and an unlined knit jacket, meant to be paired with jeans or a black-tie gown, for the St. John neophyte. The outerwear also targeted a diverse group of shoppers. There was fuzzy leopard for the Insta-concerned woman, and a beautifully tailored camel overcoat for her well-heeled, more classically chic counterpart. Overall, the new collection presented nice textural elements and a range of easy, highly wearable separates and silhouettes.

Today he starred on the sweater in Look 6 of this Stella Jean collection. The designer played fast and loose with Louverture\u2019s narrative by presenting him as a woman. In 2019, why not? This interesting and attractive offering looked at narratives cultural, colonial, and (in that sweater) gendered, and then presented them\u2014as is any author\u2019s privilege\u2014from a subjective point of view. What authenticated that point of view (something especially important in Italian fashion right now) was its anchorage in Jean\u2019s own identity as a Haitian-Italian. As she said backstage: \u201cIn this collection, our bourgeois young lady made an inverse grand tour\u2014the kind of cultural trip made in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. But here she starts from tropical destinations like French Polynesia and Haiti, and then she arrives in the Old Europe, which you can see through the still lifes inspired by the Dutch artistic tradition.\u201d As well as these Willem Kalf\u2013like images, Jean showed faux-na\u00eff representations of Pacific beach scenes informed by Gauguin printed on striped woolen coats. There was a consistent emphasis on intersecting lines of color aka check\u2014itself reflective to this eye of the north-of-the-border cultural touring the English were wont to do in the age of Sir Walter Scott. Patterned beading on belts and slippers looked drawn from various African and South American decorative traditions; lining details on check coats were reminiscent of the Dutch print that remains such a mainstay of African apparel. Jean said: \u201cThis is a suggestion to a new generation that the principal cultural attractions are not all in Europe, and that you don\u2019t have to go to tropical destinations only for the sun and the beach. There are deep cultural, literary, and artistic histories in all the countries that I travel to in Africa or Central America or South America.\u201d She is, of course, correct. Like a pattern of check over zigzag in one of Jean\u2019s full-skirted jacquard coats, all of these narratives\u2014most especially historical\u2014need to be appreciated for the apparent contradictions and particularities that make them what they are. She added: \u201cI think it\u2019s important to talk about my multiculturalism.

A quick pass through this year\u2019s LVMH Prize showcase is proof of that: Most of the 20 young semifinalists are working with deadstock fabrics and materials that would otherwise be destroyed, or they are generally thinking along more earth-friendly lines. One is even constructing garments out of old airbags. Stella McCartney is an industry leader on this subject\u2014has been for years. But she\u2019s never foregrounded her initiatives on the runway quite like she did today. To start, there was her rainforest conservation project. The idea is to dedicate a tree to a loved one and, in the process, raise awareness of the at-risk Leuser Ecosystem in Indonesia, where many of the 150 million trees cut down each year to make fabric are logged. Love messages were printed on the catwalk, and they are also visible on Instagram via the hashtag #thereshegrows. It\u2019s McCartney\u2019s answer to the Ice Bucket Challenge, only its beneficiaries are elephants, rhinos, orangutans, and tigers. According to a press release, the viscose McCartney uses for her collections is harvested from certified sustainably managed forests in Sweden. But that\u2019s just the beginning of her work around the topic this season. She used strips of vintage tees as if they were yarn to knit a multicolor sack dress, and fabric from previous collections to create the quilted details that decorated the yokes or bodices of easy-to-wear frocks. The show-closing coat pieced together from those past-season materials was a real stunner. Cheeky jewelry, like shoulder-duster earrings made from paperclips and a long necklace embellished with rubber bands, reinforced McCartney\u2019s endeavors around upcycling, as did a monumental woven belt made by the noted textile artist Sheila Hicks. Rounding out her collection, McCartney addressed tailoring of the laidback and more polished variety, from an army surplus all-in-one to a form-fitting blazer tucked into high-waisted cargo pants. Last month, the designer discussed sustainability in an interview with Vogue Runway\u2019s Emily Farra. \u201cI need a few more colleagues linking my arm,\u201d she said.

Still, Rae said she wanted to make pieces for modern women who work in every field and setting: \u201cFashion is so performative, and I wanted everyone\u2014no matter what class they\u2019re in\u2014to look fabulous.\u201d The voluminous silhouettes and ultrabright colors indeed looked fabulous, but they were ultimately quite personal to Rae.

Yes, the body-enveloping shapes of the \u201980s returned on their runway (and some of the songs too), but Symonds is a deft and innovative patternmaker, giving his pieces boxier proportions and an intentional slouchiness. \u201cI take a lot of shaping out of garments. I just crush it out, so you get this very, kind of\u2014I suppose it\u2019s quite a square fit for a woman, but it also has a loose utility feeling. There\u2019s always a sense that the body is underneath it,\u201d Symonds told Vogue\u2019s Mark Holgate before the show. Safari suiting and knickerbocker shorts were the mainstays of the collection, remade in vintage fabrics. Dunmoy tea towels acquired on eBay were draped into jackets, and vintage William Morris curtains were cut to make blouson tops. \u201cWe\u2019re re-proposing deliberately to say, this is not a seasonal proposition, it is a brand proposition,\u201d said Symonds.

Those jewel-tone pieces were pretty, but the best looks were lace and body-skimming. A black dress with a lace mesh bodice and floral embroidery cascading down the torso really showed Shoji\u2019s craftsmanship, as did its V-shaped top and pant incarnation. Another standout was a modest long-sleeved embroidered black lace dress with an embedded corset.

Last season, in lieu of a by-the-book presentation, she invited everyone over to her apartment\u2014\u201ceveryone\u201d being editors, buyers, and influencers, but also women working outside of the fashion industry: activists, chefs, tech CEOs, entrepreneurs. Taylor felt rightly compelled to bring all of those worlds together and experience the real purpose of her clothes: to make women feel vibrant, feminine, and self-assured. Most designers like to talk about how their clothes relate to the broader culture or political climate, but it\u2019s rare to see that play out right in front of you. That first lunch was so pleasant, in fact, that Taylor repeated the concept today for Fall 2019. Her apartment was filled with inspiring women like Jenna Lyons; Polly Rodriguez, the founder and CEO of \u201csex tech\u201d company Unbound; Jocelyn Leavitt, cofounder of the coding app Hopscotch; and none other than Chelsea Clinton, to name just a few. Each was dressed in a printed charmeuse dress, fuzzy striped knit, or checked suit from the new collection, styled with their own shoes, jewelry, and accessories. Halima Aden wore Taylor\u2019s new zebra-print wrap dress with her own knit beanie, for instance; others took a tip from Taylor and mixed up clashing florals and plaids. Mixed prints are a Taylor trademark, seen in the hand-painted florals, blown-up plaids, Lurex dots, and zebra stripes in the lookbook. During a preview, she said Lauren Bacall was a big inspiration, pointing out a photo of the actress in a zebra turtleneck and black trousers on her moodboard. Taylor liked how that look wasn\u2019t delicate or \u201cgirly,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t masculine, either; her own zebra wide-leg trousers and \u201cS curve\u201d dresses nailed a similar balance.

Fall\u2019s charmeuse slip skirts and extra-long cardigans had a similar languid drape; it felt like a refreshing (and more grown-up) departure from her usual ruffles.

The smiles and comfortable conversation among her guests today was early proof of that."}, {"Designer": "Telfar", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "To say that the Telfar show at Irving Plaza was packed to the rafters would be an understatement; it was heaving. Designer Telfar Clemens has talked often of his affinity with musicians, and this season he took the fashion-show-as-concert format to its ultimate conclusion. For hundreds of excited fans who made it into the venue last night, there was no front row to be found, only a mosh pit. But let\u2019s back up a bit, to the moment Clemens conceived of his latest extravaganza. It turns out the idea was sparked not by a song but rather a piece of theater. \u201cI saw Slave Play last November and was totally blown away,\u201d said Clemens of Jeremy O. Harris\u2019s provocative Off-Broadway production. \u201cHe confronts all the difficult questions about race and the history of this country that we\u2019ve all been thinking about.\u201d The handsome 6-foot-5 actor and playwright played master of ceremonies last night, swaying over the audience in a cool blue corduroy suit and a Telfar ascot-tie shirt to give Alexander Hamilton a run for his money. He set the tone of the proceedings with a rousing, politically charged message. \u201cOur story is they, them, their,\u201d said Harris, swaying between the frayed edges of the enormous American flag that framed the stage. \u201cIn this sweet land of impunity, there is no California or New York, this land is your land. This is our country: Telfar Country.\u201d One by one, Telfar\u2019s \u201ccountry men\u201d came marching out into the spotlight, dressed in boot-cut pants and jackets with detachable button-off sleeves in a range of earthy \u201970s-inspired shades. After the chopped and screwed Budweiser logos of Spring, Clemens seemed to be moving his fascination with Americana deeper into Western territory. His popular high-waisted jeans were fastened with flashy Western-style belt buckles and spliced with vegan leather panels that gave the illusion of chaps. More subtle variations on the theme came through in the knits\u2014the fringed crewneck sweaters were a standout, as were the jersey dresses collaged with images of African-American cowboys. Oyinda, the beautiful British-Nigerian singer, looked particularly gorgeous, appearing on the scene for her performance dressed in leather pants and cowboy boots like she\u2019d just rode in on a horse. Country music is often touted as the soundtrack of a certain kind of American experience, one that tends to lean on conservative, right-wing values. Lest we forget, country singer Lee Greenwood was one of the few who agreed to perform at Trump\u2019s inauguration, belting out a rendition of \u201cGod Bless the USA.\u201d In that sense, the sight of a black woman in a ten-gallon hat and cowboy boots read like an act of resistance in the same way that Harris\u2019s performance was an elegant rebuke of the president\u2019s divisive State of the Union address. And that\u2019s not lost on Clemens. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve somehow come to zero in this country, but I still want to believe that good things can come from here,\u201d he said, \u201cand I want to represent that as an anchor American whose parents were not born here.\u201d Moments before the punk band Ho99o9 began to play the show\u2019s closing set, Clemens appeared on the stage, wearing the brand\u2019s new Black Lives Matter tee, for which all proceeds will go to the nonprofit organization. Instead of taking a bow, the designer turned and fell backward into the crowd, arms spread wide, crowd-surfing the wave of outstretched hands across the room. At a time when the ties that bind us as a nation are worn thin and the center cannot hold, this act of blind trust felt symbolic. With almost 15 years in the business, Telfar has weathered the storm where other young brands have failed, and that\u2019s largely thanks to the support of his community. Where others talk of building walls, Clemens is opening up the conversation around race, gender, and class. In that newly reclaimed safe space, a truly inclusive and forward-thinking identity for American fashion is taking shape."}, {"Designer": "Temperley London", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Shot on the dreamy Cornish estate that is Port Eliot, this Temperley London collection was loaded with looks for languid ladies of the manor to wear while surveying their fortunes.

But then, as now, it was hard to transition out of the start-up phase. A gray suit jacket naively embroidered with snippets of poetry circa Fall 2008 lingers in the memory for the way it mixed tradition with a wayward streak. Still, as charmed as New York was by the Hutsons, the Obedient Sons & Daughters label was short-lived. In the 10 years since Obedient\u2019s last collection, the Hutsons parted ways personally and professionally. Swaim worked behind the scenes at a number of New York brands, and he also created a popular Instagram account posting movie stills, art, interiors, poetry, and song lyrics that he dubbed The Academy New York.

He\u2019d announce his flash sales on Instagram, go to bed, and wake up with 50 orders. It was enough to keep him busy in his off hours, and to land a couple of Japanese retailers. Now, with streetwear on the wane, Hutson is getting back into the tailoring business; he\u2019s produced a capsule collection of pantsuits, camp shirts and pajama tops, and pleated trousers for Fall under The Academy New York name. \u201cIt was something I wanted to do this from the outset of this brand,\u201d Hutson says. \u201cI knew I was working back to doing this.\u201d There\u2019s a direct line connecting Obedient Sons & Daughters to The Academy. A 2019 white button-down scribbled with marker doodles is a descendant of that iconic embroidered 2008 suit jacket, and the general vibe is still Boy Scout-gone-just-a-little-bit-bad. Shown in monochrome, the camp shirt and pleated pants combination is an especially cool look. The modifications Hutson has made for the late 2010s include a looser suit-jacket fit and unisex sizing. \u201cThere is nothing I love more than getting my ideas out and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve really missed the most,\u201d he says of this career reboot. \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to just make clothes for clothes sake, there\u2019s enough of that already. I aspire to put clothes out that others will also want to wear for the next decade, or so.\u201d If that\u2019s an old school concept, he plans to execute it in a modern way: on Instagram\u2014where else?"}, {"Designer": "The Attico", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "For the past three years, Giorgia Tordini and Gilda Ambrosio have shown their collections in a series of sumptuous private Milanese residences. Each season, they would reveal to the jaded fashion throng a secret address\u2014and this is a city of well-concealed charms\u2014as well as some decadent hip-chick basics: silk embroidered kimonos, glimmer platforms, fringed and embroidered party frocks, velvet evening pouches. The intimacy of the spaces matched the boudoir sensibility of the clothes well. Today, in a small historic parking garage (yes, car parks can be historic in Italy) near Via Montenapoleone, that all changed. As Tordini says, \u201cThe Attico woman has finally left the apartment.\u201d The Attico woman, it would seem, now seeks refuge in a white, low-slung sports sedan from the late \u201970s or early \u201980s, possibly her mother\u2019s car, which her mother never drove after becoming a mom. The clothes also resemble what that same mom might have worn back then, in the throes of her wild-child, disco-heartbreaker youth: strong shoulders, poufed skirts, encrusted boleros, sassy jumpsuits, crushed-velvet leggings, silver jersey, and metallic leather and sparkle galore. As in every Attico collection, the colors are mostly vibrant (fuchsia, cerulean, emerald, garnet), and there are feathers for days (hanging off gloves, bags, and bodices). It\u2019s a lot of attitude and swagger, delivered with a wink and a slouch (in cozy cable-knits, vaguely piratical boots). There are only a few long dresses in the collection\u2014a sequined body skimmer in prismatic hues, a crystal-embroidered slip dress in sheer banana\u2014and they have a fragility to them that gently undercuts the shiny bluster of this new Attico gal, which is a nice thing. The most beautiful pieces are those that involve a white base that has been opulently embellished (hand-painted feathers on a silk chiffon chubby, for example). With this collection, Tordini and Ambrosio are themselves stepping out, much like their imagined client. They are now playing in the realm of other young talents who take inspiration from the exaggerated yet abbreviated silhouettes of the \u201980s: Anthony Vaccarello, the duo from Area, and Michael Halpern, to list only a few. It\u2019s a generational thing, and one inherently imbued with optimism. What makes the Attico designs work so well is that there is a lightness, in the best sense, to the whole notion of what these clothes should mean to the wearer. They are meant to be fun, pure, simple, and gorgeous, whether thrown on a love seat in a fabulous apartment or over the white leather interior of a vintage Alfa Romeo. Tordini and Ambrosio are creating a serious business with Attico, but it\u2019s one built on the sheer pleasure of dressing up . . . and, yes, getting out of the house."}, {"Designer": "The Elder Statesman", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "The Elder Statesman is on a journey, man. After collections that touched on self-realization, elevation, and \u201cthe road we\u2019re on,\u201d Greg Chait has landed in the moving waters of transformation and travel. It\u2019s really a continuation of Pre-Fall, with a lot of the Adam Shrewsbury artwork continuing throughout, these lucky 7s and flowers offering talismanic protection. Where The Elder Statesman really evolves season over season is in its thoughtful craftsmanship. New here is a fluffy shag, 50 percent silk, 50 percent cashmere, made into a rich blue tie-dye robe, and a custom woven patched into trousers in shades of red. A North Carolinian denim is washed in a signature tie-dye; a Technicolor dream coat is made by hand by a Central American collective. No stitch is unconsidered, and Chait could wax poetic about each knit and pearl over one, two, or three coffees yet. His proudest achievement, though, is just beginning. As he flipped through rails in his go-to New York haunt, the Bowery Hotel, his team was moving into a new studio in Los Angeles\u2019s Arts District.

The category isn\u2019t such a huge leap for them, considering their knit T-shirts, henleys, tank tops, and joggers feel so soft and lived-in you could easily wear them to bed. If you mixed it all together, in fact, distinguishing a \u201csleep shirt\u201d from a \u201cregular shirt\u201d would be anyone\u2019s guess, though the outcome doesn\u2019t really matter. Current and Elliott\u2019s greatest wish for each collection is that the pieces feel comfortable and pre-loved, all the better to look like a vintage find. They wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pair a pajama top with drop-crotch pants and regularly mix their \u201coff-duty\u201d sweatshirts with silk skirts and dresses. Speaking of dresses, there were a few new styles mixed in with all the jeans and knits, like a tiered and ruffled polka-dot cotton frock and a flowery silk number cinched with a rope. Both felt particularly feminine for The Great, which tends toward a more tomboyish vibe, though Current and Elliott styled both dresses with a beret and beat-up-looking boots\u2014their favorite kind of high-low contrast. The biggest news for Fall was the outerwear: a blush sherpa, a quilted liner jacket, and a more dramatic long checkered overcoat. Many of their customers are in California, but plenty of them live in (or at least travel to) cities with real winters. An XL puffer or a trendy faux fur would feel all wrong with The Great\u2019s peasant blouses and low-slung chinos, so those heavier coats will be a no-brainer when the temperatures dip again later this year."}, {"Designer": "The Row", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "So, what do you want from fashion right now? A scream or a whisper? That choice is shaping up to be the definition of the New York Fall 2019 shows, which have been either\u2014Britishism coming up here; apologies, folks\u2014all gong and no dinner (translation for this side of the pond: a whole lot of noise, but nothing in the way of sustenance) or, far rarer, a quiet treatise on the craft and techniques of making clothes that might feel relevant to today. (If you\u2019ve been following Vogue Runway the past few days, I am sure you can fill in the names on both sides of the divide yourself, but it\u2019s been heartening to see that the latter approach has been taken up by a few of the city\u2019s newer, younger, indie names.) That brings us to The Row, Mary-Kate and Ashley\u2019s ode to the kind of volume, noise or otherwise, that can be created by the quietude of their absolutely exquisite (and impeccably rendered) clothes. The Row isn\u2019t new, of course\u2014in fact, it\u2019s practically a major establishment these days, what with the continuing reordering-decimation-delete as applicable to New York City\u2019s fashion landscape\u2014but boy, do the Olsens know their way around orchestrating fabric, cut, and finish into a virtual symphony of sighs, something ably demonstrated by this terrific collection. Even the show\u2019s soundtrack, Castano\u2019s \u201cSpecta (Deepfunk Remix),\u201d couldn\u2019t obscure them. (Just as it has been impossible to ignore the influence The Row has been exerting across so many labels at so many different levels; these days, considered minimalism comes at every price point.) For the Olsens, fall starts and ends in the middle\u2014specifically, their new waist-focused silhouette, which threw into relief their continuing love of all-enveloping, blown-up volumes. Out came a series of coats and elongated jackets, mostly denuded of any detailing, which were gently inflated before nipping inward to the center then flaring out again, worn over diaphanous cowl-neck blouses and wide, tailored pants, which grazed the floor. Check out the standout version of this in curvaceous black, worn by Caroline Trentini, for further reference, though honorary shout-outs go to the strict gray coat over matching pants and another black coat-and-pants combo, this one etched with a gazillion black beads. At times, the look was accessorized with a substantial rubber-soled riding-Wellington boot hybrid, other times, a curious and weirdly chic little stocking slipper. Essentially a naked shoe, it certainly amplified the level of concealment offered by the clothes it was worn with. Plus, it served to underscore the strength to be had from walking softly and carrying a big coat next season."}, {"Designer": "Theory", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Francesco Fucci\u2019s task at Theory is to marry the classic and the current and to deliver it at the reasonable, below-designer-level prices that this 20-year-old company is built on. No one would ever call it the sexiest job in fashion, but Fucci, who has been in the role for about a year, brings to it a lot of heart. It all starts with his obsession with materials. Having a Neapolitan tailor for a great-uncle and spending several years at The Row instilled in him a great appreciation for the hand of a garment, and Theory\u2019s womenswear under Fucci\u2019s direction feels significantly richer than it did in its earlier iterations. For fall, one of his most compelling fabrics is a substantial moleskin in vibrant red that he cut into a generously proportioned parka and a lean pantsuit tailored along 1970s lines. The moleskin feels almost like velvet, but retains a sturdiness that gives it an everyday attitude. He used a lighter-weight workwear blue moleskin for a boxy button-down shirt and cropped skinny pants. All of the moleskin pieces are likely to become more interesting with wear and age. At the opposite, more polished end of the Fucci spectrum is silk crepe and tweed. The silk crepe he cut into a long, asymmetric neck dress worn over trousers, and the tweed he used for midi-skirts and a slightly a-line, sleeveless sheath. The Theory shopper is likely to be surprised by both materials and tempted by the tweed, a more substantial, versatile kind of fabric. User-friendliness is essential to Theory\u2019s DNA. This being a fall collection, Fucci showed a range of outerwear, from that moleskin parka to a double-face wool in traditional camel. The trapeze coat with a removable shearling collar seems most representative of his ethos: practical with a side of romance."}, {"Designer": "Thom Browne", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "No one loves a fashion fantasy more than Thom Browne. Guessing where his imagination will go next is part of the thrill of the show. Still, his brand has been built on a down-to-business aesthetic, one that begins and ends with a gray flannel suit. At Browne\u2019s Fall show this afternoon, the first troop of models was clearly on the clock, each one marching towards a desk that was furnished with an old typewriter and a chic mid-century modern lamp. After last season\u2019s death-trap heels, the click-clack of sensible brogues against the wooden floor was a reassuring sound. Browne ditched his curious fetish for masks, too. Instead, his women had monocles and spectacles suspended in front of their eyes, all the better to see the runway and the world. On that sure footing, Browne proposed three distinct uniforms for Fall. The first, his signature: an ankle-nipped pantsuit; the second, a bourgeois pleated skirtsuit; the third a midi-length sheath cut loose through the body. Browne tends to twist all notions of perceived reality in his clothes, and trompe l\u2019oeil motifs gave the illusion of layered tailoring. There were some highly intricate applications of the idea, including one dress that appeared like a pointillist reimagining of a suit. Look close enough and you could trace the minuscule pearls that studded the outline of a tie, a shirt, and the three-piece skirtsuit. It was tough to pick standouts, given the couture-like trimmings that were applied to virtually every piece. One look appeared like a smorgasbord of textured red, white, and blue tweeds, for example. Several portraits of Lady Una Troubridge by Romaine Brooks, the 1920s French artist who was known for her grayscale paintings of women in androgynous clothing, were writ large in the collection. In the case of one cropped tuxedo suit, Brooks\u2019s portrait was even bigger than life-size. Ultimately though, Browne was referencing his own canon, specifically his first menswear show at Pitti 10 years ago. This time around there were no elaborate flights of fancy, just Thom Browne at his most exquisite and essential. His female fans won\u2019t have much trouble putting that fashion notion to work."}, {"Designer": "Threeasfour", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "In the preface to his essay collection Ghosts of my Life, British theorist Mark Fisher writes of \u201cthe cancellation of the future,\u201d as in, the creeping sense that we\u2019re stuck in a sociocultural loop, and nothing will ever truly be new again. All the ideas are recycled. There\u2019s a similar anxiety at work in the excellent new Netflix series Russian Doll: Nadia, the character played by Natasha Lyonne, is forced to relive the same night again and again and again, like a player stuck in a video game\u2019s locked room, searching for the hidden weapon that will let her fight her way to the next level. Both Fisher\u2019s work and Russian Doll came to mind watching tonight\u2019s remarkable Threeasfour show, because it was a curious thing to see this explicitly avant-garde brand playing with the concept of recapitulation. Not only were designers Gabi, Ange, and Adi using, as the show notes put it, \u201crejected paintings from artist Stanley Casselman as \u2018fabric,\u2019\u201d but they were also borrowing patterns from their 1999 debut collection. Back then, twenty years ago, they were known as As Four, and their designs did have the shock of the new. Seeing the collective revisit and remix, it made you wonder why the fashion future they seemed to predict never really came to pass, and whether their old tricks still may hold the key to exiting the fashion loop. The standard metrics applied to fashion shows don\u2019t work for Threeasfour. With most other brands, it suffices to say something like, \u201cThe crepe de chine prints were nice; the ruffles were a little fussy.\u201d Basically you\u2019re talking in terms of the known reality of clothes and how women wear them, and what they might reasonably be expected to embrace. This collection requires an adjustment. You might look at a dress that conjured a vision of planets sucked into a super-sun\u2019s vortex, like a reverse big bang, and think, Impractical! But the thing to do is to ask yourself whether that dress is any more or less impractical than a red carpet gown with complicated corsetry and several pounds of crystal embellishment. It\u2019s not like Gabi, Ange, and Adi are proposing their dress\u2014handworked and elaborate as it was\u2014as a form of utilitarian daywear. And once you give yourself over to thinking about these gorgeous, inventively crafted clothes as stuff for special occasions, you get the odd thrill of reveling in the possibility that a future could exist where actors and actresses turn up at the Oscars looking like serpent-human hybrids or living, breathing Abstract Expressionism paintings. Why not? That\u2019s the secret weapon that gets you out of the locked room and advances you to the next level\u2014asking yourself, in all seriousness, why things can\u2019t be other than as they currently are. Threeasfour has been posing that question for two decades. It\u2019s our turn to supply an answer."}, {"Designer": "Tibi", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Curiosity was the buzzword at Tibi today. Guests may not have realized the large-scale, multicolored sculptures dotting the set were loosely inspired by a children\u2019s playground; designer Amy Smilovic said she wanted them to mirror the sense of discovery she\u2019d built into the clothes. Most of her Fall pieces looked relatively simple from afar, but came with small, special tweaks: a bit of ruching on a tawny cashmere coat, for instance; a rubberized belt cinching a wool blazer; a three-color trench with a trompe l\u2019oeil, pieced-together effect; an oversize cable knit that revealed a completely open back as the model glided by. Other surprises required a closer look, or wouldn\u2019t even reveal themselves until you\u2019d spend some time with the garment: A black overcoat had \u201cstaples\u201d on the lapel for a touch of shine, but it was also one of Smilovic\u2019s first experiments with recycled materials. The wool was made from entirely repurposed fibers; she said it was the first \u201ceco\u201d wool she\u2019d found that still felt luxurious. The glossy PVC trousers she paired it with may not be as earth-friendly, but they\u2019re at least something you\u2019d keep in your closet for a long time. Smilovic is a big believer in holding onto your clothes and has little patience for disposable trends; on Instagram, she often snaps photos of herself re-wearing Tibi pieces from her early collections as well as runway prototypes that never got produced. \u201cRemember to shop your closet\u201d is her recurring motto. Designing clothes the Tibi customer will keep forever and cherish is easier said than done, of course; Smilovic relies on rich materials, unexpected colors (like muted teal, kelly green, chartreuse, and brown) and clever details to get it done. In terms of silhouette, she\u2019s also pushing her customer to try a few completely new ones: There were blazers over ultra-miniskirts, as well as long-over-long sweaters and pencil skirts. \u201cThere\u2019s something lady about that, which is a word we never would have used in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in these strange colors, it doesn\u2019t feel so literal.\u201d Backstage before the show, Smilovic also spoke about designing into a \u201chigh low\u201d mix. \u201cIt used to be that you were expected to buy your \u2018high\u2019 pieces one place, and your \u2018low\u2019 somewhere else,\u201d she said. \u201cBut why can\u2019t you have both in the same collection?\u201d Retailers tend to ask designers to hem themselves into a specific price range, but Smilovic isn\u2019t convinced. She\u2019ll put a lofty, four-figure cashmere coat next to a competitively priced hoodie and a louche sequined dress\u2014and Tibi fans likely have a reason to buy all three. Having the flexibility to make \u00fcber-luxe pieces and remarkably easy ones naturally creates a bit more room for creativity. That translated to Smilovic\u2019s men\u2019s collection, too: Guys wore a mix of relaxed jeans, ribbed knits, leather trousers, shearling flip-flops, and chunky sneakers. Perhaps the high-low, something-for-every-occasion idea originated in menswear; consider how brands like Louis Vuitton and Gucci have been blending their most high-end men\u2019s pieces with casual, streetwise ones. It makes sense, in terms of attracting a seriously loyal customer; if you can get your daywear and investment pieces all in one place, why waste your time looking elsewhere?"}, {"Designer": "Tod\u2019s", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Irina Shayk was resplendently sitting front row at Tod\u2019s show this morning. Sporting a belted brown leather jacket, dark pants, and flat suede loafers, she was the epitome of radiant, classic cool. \u201cWhat I love about Tod\u2019s is that it\u2019s timeless and all about quality,\u201d said the savvy-sounding supermodel.

I\u2019m not keen on spending on passing trends.\u201d You didn\u2019t need to be Russian to appreciate the straightforward appeal of the collection, rich in strong outerwear pieces that would comfortably sit in any modern wardrobe. This being Tod\u2019s, leather obviously had the lion\u2019s share here: Fitted glove-leather blazers in a caramel color were worn with pencil or pleated skirts; short, featherlight trapeze-cut nappa leather dresses were softly draped at the neck. Boxy T-shirts in nude colors topped wide-leg drawstring pants in malleable tan leather, while knee-length Bermudas added a touch of boyish ease to practical urban looks. It goes without saying that it all exuded the high-end Italian flair for well-crafted daywear staples\u2014but nothing less was expected of Tod\u2019s. Besides the variety of bucket bags and new versions of the ladylike D-Styling bag proposed in every possible size and color (and accessorizing almost every look), what stood out in the collection was the moving-away-from-the-leather offer. It came via a svelte, modern take on masculine-inspired voluminous city coats and belted trenchcoats in Prince of Wales, houndstooth, or checkered wools. The leopard-printed fitted version would look glamorous enough to tempt even the discerning Shayk. On a more classic-not-classic note, an oversize navy wool peacoat had the back quilted, piumino-like, in black varnished leather; it was just the tweak needed to make the look feel updated and fresh."}, {"Designer": "Toga", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Brevity best sums up Toga founder Yasuko Furuta\u2019s way with words: The show\u2019s typically ambiguous title\u2014\u201cSightline, Cutline, Align\u201d\u2014served as the only explanation of the Fall collection presented today. Perhaps the Japanese designer feels that the stories are all there to be seen in the clothes\u2014and in a way she\u2019s right. Certainly there were some enchanting details to be found in this procession of artfully tweaked tailoring. The outerwear was a highlight: Beautiful oversize blue overcoats strung with crescent-moon-shape brooches; black bikers that were deconstructed, folded and cinched; and white faux leather bonded jackets with seams a whisper of feathers. This plumage was mirrored, too, in a boldly striped coat and a line of ethereal circular bags. It was the accessories that really reigned throughout this offering, constantly luring the eye to the extent that at times they threatened to engulf entire looks. Take the pointy-toed, coated enamel waders that came in varying hues and dimensions\u2014from bulbous black knee-highs to lilac salopettes\u2014that made a squelchy sound as models walked, as though they\u2019d been dragged from the ocean\u2019s depths. Or the cascades of circular jewels and beads, on earrings and lapels, that occasionally served as cuffs on crisp white shirting, adding interest to the utilitarian styling. Judging by the sporty neoprene hoods and gloves on display here, Furuta was in a protective mood this season. But however expressive the designs, one can\u2019t help but yearn for a little more elucidation and narrative. Toga has a deservedly loyal following in London, and surely they, too, would like to delve deeper into the workings of the mind behind these creations."}, {"Designer": "Tom Ford", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Tom Ford has gone tame. Well, that\u2019s not quite how he\u2019d put it. The master of fabulous excess and full-tilt glamour is opting for simplicity. Postshow, he called it a \u201csearch for security\u201d and said it was a response to the culture of negativity in the world around us, especially in the United States. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been a designer who\u2019s talked about a moment in time, how that\u2019s influenced what I design, but you can\u2019t escape the news,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI feel frustrated and agitated and exhausted. And I don\u2019t want to wear anything particularly challenging or anything particularly aggressive.\u201d Translated on the runway, this wasn\u2019t quite the fashion equivalent of unplugging and going off the grid, but it was certainly a more understated outing than his collection of a year ago, the centerpiece of which was a crystal-studded Tom Ford of Beverly Hills black sweatshirt. Ford\u2019s desire for calm and security led him to tailoring. It\u2019s his wheelhouse; you can recognize a Tom Ford men\u2019s suit from across the room. The women\u2019s suits on tonight\u2019s runway were noteworthy for their luscious color, with nods to Yves Saint Laurent in Mariacarla Boscono\u2019s red, pink, and purple combination, and to Ford\u2019s own iconic velvet tux for Gucci in Gigi Hadid\u2019s red-on-red. Shoulders were strong, collars were turned up, and waists were snug. Models tucked hands into trouser pockets to accentuate the narrowness above. As for those trousers, they were without exception oversize, yet crisp in satin, with gentle rolled cuffs above the ankle. Underneath, Ford layered snug knits or hooded sweatshirts instead of button-downs. It doesn\u2019t get more real-world than hoodies. He didn\u2019t give up the glamour cold turkey, though. The ankle-strap peep-toe platform pumps strewn with rhinestones were a saucy riposte to the restraint elsewhere. And there were faux-fur fedoras and faux jackets and coats of many shapes and sizes, including a gleaming silver chubby. The silk jersey evening columns with heavy chain embellishments echoed the slinky white numbers from the same mid-\u201990s collection that produced that fabulous red tux. Designers\u2019 constant dilemma is the push and pull of the new and the dependable. In this time of chaos it makes sense that Ford would reexamine what he\u2019s good at. (There\u2019s plenty of evidence that the formula is working elsewhere\u2014see Prada and Versace.) He hasn\u2019t gone tame, per se, as much as he\u2019s reworking the sleek \u201990s codes he famously established. It\u2019s hard to synthesize the zeitgeist twice, but certainly, that red velvet is going to be irresistible all over again."}, {"Designer": "TommyNow", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "It\u2019s showtime at the Apollo! For the second season of their design collaboration, Tommy Hilfiger and Zendaya took the audience uptown to the landmark Harlem music hall. A venue that has been home to vaudeville performances, jazz, hip-hop, and more, the Apollo holds a special significance for the African American community. Though segregated and whites-only in its early years, it has long been a benchmark for black artistry. It\u2019s something Zendaya wanted to acknowledge: \u201cIt\u2019s a place that has such history and soul, it\u2019s a dream location,\u201d she said backstage. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted just to come here, and we wanted to pay homage to the people who paved the way for me to even be here in this space.\u201d After last season\u2019s unabashed celebration of black womanhood, Zendaya and Hilfiger wanted to keep the momentum going. The late \u201970s and early \u201980s remained the key references, but they changed tack on the time of day. Where Spring was filled with disco references and sparkle, Fall\u2019s offerings skewed toward daytime. Modernized versions of the leisure suit, wide-leg pants, and Carter-era wardrobe staples featured prominently. Pam Grier\u2019s blaxploitation wardrobe of leather pants, long scarves, and d\u00e9colletage-baring shirts served as an inspiration, but so did forces closer to home. \u201cMy grandmother has a lot of these clothes. Many of the looks were taken directly from her life,\u201d said Zendaya. \u201cI\u2019m looking to the effortless chic of that time period; this is my fantasy of that era.\u201d Hilfiger was clearly in his element revisiting a decade he\u2019s intimately familiar with. After all, his fashion career began in \u201971 when he started his first store, planting the seeds for what would eventually become a billion-dollar brand. Zendaya\u2019s perspective on the period is viewed through a Gen-Z lens, but Hilfiger lived through it all. \u201cWhen Zendaya said she wanted to do the \u201970s I had chills, because that\u2019s my era,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the shapes, I know the fabrics, and I know the look so well, but we\u2019ve modernized it and made it relevant for right now.\u201d The revisions were most evident in the menswear\u2014Alton Mason danced across the runway in a python suit fit for a modern dandy\u2014and the eclecticism Law Roach worked into the styling. A silent partner within the collaboration, his outr\u00e9 perspective was all over the collection. Of course, a Tommy show isn\u2019t just about clothing. If last season Zendaya claimed her seat at the table, this time around she delivered unapologetic black joy. More than a home to music and comedy performances, the Apollo is known for its ultracompetitive amateur nights complete with audience participation. The Tommy experience channeled some of that energy but got creative with the presentation. Instead of hosting the main event in the theater, the brand took the show outside with a set of Harlem brownstones that gave the appearance of an ultrachic city block complete with classic cars parked in the driveways. With singers crooning along to a soundtrack of cookout classics and models dancing as they strode through the space, it was a joyous celebration, one Hilfiger credits his multitasking muse with creating. \u201cShe came in with the vision,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy, I just listened to what she wanted to do, and then we did it.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Tomo Koizumi", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cIs that the show for the giant dresses?\u201d was the question heard around the fashion world this week. Tomo Koizumi is the designer, and, yes, the dresses are huge. But to write off Koizumi as a confectioner is shortsighted. Up at Marc Jacobs\u2019s Madison Avenue store, where Koizumi held a first fashion show, put on with the help of Katie Grand, Guido Palau, Pat McGrath, Jin Soon, Tabitha Simmons, Anita Bitton, and a cast of A-list models, the Japanese designer proved his mettle. Grand had orchestrated the whole affair, having discovered Koizumi on Instagram through her friend Giles Deacon. Koizumi arrived stateside just five days ago\u2014only his second time in New York\u2014with three boxes of garments, some new, others from his archive. He set up shop at Marc Jacobs\u2019s studio in Soho, where his florescent polyester organza pieces were being revived from their journey halfway around the world. In a preview, Koizumi explained his complex inspirations that range from Capucci to Leigh Bowery to hanawa, a Japanese funerary banner with plastic floral designs. He\u2019s also very fond of Sailor Moon and the idea that a woman can be at once cute and strong. His pieces are geometrically constructed; a sleeve can be a circle or a skirt a rectangle, none more arresting than the azure disk with arm and leg holes that transforms its wearer into a blue moon. He describes his ruffles as a type of armor; unsurprisingly he has found success dressing pop stars and actresses in his native country. What role will Koizumi serve in the ready-to-wear and retail-minded American fashion scene? In the basement of the Marc Jacobs store he created a Wonderland worthy of Alice herself, where social roles were upended (even V.V.V.V.I.P. guests stood), proportions were skewed and slanted, and viewers were guided through this dreamlike narrative by white rabbits as compelling as Karen Elson, Joan Smalls, and Gwendoline Christie. The fantasy, for a moment, was reality. American fashion needs that, too. As if he knew what the people who bemoaned going all the way up to 60th Street for the \u201cgiant dresses\u201d would say, Koizumi also embellished some of the collaborative tees Jacobs made with Hey Reilly in 2018. Lady Liberty smiled on the front, while the sleeves were swallowed by cloud-like ombr\u00e9 ruffles.

It\u2019s remembered for its experimental approach to learning and an emphasis on the arts. The likes of Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg, and Josef and Anni Albers passed through its doors, and Buckminster Fuller built his famous geodesic dome on its campus. In 20 years of show-going, the school has never once come up in a backstage interview, which makes Tory Burch\u2019s mention of it today all the more noteworthy. \u201cI\u2019ve always been obsessed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really formed the trajectory of modern art in America. But what I loved about it was its progressive attitude. It wasn\u2019t about gender or race. It was about sheer creativity and the confluence of all these different artists coming together. It\u2019s where modern thinking should be today.\u201d Burch interpreted her theme loosely, and the collection\u2019s eclecticism was its virtue. Floral-print dresses, which have become such an important category for the label\u2014we lost count of how many Fall 2018 flower-print frocks we saw in the crowd\u2014were well represented on the runway in midi and maxi lengths. One particularly exuberant number was pleated and patch-worked from multiple prints, then topped with a long down puffer lined in one of the dress\u2019s florals. It was an unusual combination, which means it\u2019s likely to resonate. Side by side with that exuberance, Burch showed streamlined double-breasted wool coats with brushed-gold toggle hardware and single-breasted styles with fastenings that vaguely evoked Fuller\u2019s geodesic designs. A plaid trench with tan leather piping and buttons got lots of nods of approval. On the accessories front, the patchwork leather knee-high boots with gold heels, which Burch showed with a pantsuit and with a fluid pleated dress, are easy contenders for footwear of the week."}, {"Designer": "Tory Sport", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Streetwear and athleisure are in retreat on the runways, with designers pushing a more polished, pulled-together approach to dressing.

It made for a heady spin through the racks, but beyond the colors themselves, there was no obvious link to the Rajneeshpuram\u2019s Antelope, Oregon, compound.

Far removed from the bustle of her Los Angeles base, Napa\u2019s vineyards offered Turk a starting point, informing both the collection\u2019s color palette and its sense of ease. As always, vintage shapes Turk\u2019s worldview, but after Spring\u2019s jaunt aboard a swinging \u201960s yacht, she seemed content to curl up with a nice glass of sauvignon blanc and enjoy the relaxed take on dressing of the late \u201970s. Gone were the crop tops and splashy jumpsuits, in their place: cozy sweaters, faux fur, and plenty of plaids combined for comparatively subdued daywear. Wine tones and shades of navy may have taken center stage, but Turk can always be counted on for a vivid print. Fall\u2019s incarnation featured hand-drawn birds and paisley in the vein of Sarah Campbell, creator of Liberty of London\u2019s iconic \u201970s designs. A statement pattern offered in blue and red variants for men and women, respectively, was an appealing example of the kind of joyous fashion Turk is known for. Butterfly-covered sundresses and punchy chevron slips will bring a smile to the face of wearers. Turk remains consistently upbeat, skipping some of the decade\u2019s grittier trends and wine country\u2019s bacchanalian side. The revelry may have been pared-back, but there were plenty of new ideas. Basketball shorts were given the silk treatment for a chill alternative to a knee-length skirt, while the leisure suit was revamped in dark denim with contrast stitching.

Unlike other labels that bounce from reference to reference, Michelle Robinson and her team prefer to see spring, pre-fall, and fall as three chapters in a story, not separate entities. In September, they kicked off their visual journey in India with braided and knotted garments inspired by men\u2019s clothing in Gujarat. Pre-fall explored the dressing traditions of the Rabari women, and fall pivoted to traditional Indian interiors. The raised, circular decoration on mud houses, known as Lippan Kaam, was translated to swirling jacquards and ribbed knits with embroidery around the bust while featherweight cashmere turtlenecks were inlaid with tiny mirrors, a riff on the ones you see in Indian homes and textiles (they\u2019re meant to repel the negative effects of the evil eye). The mirrors inspired the surprisingly bold reflective silver and metallic copper skirts, too, while other knits were trimmed with delicate silver beads and strips of Lurex to mimic jewelry. Elsewhere, the references were less literal: A chunky brushed-cashmere sweater and a drapey trench came in a rich marigold, which some TSE customers will know symbolizes good luck in parts of India. Others will simply register it as a fresh, of-the-moment color\u2014ditto the lime green. Even the woman who lives in TSE\u2019s camel trousers and double-face coats needs a pop of color here and there, preferably one that\u2019s striking and unexpected. The chunky lime turtleneck would be a good place to start, but the sleek, curve-skimming turtleneck dress\u2014which was cut in a fine-gauge knit at the top then cascaded into liquid silk\u2014had the makings of a no-fuss, high-impact cocktail look."}, {"Designer": "Tsumori Chisato", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Tsumori Chisato would have preferred to shoot some of these latest looks out on the streets of Paris, but she missed the atypically spring-like weather that brought trees into early bloom by a mere day. So against painterly Plan B backdrops, her Fall collection once again put forth the French tropes from last season\u2014only now, a little less literally. You can still make out her abstracted Eiffel Tower and the Tsu-Marie Antoinette as illustrated accents; her modified tricolor has returned as well. New here are the French expressions that appear rather poetically in the clouds, Paris rooftops below. And of course, what would a French collection be without connecting back to l\u2019amour, which appears on an openwork jersey top. But what makes this collection so delightful is how Chisato infused Japanese fabrics with distinct Parisian flare\u2014whether a feathery jacquard that she flipped upside down for extra texture, a delicate crinkled crepe that contours the body better than pleating, or scalloped lace embedded with her initials. Furthermore, she played around with silhouettes, shifting the emphasis on her usual A-lines and balloon shapes to ladylike elongated lines and a few boyish ensembles. If her whimsy speaks to you, in other words, this collection is full of wearable looks. As for the mini upside-down logo T-shirt tacked onto a jersey dress, Chisato decided to revive this design\u2014one of her earliest\u2014after an admirer brought up the idea. It reads like a cool foil to all her lively artwork. In fact, when it was suggested that she should make a book\u2014not just clothes\u2014out of her travel illustrations, she hinted that this idea has also been on her mind. \u201cI hope,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe soon.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Ulla Johnson", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Ulla Johnson makes gorgeous dresses; this we\u2019ve established. But the big surprises in today\u2019s show were the coats, starting with the first look: a plush, oversize, reversible chocolate brown shearling with hand-crocheted orange stitching. Shearling coats are a dime a dozen these days, but none of them look quite like Johnson\u2019s. That mostly comes down to the handwork: \u201cI have this feeling about handmade garments and the emotional weight they carry,\u201d she said backstage. \u201cI care about my garments being long-lasting, and I think the process [of how they\u2019re made] is such a big part of that.\u201d Johnson\u2019s clothes have a richness and refinement that belie the \u201ccrafty\u201d vibe you might expect from such artisanal processes. The sapphire silk dress with sequined ribbons of gold was, in fact, hand-loomed in India; the striped alpaca sweaters were hand-knit in Peru. That Johnson has become a resource for both categories\u2014evening dresses and comfy daywear\u2014speaks to her intuitive abilities as a woman designing for other women. Why wouldn\u2019t you buy a devor\u00e9 velvet gown from the same designer you rely on for your favorite jeans and sweaters? \u201cI think all of us are all of these women,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have this narrow vision of ourselves.\u201d She pointed out the luminous gold velvet tiered gown and the knit-and-trousers look that followed it: \u201cThey still speak to each other.\u201d Maybe the first look is what you wish you could wear every day, and the second is what you actually wear\u2014fantasy versus reality!\u2014but they\u2019re in the same world. Speaking of fantasy\u2014Johnson imbues just a touch of it in every piece, which is another reason she\u2019s found such a devoted clientele. \u201cI think fashion has gone so far afield from fantasy, and it makes me sad,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about creating products\u2014it\u2019s about making something that makes women feel beautiful and powerful, so for me it\u2019s always about creating a sense of joy and optimism and exuberance.\u201d The prints and textures felt particularly upbeat and lush this season, from the blown-up marigold blooms to a \u201cgilded\u201d evening skirt and an acid green floral cloque she developed to look vaguely like leopard. There were zebra ikat jeans and knee-high spotted calf boots, too; it\u2019s only the first day of New York Fashion Week, but animal prints are already a big trend. Perhaps it\u2019s because they make a statement but never really \u201cgo out of style,\u201d or maybe it all goes back to our desire to connect with the natural world. Johnson might agree with that sentiment; there was something warm and vaguely tribal about her spots and stripes, especially mixed with feathered earrings (by the talented Sonia Boyajian), clunky wooden cuffs, and Johnson\u2019s own resin tasseled handbags and resin baskets."}, {"Designer": "Undercover", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Undercover\u2019s Jun Takahashi has a thing for horror movies. At his men\u2019s show in January, he lifted images from A Clockwork Orange, and a few seasons before that he sent his models out in twos, conjuring images of The Shining\u2019s famous Grady twins, all the way down to the fringes of blood-red crystals decorating a light blue baby doll dress. Luca Guadagnino\u2019s Suspiria is Takahashi\u2019s latest fixation. He\u2019s such a fan of the film, which centers around a dance company-slash-witch-coven in 1970s West Berlin, and is as beautiful as it is terrifying, that he approached the director about using stills from the movie and its poster design for his new women\u2019s collection. Guadagnino, who is very receptive to the fashion world (he\u2019s currently collaborating on a short film with Valentino\u2019s Pierpaolo Piccioli, starring Julianne Moore and Kyle MacLachlan), said yes. And so a photo of Tilda Swinton, the movie\u2019s dance company director, appears on a shirtdress whose full sleeves echo the robe the actress wears in the image; Mia Goth, one of the young dancers, is featured on a blouson hoodie; and one of the terrifying hooks that the company matrons use to drag a meddling dancer off the screen plays a starring role on a bomber jacket and on the ball skirt of a long dress. Striking, but sort of sadistic stuff. \u201cPeople have two sides,\u201d Takahashi said at that twins show. For those less in touch with their dark parts, he did inventive tailoring. A pantsuit might be wool in front and cable-knit in back, and come with two interchangeable lapels, to create different looks. And a corduroy \u201cjean jacket\u201d will have un-matching knit sleeves. The freestanding blouson puffer sleeves, shown in red or in an S-print inspired by the Suspiria movie title, are a useful idea: a lot of attitude for not a lot of commitment. The movie references will eventually run their course, so it was satisfying to see some of the signature Takahashi clever thinking on these pieces."}, {"Designer": "Unravel", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Ben Taverniti\u2019s latest Unravel collection owes a lot to the Chitoses and Junyas of the fashion world with its hybridized garments married together from across the fashion spectrum.

Still, Taverniti\u2019s approach to building Unravel as a network and not a string of nodes is admirable. Before, his brand was just denim or just sport, or just stretchy things that look good in a selfie. He wants to make tailoring and true ready-to-wear, coloring in the functional around his flashy clothing. His newest ideas are around suiting and outerwear, sending out plaid trousers with denim backs, blazers with curvilinear wire propping up the lapels into a squiggle, and the aforementioned multi-coats in every grungy combination. Against a set of blown-up snapshots of this season\u2019s materials, he\u2019s sent out something for every type of dishabille woman, from hoodie to PVC corset. The strongest pieces are the simplest: flare leather trousers cut within a hair of obscene, a red jersey dress snugging and hugging curves.

Piccioli is a magnetic, down-to-earth guy who cares about celebrating the skilled people who work for him, a man on an intuitive mission to place fashion on a positive plane. \u201cI feel that people are looking for emotion and dreams\u2014but not distant dreams,\u201d he said today before his ready-to-wear show was about to take to the runway. \u201cI want to create a community for Valentino. I mean something different from \u2018lifestyle,\u2019 which is about owning objects. It\u2019s about people who share values.\u201d In prepping this show, he\u2019d reached out laterally in two directions to connect with cocreators from beyond the exclusive realms of the Roman house. One was the continuation of the creative brainstorming with Jun Takahashi of Undercover that the pair started with Valentino\u2019s menswear. This time they morphed together a print of a 19th-century neoclassical sculpture of kissing lovers with a pop-punkish image of roses. The prints proliferated over coats and dresses, settling most beautifully as a cut-out pink bloom appliqu\u00e9d on white lace in the breast of a slim cream midi dress. Piccioli had also been hit by the resonances of the direct action Movement for the Emancipation of Poetry, which anonymously pastes lyrical lines on walls in cities around the world. The idea of publicly accessible poetry about love and tenderness led him to commission the Scottish poet and artist Robert Montgomery and the three young writers (Greta Bellamacina, Mustafa The Poet, and Yrsa Daley-Ward) to contribute to a slim volume, Valentino on Love, which was left on seats for the audience to pick up. An illuminated billboard with lines by Montgomery stood at the end of the runway, reading, \u201cThe people you love become ghosts inside of you and like this you keep them alive.\u201d Piccioli showed how he\u2019d picked lines from the anthology to be printed or embroidered inside coats, on mid-layers of tulle dresses, inside bags and boots\u2014so that only the wearer would know they are there. In between all these gestures consciously intended to include a much younger customer\u2014there was a series of leggy tunics and short coats\u2014came the timeless, drop-dead-simple side of Valentino. The beauty of the cut and balance of a red A-line silk dress with an integral scarf flung diagonally across it, or a deep purple floor-length gown with fluted panels visible only in movement\u2014these are the fashion poetics that Piccioli and his team make near impossible to translate into words but whose appeal will speak beyond seasons and down generations."}, {"Designer": "Vanessa Bruno", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "How did Vanessa Bruno land on Georgia O\u2019Keeffe as the inspiration for this collection? \u201cShe was a free woman, a strong woman\u2014and she was completely timeless,\u201d said the designer from her Paris showroom. As 2019 marks the 20th anniversary of Vanessa Bruno, it\u2019s fair to say the brand perseveres based on those same values. Bruno hasn\u2019t been on the official Paris Fashion Week schedule for some years, yet she has maintained a put-together, relatable approach that women continue to appreciate. \u201cI feel good because I feel confident in what I do,\u201d she said of reaching the milestone. By channeling O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s life in New Mexico, this lineup ended up more thematic than usual. A gaucho via Rive Gauche vibe gave distinct personality to several looks (see: the ponchos, high-waisted pants, knee-high boots, rounded-crown felt hats, and a generally earthy palette). Prints and embroideries found on folksy dresses and winter coats alike were reworked from traditional Native American motifs. \u201cI\u2019ve always sought out authenticity,\u201d said Bruno, when asked about those pieces. \u201cAnd there has always been an Arts and Crafts aspect to my designs.\u201d That being the case, multicolored sweaters were handwoven (albeit in Italy), as were straps on a deluxe version of Bruno\u2019s signature cabas tote bag, quite attractive in gradient wool felt. But for all the new textural fabrics, streamlined Victorian looks arrived back in the Bruno vernacular. Which is to say, if you\u2019re not feeling this season\u2019s O\u2019Keeffe-isms, lace-paneled looks and a bias-cut dress in brick red would be worth considering.

The oddball models are still loping out, heads lolling like hipsters possessed, but the collection was elevated. Taubensee made a cameo in a starched button-down with built-in bra detailing that would\u2019ve passed on establishment runways, and there were more striped shirts where that came from. Their tailoring, too, has evolved. See the cropped denim blazer, denim trouser skirt, and Peter Pan collar worn by Leah Hennessey, a performer currently costarring in Slash at MX Gallery.

Today, she was in her showroom, presenting a collection with its roots in Celtic tradition. She said she was attracted to the culture\u2019s fierce warrior women. Wang may be best known for bridal, but she\u2019s lately emphasized tailoring in her ready-to-wear, which has lent it a tough streak amid the romance. Originally, it was an interest in plaids that led Wang in the direction of the Celts. Her research led her to their sash-like tonnag garment; it gave her plenty of opportunities to experiment with the draping that\u2019s central to her own aesthetic. Wool doesn\u2019t naturally lend itself to draping; it\u2019s typically stiff and bulky. But Wang used those qualities to her advantage, creating asymmetrical volumes that she layered over everything from a wisp of a gold-paillette slip dress to a tailored jacket. \u201cIt\u2019s the new scarf for me,\u201d she said. The sturdy wool would probably prove useful in inclement weather, but it\u2019s the tonnag\u2019s swagger that makes it interesting. (Alexander McQueen understood this well.) The Celts provided Wang with other design elements too. Among them, the manuscript-print dress in body-hugging silk jersey was more persuasive than the Celtic words for loyalty, bravery, and constancy that were embroidered on pants and sleeves. As for romance, Wang tapped into those decades of experience in bridal to create a delicate, white-lace apron dress, the vibe of which she described, in her quotable way, as \u201cpriestess druid.\u201d But her best idea, in the end, had little to do with the inspirational Celts.

That said, anyone familiar with her designs knows well that her interpretation is sui generis\u2014less rigid, more offbeat and arty. For Fall, she played up the art aspect directly with an Impressionist-inspired landscape that stretched across tops and wrapped around pants. It\u2019s difficult to make out in photos and earthier in tone than the palette of Van Gogh or Gauguin, say; but printed on windbreaker material that Leroy had shaped with adjustable volume, it became intriguingly expressive. Elsewhere, fabrics spoke to her exacting eye and hand, from Harris tweed, shaggy faux fur, textured knits, and fluid jersey. Long, spread collars and loose pants were countered with rounded, cropped jackets and hot pants. Clips, bracelets, and earrings in pastel-colored acetate stitched at the borders took the mind to Arte Povera, although her versions were obviously more elevated. Innately timeless, her coats register most classically bourgeois\u2014a good investment, in other words. At one point, Leroy mentioned the films of Claude Chabrol and Chantal Akerman as references that play a recurring role in her vision, and the visit took a turn towards name-that-movie and its corresponding stars, several no longer alive.

But we only see 20 percent of it\u2014behind that is the part you don\u2019t know about. I didn\u2019t. So we found some people who know how to access the dark net, behind the wall you can\u2019t see. I didn\u2019t know about it, but you can buy guns, drugs, people, order things with kids\u2014anything you want, with Bitcoin. It\u2019s crazy, scary stuff.

There is a dark side to humanity the censors won\u2019t let you see, but we will. View it at your own risk. What came next looked, for the most part, like a bunch of kids dressed to riot. At a time when there are indeed riots in Paris every Saturday\u2014targeting landmarks and stores\u2014we had truly entered the upside-down of fashion, and Gvasalia seemed to mean that almost literally. There were upside-down anarchy symbols; upended puffer jackets and T-shirts; misspelled but recognizable corporate logos; a faked Interpol sign (\u201clooks like Russian, but isn\u2019t\u201d). \u201cMade in Europe\u201d was printed on a track pant leg in the same fashion as U.S. prisonwear. \u201cWhat is Europe now?

There were references to many things that have become Vetements-isms: printed dresses, some chunky-jacketed pantsuits, and socks that are now sock-shoes, the antidote to the chunky dad trainer that Gvasalia invented, but has now been the first to swear off. Then came the really uncomfortable bit: the black fleece masks inside hoodies, the parkas with flaps extending right over the face, with a peep-hole for looking out, or for taking photos through. Gvasalia laughed at the idea that he\u2019s designed the latter for himself. \u201cI realize there is no privacy. When I\u2019m on public transport, doing work on my phone, I often see people overlooking it, or taking photographs of me.\u201d It struck all sorts of sinister chords about surveillance society, facial recognition technology. In a nutshell: fear. Gvasalia took a big risk with this show. It will undoubtedly be condemned as politically insensitive for a fashion label to have made a show with what looked like a gilets jaunes jacket bottom half. He is not mealy-mouthed about that though. \u201cI know why they are not happy. I understand the revolt of the people. It\u2019s a general problem of the world, the gap between rich and poor. And this is a third world war\u2014whatever you want to call it.\u201d The thing about Gvasalia and his brother Guram is that they know what trouble looks like, because they\u2019ve lived through a civil war themselves.

Social media metrics and trend analysis spreadsheets are helpful, but they can\u2019t provide the full picture. To tap into what\u2019s really happening with teens, you have to ask them.

Neither power suits nor the aggressively casual tech-CEO attire favored by previous generations feels right for today\u2019s socially conscious, conformity-rejecting kids, so Cupo skipped all of that in favor of remixing workwear standards. Nursing smocks, the short-sleeve button-downs favored by mechanics, and pleated schoolgirl skirts were all reimagined as pieces in a mix-and-match wardrobe that could take the wearer from the office to the rave. In shades of bright yellow, lavender, and pearlescent white, the practicality of Cupo\u2019s pieces was matched by its sense of fun. The concept of a jacket with a built-in backpack is as utilitarian as it gets, but it\u2019s also playful. The series of prints that were splashed on to denim skirts and blouses kept the kitschy energy going by mimicking the look of Midtown pawnshops and their ubiquitous \u201cWE BUY GOLD\u201d messaging, complete with dollar signs. Of course, it wasn\u2019t all fun and games\u2014Cupo\u2019s collection had a social conscience. With the words We die, they do nothing across caps and on the backs of bomber jackets, he referenced the battle cry of Reagan-era LGBTQ protestors whose HIV/AIDS activism challenged government and medical bureaucracy during a period when both refused to act. For Cupo, the statement remains vital and connected with the multitude of issues his audience faces and the current inaction from political leaders. \u201cWe\u2019re in an age of constant school shootings and nothing is being done. Trans women of color are still the most targeted [for violence] and nothing is being done,\u201d he said during a studio visit. \u201cRight now, I can\u2019t think of a more relevant message.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Victor Glemaud", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "\u201cAutumnal bliss,\u201d was how Victor Glemaud summed up the vibe of his new collection.

Moore and Glemaud first met in New York late last year, when they were sat next to each at a dinner. The connection was instant. \u201cI was calling her my Hispaniola sister on the shoot,\u201c said Glemaud, who, like Moore, has Caribbean roots and was born and raised in New York. \u201cShe\u2019s only 24, but so fierce and unapologetic about all the things she stands for.\u201d Life-size images of Moore modeling Glemaud\u2019s new collection hung from the walls of the designer\u2019s presentation at Spring Studios today.

There she was, dancing along a wall in Central Park in tangerine flares\u2014a style which has become a best seller for the brand\u2014and a matching crop top. Glemaud continues to bring new life to the oft-shunned knit maxi dress, and this season the most compelling of the lot came with a black and white curvilinear motif that was surprisingly flattering on the body. The designer pushed his previous experiments with fur accessories into ready-to-wear, and the sherbet-color fur cardigan was frothy and light in the best way. Technically speaking, today wasn\u2019t Glemaud\u2019s first fashion moment of the week. His clothes were featured on the runway of luxury plus-size retailer 11 Honor\u00e9.

In a season when spirits have gotten more than a little ground down (to put it mildly) by the sight of drab grays and browns set against an even gloomier political backdrop, Victoria Beckham\u2019s first look\u2014a white windowpane-checked skirt suit, and red blouse, worn with zingy scarlet stretch-leather spike-heeled boots\u2014was an instant mood-lifter. That vibrant red\u2014let\u2019s call it VB vermillion\u2014must do well for her, because it was scattered through her Spring collection, not to mention liberally repped by audience members. Here, for Fall, it popped up again, threaded through her proposal for pepping up the season in a collection she called \u201can A-Z of a woman\u2019s life.

She\u2019s proper, but she\u2019s not prim.\u201d Since she\u2019s come back to show on home ground in London, there\u2019s been something less clinical, more approachable about what Beckham does with her ready-to-wear. It hardly warrants a conceptual narrative to interpret this: She puts together flattering shapes and combinations of color which are persuasively easy to wear\u2014and all the more persuasive if she wears them herself, because there are millions of women and girls who hang on her every press appearance and Instagram story. The high-waisted flared pants in this collection got their introduction to her public in early January, when the Beckham famille made their way to a breakfast sortie at the Kent & Curwen menswear show that David is involved with. It\u2019s fair betting that the direction of this whole collection sprang from the popular feedback from that VB trouser teaser. Seventies flares led to bourgeois chain prints, pencil skirts, tiny argyle sweaters, and big pointed shirt collars as sure as night follows day. VB, of course, is a dress brand, and they looked good, too, when she hinted at \u201940s\u2013\u201970s silhouettes. There was nothing too literal, nothing too Love Story\u2013ish or Saint Laurent \u201970s about it. This is a collection by a modern woman for modern women.

The days of black, camel, and gray everything are pretty much over at Vince. Instead, the brand is leaning into its Los Angeles roots, from the sunny new colors to the way it shoots each collection and campaign. Fall 2019 was photographed on a rocky beach near Malibu, where models in quilted puffers, velvet slip dresses, and relaxed \u201csuits\u201d reclined in beach chairs or stood in mossy tide pools. The way those soft textures and lilac, \u201caloe,\u201d and burgundy colors looked against the raw, craggy backdrop was as important to Belhumeur as the designs themselves. She said it was all inspired by the Spanish sculptor Eduardo Chillida, known for his massive, abstract iron works in public spaces. His Comb of the Wind sculpture built into a cliff on the Cantabrian Sea was her specific jumping-off point, both for the lookbook setting and the palette; she liked how the rusty iron looked against the ocean\u2019s pale turquoise, and how its clean, industrial lines contrasted with the natural landscape. The knife-pleated aloe silk looks were a successful interpretation. It\u2019s a vibe that will resonate with a lot of women scrolling through Vince\u2019s website or Instagram. For such a clean brand, it\u2019s important to have a dreamy, emotional pull; it has to be about more than just clothes. That said, there were pieces here that felt inventive and surprising all on their own. With the tailoring trend in mind, Belhumeur wanted to figure out what a \u201cVince suit\u201d should look like, and landed on a few soft, ultralight wool jackets with matching pin-tucked trousers. Some had drawstrings at the waist, like a cross between sweats and \u201creal pants.\u201d Maybe they wouldn\u2019t pass at a hedge fund, but those suits would be a cool, considered break from standardized \u201cbusiness causal\u201d uniforms.

Trying to detect current trends in what she does is really beside the point. Her world is a deeply personal kaleidoscope of images, memories, and fantasies, patched together with a retro-tinged spirit.

Ponti recently changed her company\u2019s industrial business partner, which brought about a new energy. \u201cIt felt as if I were moving from an old apartment to a new one,\u201d she said; so for fall the idea of home was at the heart of the collection. Memories from Ponti\u2019s family home were enthusiastically translated into an abundance of prints, fabrications, embroideries, accessories\u2014she definitely went imaginatively overboard. An antique carpet belonging to her mother provided the floral pattern knitted onto an oversize cardigan; a padded bedspread was translated into a chubby pink capitonn\u00e9 piumino in techno duchesse. Sanderson roses printed on canvas, instead of gracing a comfortable upholstered couch, were cut into a trompe-l\u2019oeil hybrid blazer-jumpsuit; the round shape of a lampshade was the inspiration behind a puffy balloon skirt. The surrealist streak always favored by this designer was there in the patterns of a pink and baby blue velvet jacquard, whose curlicues at close inspection revealed profiles of teddy bears and purring kittens. The feisty majolicas of Joseph Holdcroft were morphed into an extravaganza of three-dimensional motifs appliqu\u00e9d on a spectacular leather coat. The pi\u00e8ces de r\u00e9sistance were a coat in curly wool from which sprouted almost a half-dozen vintage teddy bears and a voluminous piumino made from a patchwork of candy-colored ruched satin pillow covers.

It\u2019s more about the mood the photo suggests: She\u2019s on someone\u2019s shoulders, her hair\u2019s a mess, and, importantly, she\u2019s somewhere warm! Beattie was thinking about the free and comfortable way people dress for concerts (not Coachella, for the record). Something about hearing music outdoors inspires us to wear something vibrant yet low-key. The hallmarks of her Fall collection (which will arrive in stores in June, during peak summer concert season) were the A-line floral minidresses. Shown with high boots, they were a little \u201960s-ish and will register as a shock to Warm shoppers who\u2019ve been wearing below-the-knee hemlines for several years. What keeps a floral minidress from feeling basic is Beattie\u2019s eye for color. A turtleneck mini in a blown-up leaf print combined unlikely shades of mauve, navy, and blush pink; a striped shirtdress came in a pleasingly weird mix of brown and violet; and the tiered trapeze dress merged giant blooms with dots of Lurex. That color story applied to the longer, more familiar dresses, too: A sleek, no-frills maxi dress had a \u201cmushroom-y\u201d background with surprising hits of teal and crimson. Beattie said it\u2019s been difficult to get buyers to see the appeal of those strange colors, but the women who frequent her Nolita shop won\u2019t need any convincing.

This season, that meant tailoring of the manner that defined \u201990s icons like Tom Ford and Helmut Lang. We11done does not suffer delusions of that grandeur, of course; they\u2019re not here to reinvent the wheel. Instead, Kwon and Jung are engaged in the exercise of creating clothes for real women, of sorting through their past, present, and future to make something of the moment. Take the sky blue collared shirt, which was cut from such a thick bonded satin that it held its sculptural contours. That satin also worked wonderfully well on a sharp blazer in a classic deep aubergine color, closed by a single button to reveal a sliver of stomach. Despite the homage to classic high-end luxury, every leather item\u2014from the white patent snakeskin pant to the camel-hued stretch turtleneck to the boxy black pullover with snake-stamped pockets\u2014is vegan and all the fur is faux.

A peasant dress with Edwardian bib detailing came in a leopard print on a deep fuchsia backdrop with the spots in radioactive green and blue hues. A shirtdress with dropped peasant sleeves (so the puff started at the bicep) was covered in blown-out animal spots and saturated in lavender and green, all of which was a refreshing way to add a kick to the ubiquitous animal print. Prints aside, the silhouettes have an old-school charm. There was an extreme baby doll dress in burnt orange, a look that could appear childish, but, as Pozgay noted, it could also be toughened up with a pair of hefty combat boots. (Pozgay referenced Hole-era Courtney Love\u2019s style when talking about this piece.) Peasant blouses with bibs are no doubt popular right now, and Pozgay churned out several of them, including one in optic white with darts at the waist that artfully cinched the body inwards. While it appeared as if the shirt could have been worn a century ago, it was also modern thanks to the updated tailoring, and it was easy to imagine with a pair of jeans.

Not many marriages have such remarkable longevity, particularly in fashion. \u201cOur collaboration is a true friendship. Sportswear brands, they change designers every two years. Our roots are more deep,\u201d Yamamoto mused. That\u2019s why, when asked what he thought about the growing competition in the sportswear/street style market, he politely shrugged off the question, as if to say, \u201cAdidas and myself, we\u2019ve both been around long enough not to be worried about this.\u201d Nic Galway, Adidas\u2019s senior vice president of global design, chimed in: \u201cWe\u2019d rather be true to our world and not looking at what others are doing; in this collection we wanted to celebrate what brings us together, Yohji and us, what makes us unique.\u201d Indeed, the collection had a definite vintage flavor. \u201cWe looked back at the \u201970s, the \u201980s, and the \u201990s, pivotal creative times for both of us,\u201d said Galway. Archival pieces were re-engineered and imbued with an updated vibe. The very first sneakers Yamamoto designed for Adidas were also reissued in modernized versions for the show. \u201cThey still look fresh,\u201d said the designer. Then he smiled: \u201cA bit of nostalgia.\u201d The redesign of classic sportswear tropes seemed to be at the core of the collection; Yamamoto infused a fluid, genderless lineup with his unique poetic flair and exacting approach. The tracksuits were given an elevated attitude; elongated lines had an elegant ease, morphing varsity jackets into zippered ankle-grazing tunics. Volumes were roomy yet controlled, so the multiple-tiered layering didn\u2019t reach over-the-top proportions. Black enveloped the collection like a shroud; it wouldn\u2019t be Yohji\u2019s if it didn\u2019t. He just added a few touches of white, bright blue, and red for good measure. The logo was also played out in a balanced way, shown across chunky ribbed sweats or heat-transferred, emblazoning shiny varsity jackets. The most imaginative pieces in the collection were the workwear-inspired jumpsuits, shown throughout in various iterations for men and women. In nylon, matte jersey, or with contrasting inserts, they were a compelling proposition, notably when printed in a colorful, rather lysergic, abstract allover Japanese print called Toketa, referencing the Ikebana tradition. In the press notes, Yamamoto said the jumpsuits were intended as an alternative to eveningwear. As for the sneakers, they obviously had the lion\u2019s share of the attention; the most interesting were the reissues from the initial Y-3 collaboration, like the Mangostin, one of Yamamoto\u2019s favorite designs, which was updated as a low-profile racer with multi-fabric uppers. It made for a directional idea, a standout even in today\u2019s hyper-crowded sneakers arena."}, {"Designer": "Y\u2019s", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Longtime wearers of Y\u2019s will know that change exists within a narrow range. This is mostly a good thing; clothes purchased seasons ago remain relevant today, underscoring a coherent brand identity over time. The flip side is that newness is less noticeable (Doc Martens in traffic-sign yellow notwithstanding). But there was quite a bit to notice and appreciate among the Y\u2019s Black collection, which consisted of three themes (in order according to the lookbook): reversible garments, exposed construction, and various uniform interpretations. The first two excelled in skillful techniques, from two-sided constructions to contrast knit detailing. And the outcomes were manageable\u2014coats, for instance, were neither too voluminous nor overworked. The uniform grouping was broadest in scope, and the highlight here was a WWI\u2013inspired pinstripe trench that was liberated of structure and bleached so precisely that the lightened patches appeared fabric-blocked. Other standouts included the jacket with beaded embroideries that simultaneously referenced Persian carpets and war medals, or else the vivid blue jacquard robe coat patterned in a blurry mountain range. And there was something particularly appealing to the oversize down-filled coats that were sans seams, as though an insurmountable challenge had been solved (the padding was held in place from within). Seamless mohair sweaters and knit leggings turned up in the Y\u2019s Pink range, although this wasn\u2019t nearly as significant as an overall feminine thrust (relative to Black\u2019s mostly gender-neutral lineup). Vintage-style bookish blazers, faux-leather varsity jackets, men\u2019s shirts dolled up with lace, petticoats, and even a knit bustier were interesting building blocks for an artier projection of the brand. Apparently funkier, too, as the Prince-appropriated concert tees made clear."}, {"Designer": "Y/Project", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Consider the following. In mid-January, Y/Project\u2019s Glenn Martens presented his terrific men\u2019s collection for Fall 2019 during Pitti in Florence. Martens held it in the Cloister Grande of the historic church of Santa Maria Novella for a vast audience that held candles, the show\u2019s only means of illumination. A quick push on the fast-forward button and here we are today, a matter of weeks later, with his women\u2019s runway show comprising 48 looks. They veered from a superchic tweed coat spilling fake fur and trailing a scarf reminiscent of a Turkish carpet, to a long black satin skirt wittily conjured up from a pair of deconstructed pants, the waistband tucked and stitched to ever so slightly stand away from the waist in the most rakishly cool and offhand manner. All of this was rather impressively done by Martens and a team of just seven, which, given the way the fashion industry operates today, is positively minuscule. There\u2019s a lot of number crunching going on above, but here is the takeaway. Despite not having a whole army behind him, Martens possesses something possibly even better: a singular ambition as to what he (and his colleagues) can achieve with Y/Project. But to be clear; it\u2019s hunger tempered with humility\u2014and humor. When he was asked backstage postshow what the toughest thing about doing his women\u2019s collection was, Martens burst out laughing and replied, \u201cEverything about the last six weeks.\u201d Might well he say that. There was plenty that was compelling here, a designer stretching himself and clearly encouraging those around him to experiment and innovate\u2014and damned if he\u2019s going to give in to the lazy categorizations of what Y/Project can and should be. One thing it\u2019s time to retire: the tag \u201cstreetwear\u201d that has often been applied to the label, which always seemed a misnomer. There\u2019s no denying that Martens has been in the thrall of using everyday archetypes\u2014bombers, sweatshirts, jeans, shirts\u2014in such quotidian fabrics as cotton drill, denim, and fleecy synthetics. After all, why not? They\u2019re generationally appropriate, the very raw materials which speak of today for someone of his age (he\u2019s 35). But in reality they\u2019re used as springboards for all manner of historical silhouette play and recontextualization. This collection had some great examples of that: the ballooning double-layered sky blue shirt and the oversize washed trucker jacket lined in fuzzy fake fur, the hem cleverly cut to wrap back under itself."}, {"Designer": "Yajun", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Yajun Melody Lin loves to work with head-to-toe black, a perfectly fine personal preference that can be difficult to translate on the runway. She subverted that expectation this season by sending out three all-black looks, then shifting to a surprisingly earthy spectrum of creams, beiges, and browns that made it somewhat easier to see her intricate detailing. Sleep was a recurring motif, illustrated through wearable quilts and pillows. A sheeny off-white satin wrap and its Champagne-colored poncho twin stood out from the pack. The latter garment was punched with several different neck and arm holes for a wider range of styling options. Convertibility is Lin\u2019s chief calling card, and she continued to explore it through much cinching and layering, plus pockets on pockets. Next time, Lin should continue to push her methods forward\u2014more color, dare we say print.

I invite you to take the outfits enclosed and capture them in your own personal way.\u201d That\u2019s quite a bold surrender of control on the part of the designer. Its upside, however, is tangible: These images look good, are part of an idea that feels truly fresh, and come with the added bonus that designing with such a broad range of specific women in mind has nudged Li to work beyond his usual boundaries. For his old school buddy Lolita Jacobs (@loljacobs), for instance, Li cut a dark and dashing maternity dress\u2014new for him, he said. For Irina Shnitman (@irinashnitman), meanwhile, Li felt compelled to fashion a PVC evening dress he described as: \u201cvery sexy-sexy, something I don\u2019t usually do.\u201d But he can. Shnitman took her evening dress to the H\u00f4tel de Crillon for a statuesque vamp to truly do it justice, and she modeled one other look on a Metro platform in a shot that looks like finely composed surveillance footage. The most affecting image is of Genesis Breyer P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle (@pandrogyne), who is currently at home in New York undergoing treatment for leukemia. All of the earnings from the T-shirt she is wearing\u2014and which she codesigned with Li\u2014will be contributed to the costs of her care.

Sustainability has long been an essential aspect of Teng\u2019s work, but it has come full circle this season, with the designer creating pieces that incorporate fabrics from as far back as the early \u201990s. A double-faced silk that was used in evening dresses and capes back in 1993 now acts as the fabric in a box-sleeve jacket, and the highlighter yellow of a maxi skirt came from a man\u2019s sarong that Teng made for a party at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2003. Teng also used excess fabric to make other pieces. In December, she posted a photo to Instagram with the caption \u201cContemplating the scraps . . . \u201d They were eventually made into a nubby tank top and the stripes on tuxedo pants. Sometimes, Teng\u2019s conceptual approach isn\u2019t apparent to the naked eye. One waffled wool coat looked like a normal robe on the body, but when it was placed on the ground, it was a perfect circle. Teng pointed out that the sleeves were crafted out of old, unused material. The idea of using leftovers works for Teng, and for many years it has looked quite chic.

Instead of a runway show or a presentation, he showcased his Fall 2019 collection with a video installation titled Reflection. He wanted to lift the curtain on his design process and shine a light on the way that he works. The film captures him in action: fitting the model in the garments in front of a mirror, then having her walk back and forth while he studies the movement, the angles, and the proportions both on the model herself and in her reflection. This footage was projected in three frames on the giant white wall of a gallery space in Chelsea. In the corner of the room was also a full-length floor mirror, which reflected the movement happening on the wall. Azrou\u00ebl\u2019s exhibition and installation will be open to the public until February 27. He hopes that visitors, including the reviewers and buyers who passed through the space this week and saw the actual garments hanging on several racks, will gain an appreciation for the craftsmanship behind his designs. In his own words, \u201cThe process is always more interesting for me than the end result.\u201d For Fall, the end result was also interesting. The pinstripe sweatsuit in sumptuous cashmere looked just as cool and comfortable in real life as it did in the video. Same goes for the thick cable-knit sweaters and the orange-and-eggplant-checked coat and matching trousers. Azrou\u00ebl\u2019s dresses were quite nice, too, especially a houndstooth-print frock with lace detailing at the shoulders. This season, like every season, really, Azrou\u00ebl\u2019s designs speak to a certain woman who wants to live her life in an unfussy, beautiful wardrobe, one that\u2019s thoughtfully tailored and fits her like a glove. This all comes not from a single reference or a key source of inspiration but instead from Azrou\u00ebl\u2019s inherent process.

But if anyone\u2019s mind went straight to the political\u2014especially given this week\u2019s scandal in France, when a sporting goods chain began offering a running hijab\u2014the designer\u2019s reference point was actually historical. Specifically, as a little Googling confirmed, women known as tampada lime\u00f1a from 17th-century Spain who shrouded all but their left eye in black to entice men. Sure enough, one of these present-day runway coquettes pulled back her sheath, revealing it to be a skirt layer of a frontier-style dress. For a designer who is constantly exploring seduction\u2014though rarely in ways most of us recognize\u2014this was a fitting finale to yet another permutation from Yamamoto\u2019s darkly poetic playbook. It reinforced just how easily the layers of fabric within so many of his looks can be shifted around, repositioned, and adapted at will. This was a lineup defined largely by its vertical thrust, from the beautiful column-like fluted pleating extending down coats to the long, slim sleeves and stand-alone upward collars. There was tufting and tacking, wrapping and tearing, draping and cape-ing\u2014most of it controlled enough to wear. In some instances, there was colorful hand-painting\u2014including Fauvist-style shapes across a ballooning back\u2014that initially suggested a less somber outing than previous seasons. Yet amid the sculpted fabric hands that sprung from a few different looks, there was an unambiguous sign that Yamamoto\u2019s roguish side has not gone soft: one was giving the middle finger, front and center. For while Yamamoto has stayed true to himself, resisting the tidal forces of fashion, he\u2019s now 75 and confronting the inevitability that he will not be designing forever. \u201cI feel so lonely and struggling in Paris mode,\u201d he said, using the French word for fashion. \u201cI\u2019m losing so many competitors.\u201d He was, of course, referring to fellow masters (and friends) Azzedine Ala\u00efa and Karl Lagerfeld. Which is why, rather than an expression of mourning, he wants to reassure us that this collection signaled a renewed spirit, an f-you to endings: \u201cI was enjoying; I became like a young girl, and making clothing was deep fun\u2014not like some great master of fashion.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Zac Posen", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Zac Posen\u2019s lookbooks have lately starred Maya Thurman Hawke or Katie Holmes, but why settle for one icon when you can have a group of them?

The multigenerational nature of the cast was absolutely the point. \u201cI dress all ages of women,\u201d he added. \u201cDiversity is beauty.\u201d The young and the less so turn to Posen when they need a statement-making gown. He dressed Julia Garner in turquoise taffeta jacquard at the SAG Awards last month and Laverne Cox in red silk charmeuse at the National Board of Review. There are Oscar contenders in his new lineup, to be sure, though he pointed out that more and more actresses and celebrity stylists are requesting one-of-a-kind dresses that have never appeared on a runway or in a lookbook. He also noted that the phenomenon puts a strain on small labels, even ones with ateliers in-house like Posen\u2019s. In any case, lucky would be the starlet who got to make her grand entrance in the midnight blue pliss\u00e9-flocked tulle. Considering the relatively small number of women who have red carpets to walk, Posen gave equal emphasis to his daywear here. Pleated jersey separates obviously echoed the occasion frocks; ditto the pants that he cut so wide, they rivaled his ballgown volumes. More unusual for Posen, and also compelling, was a cozy, long-sleeve cable-knit dress.

This was really Posen\u2019s main focus for Fall, considering the fact that it\u2019s his bestselling category in the contemporary market. After six years, the designer has definitely found his sweet spot with ZZP, as he likes to call it, in terms of marrying a moderate price point with garments that are beautifully made with the same glamour and attention to detail as his high-end main line. His eveningwear exemplifies this strategy and is still in high demand with buyers from major (and still thriving) department stores like Nordstrom. This season, Posen\u2019s black-tie offering included floor-sweeping gowns in a lovely emerald green ribbed Lurex and a striking, off-the-shoulder balloon silhouette in a gold floral jacquard. There were plenty of covetable cocktail and daytime-ready pieces as well, including a black metallic peasant dress and one embellished with textile-inspired fringe. ZZP doesn\u2019t offer a wide variety of separates, but that\u2019s not really what the contemporary line is about anyway.

Basketball\u2019s stars and the lanky kids who walk the runway have more in common than one might think, and their ability to pull off distinctive fashion is part of what makes them thrilling to watch. Zadig and Voltaire\u2019s Cecilia B\u00f6nstr\u00f6m tapped into the connection with a spirited Fall collection that placed souped-up versions of NBA team logos on the backs of street style\u2019s cool kids. B\u00f6nstr\u00f6m\u2019s vision for Zadig and Voltaire has always been informed by a Parisian sensibility and rock \u2019n\u2019roll edge, but the continued coalescence of entertainment fields means sports now boasts the same glamorous associations as music. Admit it, Iman Shumpert and Jordan Clarkson are probably better dressed than the majority of today\u2019s guitar heroes, so it makes sense to add a few team mascots into the NYFW mix. The collaboration took on multiple forms; fringed knitwear on Alton Mason bore a deconstructed Lakers logo, and a maroon letterman jacket with various patches provided a solid choice for anyone who has yet to settle on a favorite team. The further the pieces moved from being fancier versions of what you\u2019d find at the NBA store, the better they worked. A sparkle-and-stripe-covered Memphis Grizzlies jumper was the kind of piece that subverts expectations, and exactly what a high-fashion-meets-sports mashup should be about. Elsewhere, B\u00f6nstr\u00f6m played with Zadig and Voltaire\u2019s codes, offering up plenty of denim but continuing to push into eveningwear territory. Fans may have come for the jeans, but they\u2019re likely to enjoy the dressier fare even more. Tuxedo jackets worn with little bow ties, shimmering mini-dresses paired with combat boots, and jumpsuits covered in a spray of tiny flowers were all beautiful, but on occasion things felt too familiar. The benchmarks of Gallic cool have never been more prominent, and when designers adhere to them moments of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu are inevitable.

Zanini was in Japan last summer, and he came back with kimono silks that he\u2019s cut into seamless bias dresses, the narrow fabric winding loosely down the body of the dress. He can make them in limited editions of two, a small number he embraces because it\u2019s in keeping with his more intimate approach. \u201cA lot of us are looking for something special, not overexposed.\u201d Zanini\u2019s instincts are right on.

It was easy to make connections between the dancers on the screen and Cornejo\u2019s clothes. In one scene, a young man gesticulates on the edge of a quarry in an easy button-down and chinos. There was nothing as conventional as that here, despite the fact that Cornejo said she was working with classics, but the designer does have a healthy respect for the human form, and she makes clothes that enable its movement. Take the black velvet track pants she was wearing with a black silk linen doppio blazer. With their elasticized waist and nearly weightless hand, yet polished attitude, they were the subject of much admiration. Equally as touchable as that velvet: recycled cashmere knits with a three-dimensional loop stitch; nubby alpaca jackets and coats; the pebbled silk of slip dresses; and corduroy, wide-wale and thin, that she used for a round-shouldered trench and one of her signature mechanic suits, respectively. Cornejo said that she\u2019d considered blindfolding people at the appointments so they could feel their way through the racks. Pina would\u2019ve approved.

Wake was responsible for freeing thousands of persecuted people in France and assisting the country in its fight against the Germans. As Zimmermann explained in her show notes, she was inspired by Wake\u2019s story because she \u201cloved the idea of such a feminine, skillful, and selfless figure\u2014a woman who helped people in the most difficult of circumstances.\u201d Her Fall 2019 collection served as a modern retelling of Wake\u2019s life through the clothing Zimmermann imagined her wearing today. Beautiful, supple leather trenchcoats paired with berets were the most obvious of the spy-ready wardrobe, as were bomber jackets and hooded anoraks. Zimmermann\u2019s knit balloon-sleeve minidress and knee-high boot combination also felt like a sexy nod to the mystery woman, as did the burgundy leather midi skirt and the blush belted jumpsuit. The designer always incorporates some of her signature bohemian-style frocks, but this time out, the floral-printed pieces didn\u2019t exactly fit in with the Wake backstory. But Zimmermann\u2019s strength this season was in her expansion of offerings. There were more knits, more dress silhouettes, more texture, and more prints.

A representative recounted Jordan\u2019s recent family safari in Kenya, all personal pictures of giraffes and Masai people smiling against the bright sunset pinned up on a mood board. The clothes were cut to match: sporty, all-purpose garments with a vibrant palette inspired by the Masai\u2019s iconic red-and-cobalt check pattern. Wisely enough, Jordan reinterpreted the Masai\u2019s garments instead of remaking them. Her collection of dyed knitwear drew from the contrast of rich colors against the savanna. Beige and gray zebra-print sweatsuits contrasted with electric pink and blue tie-dye cardigans and trousers.

Where does Jordan want to stand?"}, {"Designer": "Zuhair Murad", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "East meets West is an oft visited trope, but Zuhair Murad tackled it with gusto. At times, the result was beguiling. Murad\u2019s core customer counts on him for much muchness. But when the designer reins it in a bit on the trimmings, he makes a stronger case. Take, for example, an exercise in samurai culture. The anchor was the onna-bugeisha female warriors of the Japanese nobility, filtered through a prism of intricate laces and gold-studded panel skirts, while also roping in Art Deco and manga influences, notably through the sensual, bondage-inflected work of Araki. Yes, it\u2019s a lot, but the designer showed a deft hand. Araki\u2019s photos of flowers on the wane, a nod to vanitas, informed a more profound exercise than one might typically expect from this house. The shaved-out blush furs were interesting, too, even if they looked more like topiary from Versailles than anything from Asia. Romance with a darker tinge\u2014large-scale florals on a black ground\u2014worked well for him. So did the dark tweed jacket and skater dress. Iridescent placements on a black leather sheath dress nodded to Art Nouveau. A riff on obi belts, with a crane motif on a sharply tailored black satin coat or full-on sequins, looked like it was aiming for the realm of art. Elsewhere were the lacier numbers in nude or black, or the suits with jeweled closures that appeal to the designer\u2019s classic base (with all the time in fitting rooms with brides-to-be and their female relatives, he\u2019s got plenty of feedback to work with). But perhaps his best exercise was an exploration of shakud\u014d ornamentation, an age-old process based on copper alloy with a low gold content known as \u201cblack gold,\u201d which can produce a lacquer-like finish. The designer transposed this idea to grandiose effect on a sunray dress in intricate gold rays on a black ground. Though ornate, in Murad\u2019s world, it was an exercise in (relative) restraint. It must be torment for a designer like Murad to hold back when his first reflex is to lavish a dress with everything he\u2019s got. But when he pulls it off, he does it to stunning effect."}, {"Designer": "3x1", "Season": "Fall", "Year": "2019", "Text": "Scott Morrison is happy to report that longer inseams\u2014with finished hems, not shredded ones!\u2014are trickling back into fashion. The one downside is that we\u2019ll have to start actually getting our jeans hemmed again. Most women have gotten used to DIY-ing the process at home with a pair of scissors; it\u2019s the easiest way to get your perfect, above-the-ankle length with frayed edges (pro tip: Use a nail file to rough them up even more). That won\u2019t exactly work with Fall\u2019s new, more elegant jeans, though. If getting to a tailor sounds like an insurmountable task, 3x1 makes it easy: Any pair you buy in the store can be hemmed on the spot. That\u2019s the charm of having your workshop smack in the middle of your retail space. In general, Morrison is feeling a shift toward those more polished, elevated jeans. Consider Fall\u2019s side-split bootcut pair, an interpretation of a similar 3x1 style Bella Hadid has worn. Needless to say, they\u2019ve been in demand ever since. Morrison called them \u201cskinny flares,\u201d not bootcut, and the slits beg to be worn over stiletto heels (yep, those might be back, too). The dark-rinse bustier jumpsuit looked like something Hadid would wear as well\u2014and not with sneakers for a trip to the bodega. She\u2019d wear it with sky-high heels, crystal earrings, and slicked-back hair for a night out. Denim designers are tasked with including tons of variety, though, so those dressed-up jeans covered just a fraction of the line.

Fall 2019 has the answer, and it\u2019s very, very good.

The only print to speak of was a graphic zebra motif that was primed for the concrete jungle on high-waisted pencil skirts and oversize carryalls that several models carried tucked under one arm.

Humberto Leon and Carol Lim used the energy, money, and time they would have otherwise spent to photograph their spring 2020 collection on a cast of Mexican and Mexican-American actors, artists, activists, and creatives. Leon likened the multiday shoot that brought together Jessica Alba, chef Daniela Soto-Innes, dog whisperer Cesar Millan, drag star Valentina, and immigration activist Cristina Martinez, among others, to making a film. (He would know: he directed a short at Kenzo starring Milla Jovovich.) The look book and forthcoming videos are the latest in OC\u2019s Year of Mexico, which has brought Mexican designers and crafts to the shop floor. The choice to celebrate Mexico at a time when the \u201cleader\u201d of the \u201cfree\u201d world wants to erect a wall on the border is clearly a political one. Underneath the serape-colored separates and big, ruffled blouses, this is, after all, a very real fight over who gets to call where home. This collection and shoot also mark a homecoming for Lim and Leon, who, earlier this year, ended an eight-year contract with Kenzo as creative directors to tend to the brand they built. Their renewed focus on OC has allowed the feelings of multiculturalism, playfulness, and quirky artistry that they built into their stores and collections to shine through more brightly. With Mexico as a design reference, Leon said this season\u2019s goal was to \u201cmake a collection that feels real and wearable.\u201d No big logos, no super-cute prints. Instead: spiced-up essentials that come with a touch of gawkiness, like cobalt knit sets with beaded fringe or workwear jackets trimmed in quincea\u00f1era ruffles.

There are also a number of collaborations within the collection, like swaggy pastel suiting from J. Press, leopard-print Dickies, and a three-way mash-up with a sports brand and an A-list athlete that is under deep embargo until the athlete wears the pieces to a game this fall. The diverse cast in the look book proves that these clothes will work across ages and aesthetic sensibilities.

There\u2019s also the issue of synthetics like polyester, elastane, and Lycra replacing cotton and natural fibers, and the difficulties of recycling denim that includes those blended fibers or stretch. If fixing all of that sounds daunting, J Brand makes it look pretty easy: In the past few seasons, the company has greatly reduced its use of bleach, turned recycled denim scraps into housing insulation, and created proprietary washing techniques that use 90% less water. The company has even developed its own alternative to pumice stones, which have traditionally been used to distress and soften jeans. The mining of pumice has a massive carbon footprint, and as the stones disintegrate the dust particles are often inhaled by workers or dumped into rivers. Their alternative resists that breakdown and can be reused over and over. With all of that in mind, J Brand boldly called its spring 2020 collection \u201cthe world\u2019s most sustainable premium denim to date.\u201d That mostly applied to the blue jeans on display in the showroom; they\u2019re still figuring out how to produce ivory and off-white jeans without using any bleach. The indigo flares and cropped straight-legs with the \u201csustainable\u201d tag were made mostly of cotton and utilize those low-waste washing processes. Eventually all of the above will be considered standard practice for denim companies, and we\u2019ll be able to refocus our attention back to design. On that note, J Brand is embracing wider legs and longer lengths for 2020: The opening pair had a generous flared proportion with a trouser hem, while a boot-cut jean had a slimmer, leaner cut. Both came in the label\u2019s \u201creal-life rigid\u201d denim, which combined 98% cotton with just a touch of stretch. They\u2019re meant to skim over your shoes, a hint that the days of above-the-ankle crops are coming to an end. The other big news for J Brand was its introduction of \u201cinclusive sizing,\u201d spanning sizes 33 to 38. The patternmakers didn\u2019t just build out the sizes of their current selection but cut new patterns and held multiple fittings to perfect each style.

That organic, naturalistic approach to design makes Ace & Jig a very desirable uniform for the contingent that actually resides in Byron Bay.

They also know how to promote their enviable lives on Instagram, giving their followers an intimate view into what seems to be an idyllic oceanside life.

Frieze art fair falls on the end of fashion month and made an ideal platform for this emerging brand that might have otherwise gotten swallowed up during Fashion Week. Held inside The Standard, London Library space and presented by MatchesFashion.com, the duo\u2019s presentation was concise but ambitious.

Symonds Pearmain is about wearability with added fashion cred. The knitwear coordinates looked fresh and best played out in a navy-and-white rugby stripe skirt and top made in the Pringle factory. The fine pastel knits were made in a traditional underwear factory in Leicester. The duo pride themselves on producing everything in the U.K. with fabric from dead stock suppliers. \u201cWe produce small quantities and do not overprice and subsequently discount,\u201d added Symonds. The models circled around a sculpture of plastic dust sheets placed by the duo\u2014both Slade School of Fine Art alums\u2014and their team before the show. Their makeshift audacity feels almost of a different era of London fashion: that of the club scene. The \u201980s current runs strong through the styling (pelerine school socks and Symonds Pearmain\u2013branded duct tape kitten heels) and the actual clothing. \u201cI wanted it to be about protective macs. Not chic trench coats, but macs. It felt more \u201980s and real\u201d said Symonds of the retina-jarring yellow and pink waterproofs. All macs were shown with collars drawn up to resemble high ruffs, that were, in fact, oversized Peter Pan collars that ruched when pulled. \u201cIf it\u2019s a bit inclement, you can go up, or if you\u2019re just feeling a bit dramatic,\u201d said Symonds. With climate change looming and the only certainty being unpredictability, such focus on durability seems timely. \u201cI was really interested in things that persist and just go on, like this idea of these wax fabrics, which you just keep waxing, and they remain, and you keep them for life,\u201d Symonds added. As traditional ways of showing are constantly being questioned, Pearmain was pleased that the art setting allowed for a more intimate and nuanced conversation. But, of course, at the end of the day, we are all speaking in a commercial language. So to an age-old debate: Is fashion art or art fashion? \u201cNeither is either,\u201d laughed Pearmain. \u201cWe make fashion and sometimes show in an art context.

If, at first glance, the pattern that appears throughout Leroy\u2019s latest collection looks like yet another toile de Jouy variation, it actually comes from a random vaguely Moroccan landscape drawing she found at a flea market and developed into a print. The designer said this spoke to her as capturing a distinctly arty vibe that she expanded upon with edgy poet blouses (ruched yet angled shoulders, billowy sleeves) and an update to her trademark fluid trousers. Their shape seemed looser than usual, yet she also cleverly created an instant tailoring hack with a knotted cord accessory that fastens like an anklet. Other interesting developments included an artisanal material from England that could best be described as lace adjacent; it made a pretty impression as both a polished shirt and a fringed skirt. Also Leroy continues to do wonders with windbreaker material, shaping it in ways that you might be inclined to wear regardless of weather. But back to the print: Leroy has such a strong sense of color that you get the sense she avoids busy motifs in order to not disturb such a carefully calibrated palette. Here, though, she found a pleasing middle ground\u2014and seemed to enjoy doing so, from the bikini tops that could be worn frontward or backward and over or under tops, to the accessible scarves and bags.

For Spring her kaleidoscopic safari includes many multicolored patches of elephants and monkeys; purple hippos; and painted giraffes\u2014and also some very pretty naive prints inspired by South African textiles.

So were clothes that wended their way from safari to jungle flora, stripes, and rescaled checks. A bright blue suede jacket with wings of beaded fringe will probably be the highest-ticket item in a lineup that was full-on fun.

When it opens in November or so, the space will follow Mikati\u2019s philosophy of showrooms and life with an ever-evolving roster of artist collaborations, much in the spirit of a curtain of handwoven ribbons the artist Megan Geckler set up for the Paris presentation. There will be non-fashion items she loves too, such as a juice bar or maybe things she picks up in her travels, like Japanese candy. \u201cIt\u2019s a little dollhouse townhouse, but I put all my dreams in it because I think we can represent the world,\u201d the designer said.

There was barely a second between the flash of lightning and crash of thunder that signaled a deluge so dense that guests screamed out loud at the ferocity of it. There would be some very damp editors at Louis Vuitton later. One way to spin it, however, is that Louise Trotter caught a lucky break. Had the show run five minutes later, her grand gesture would have been a washout. In this collection, perhaps only a long tan gabardine trench with a Lacoste green croc on its chest would have been able to protect its wearer, at least a bit, from the downpour, had it hit during a finale that saw the models walk out on the clay of the Court Simonne-Mathieu in Paris\u2019s Roland-Garros tennis complex. Lacoste is more than a tennis brand, yet its origin lies in tennis, so it was right to bring us way out west to this venue. It was also right that Trotter both simplified her game plan and upped her focus this season by presenting a collection of clothes which, beyond the crocs stitched onto that trench or onto the sleeve of a yellow suit worn by Maggie Maurer or printed on the house-green silk pants worn by Leon Dame, conveyed both Lacoste and luxury quite convincingly. The oversized waffled short-sleeve shirts in graphic color mixes were refinements of the famous preppy pique shirt this brand sells by the bucketload, and while luxurified, they retained the ease of the original. Trotter is a big leather lover, a passion she indulged here via slouchy rib-hemmed pants and a leather neckerchief styling story that looked okay enough. The leather-collared and -pocketed full-length polo shirtdress worked nicely, and there was a pleasant and not overplayed silhouette story in the ribbed waist shape that connected a green poplin dress and a white pleated skirt.

They set the tone for their show in Paris this afternoon with a runway that was flooded with natural light. The London-based duo is beginning to carve out a distinctive vocabulary for their brand with their thought-provoking sense of color and elongated, \u201990s-style tailoring. Georgina Grenville was among the top models who helped define that look first time around, famously starring in several of Tom Ford\u2019s ad campaigns for Gucci. She made a surprise appearance at the show today, dressed in a cream two-piece suit, a pale yellow polo, and pointy-square-toe mules that echoed those bygone proportions. Dickely and La loosened up the rigid outerwear of Fall with easy trench coats that came imbued with an extra dose of cool thanks to chain belts made in collaboration with Himo Martin of the jewelry label Pearls Before Swine. Industrial accessories have been all the rage lately, but the Kwaidan pair managed to mark theirs with subtle details; think, hoop earrings engraved with the work of American lyricist Dory Previn and chunky chokers dipped in red latex. The kinky fabric showed up in the ready-to-wear too, most notably on the Pepto pink coated denim jackets, though it would be hard to imagine the latex slip dresses finding a place in the real world. The figure-hugging jersey dresses and waist-cinching jersey blazers were altogether more believable and spoke to a body-conscious mood that\u2019s come into focus for Spring on both sides of the pond. The pair behind Kwaidan Editions are part of a new generation of young designers staking their claim on the Paris fashion scene.

Said the designer: \u201cI was really interested in the idea that his philosophy was to enjoy the finer things in life in general, but also that you only need three things to be happy: friendship, freedom, and thought. And working in this industry, I just thought that was a fascinating concept. Also, I read that his philosophy got misconstrued into luxury. So this is a starting point of the collection, and I wanted to contrast some simpler things with more excessive things. I liked this story that he started a commune outside of Athens, where they threw wild orgies: That inspired some of the pieces.\u201d Chain necklaces, link bracelets, and bronze earrings designed to resemble a breast were hints toward the Hellenic slap-and-tickle on Ellery\u2019s radar, as were the piercing style fastenings on many of the garments. Long draped pastel dresses, cinchable with shoelace-thin vegan leather cord, were serene and stately. A black vegan-leather trench with scarlet belt buckles hinted again at excess. A fitted black dress lined with monochrome ostrich feather and a print of an extraordinarily long-billed duck of a species Ellery could not identify were avian asides. A white, chevron-shaved off-the-shoulder top, a silk patchwork dress in diagonal neutral stripes, and the dresses and shoes dyed in two ranges of four appealing stripes of color were all garments you could imagine generating happiness. Under questioning, Ellery conceded that the reason one of her commercial collection T-shirts has a map of Antarctica on it is that her great-great-grandfather was the famous explorer Ernest Shackleton. Wow! As well as being stranded near the South Pole in pack ice and nearly perishing on the escape, Shackleton is famous for purportedly placing this marvelous ad in theLondon Times: \u201cMen wanted for hazardous journey, small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful\u2026\u201d At the end of Fashion Month, you can, like, relate."}, {"Designer": "Chanel", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The eternal and international attraction of being a French girl with \u201cthe knack\u201d has been a thread that has run through some of the major Parisian houses and their major \u201cexperiential\u201d shows this season. Virginie Viard, in her first ready-to-wear outing since the passing of Karl Lagerfeld, followed suit with her practical breakdown of a Chanel wardrobe for a young woman. It was up in the air in one way: on a set evoking the gray, zinc-lined rooftops of the Rue Cambon; and down to earth in another: a contemporary girl\u2019s how-to instruction kit grounded in the heritage of Coco Chanel. Up on the roof chez Chanel, a flat-heeled procession of leggy girls set out in tweed playsuits, tiny silk shorts, gar\u00e7onne coatdresses, and little bell-shaped skirts. Where Lagerfeld might\u2019ve thrown on funny, punning accessories, Viard\u2019s instinct was to strip back and emphasize the essentials of silhouette and tweedy Chanel textures in a relatable context\u2014who could dare mimic his wit, after all? She said in a press release that she\u2019d drawn a connection between the rooftop scenery and the \u201catmosphere of the Nouvelle Vague\u201d\u2014the French New Wave cinema of the 1950s and 1960s, famous for portraying young actresses in the honest light of real life. Kristen Stewart\u2019s new biopic of the life of Jean Seberg had gelled that idea in her mind. At one point, an echo of Seberg\u2019s T-shirt and jeans (the actress\u2019s classic appropriation of French working-class style in Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s 1960 movie Breathless) inspired a neat casualization of a Chanel twinset as a Breton-striped cropped jacket and sweater with high-waisted cropped denims and a chain belt. On the other hand, wasn\u2019t it Coco Chanel who thought up that combination on the Riviera in the 1920s? What we look for in Chanel as a storied couture house is to be reminded of\u2014and thrilled by\u2014that sort of time-traveling relevance. The tiered, tufted layers of the plays on tweed (the inimitable magic of the in-house textile department) that appeared among all the flouncy skirts Viard sent out did that as well. Ditto a couple of Chanel mini coatdresses, one with a silver sequined flip of a skirt, the other tailored, navy, with silk ruffles on the collar and pockets. At the end of the day, who doesn\u2019t want to belong to the ranks of the Chanel It girls? When a tweed-suited girl with a hat jumped up from the audience and jauntily swung her quilted Chanel bag in step with the models, plenty in the audience thought she was a preplanned punch line to the show. Not at all. It was a prank by 28-year-old French YouTuber and comedian Marie Benoliel. The security guards didn\u2019t like it, and the models soon realized she was an imposter. But then again, she was perfectly dressed, and everyone in the auditorium laughed along with her. You couldn\u2019t help thinking how Karl Lagerfeld would\u2019ve been amused, because isn\u2019t that the essence of what Chanel girl actually wants to be today\u2014chic and a lot of fun?"}, {"Designer": "We11done", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "\u201cDual Attraction\u201d is the latest collection from Dami Kwon and Jessica Jung of We11done, the rising South Korean label born from their boundary-pushing concept shop Rare Market.

The members of the London Contemporary Orchestra kept playing the modern classical piece composed by Isobel Waller-Bridge (sister of Phoebe) for the show. The audience kept clapping and cheering. No one rushed out of the venue, even though it was late and dinner beckoned. Time took a breather, essentially. And, wonderfully enough, this was the message Burton hoped to achieve with her offering this season. As she wrote in her voluminous show notes, \u201cI love the idea of people having the time to make things together, the time to meet and talk together, the time to reconnect to the world.\u201d In practice what this amounted to was that the entire McQueen staff\u2014not just the studio but even the HR department\u2014completely hand-embroidered two of the dresses shown on the catwalk. Inspired by a London group called the Stitch School, which teaches boys and girls needlework, the staff sat together and chain stitched and silk knotted over the line drawings of Central Saint Martins students, who had sketched on a single giant sheet during a life drawing class at the McQueen store in London. All of those students were credited in the show notes. Talk about community spirit! And talk about a value-rich backstory. Here are a few things one needs to know about Burton\u2019s 42 designs shown tonight. She upcycled lace, organza, and tulle from prior seasons. She recycled and reinvented old patterns from both her and Alexander McQueen\u2019s history. She worked primarily with linen from Northern Ireland and linen made from flax grown at a particular female-owned farm\u2014a farm that had until recently housed livestock. She created damasks with the sole remaining linen weaver in Ireland. She created lustrous, light-as-paper linens with the sole remaining beetler in Ireland (beetling is a process in which linen is covered in potato starch and then pounded on a wood machine for hours on end). She designed embroideries of vivid, blooming endangered flowers for a dress of silk faille and an ivory suit. As with her Fall 2019 offering, Burton cut her tailoring from British mohair sharkskin, a worsted wool from mills in the north of England. Local, repurposed, conscious, artisanal. And spectacularly beautiful. This was by far the most exquisite collection of the season to date. Every piece was purposeful and important: a black evening suit with a slashed jacket to create a new spin on tails, with a lace-trimmed shirt elegantly spilling out; a simple day dress in black beetled linen with a pin-tucked bodice and exuberantly puffed sleeves; a tiny strapless frock in hand-pleated, hand-cut pale blue organza meant to resemble a flax flower; an ivory sweaterdress with a tiered skirt and sleeves knit so fine as to resemble tulle; a trench in raw linen and black wool with a flirtatious backside. There were looks that demanded a red carpet or a wedding day\u2014an asymmetric explosion of lace and ruffles anchored by half of a tailored jacket\u2014and others that demanded a smart office (the most powerful suits anywhere) or a very chic day (a patched, striped shirtdress with swaggering sleeves and a sleek bodice). There was a slashed knit frock in navy for a hot date, and a draped number in ivory crochet for an even hotter one. This is the wardrobe of which dreams are made, and it arrived in a season sorely in need of such heady imaginings. But there was nothing insubstantial going on here. Sarah Burton has always made incredibly lovely clothes for the house of McQueen; she just has that very rare gift. But in the past few seasons, and tonight more than ever, she proved something far, far lovelier. When you make things with the right values, when you treat the earth and its citizens and their traditions with care and respect, when you endeavor to reimagine what might once have been tossed aside or away, when you take the time to truly care about every piece you create, you simply make better things. With great thought comes great beauty\u2014magnificence, really. This was the lesson in sustainability that every corporate leader in fashion needed to be taught. Tonight they went to stitch school with Sarah Burton."}, {"Designer": "Beautiful People", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Beautiful People\u2019s show invitation was a paper pop-up of a rib-cage cutout. A little disconcerting, sure, but designer Hidenori Kumakiri\u2019s unconventional and slightly surreal approach shouldn\u2019t be surprising. In the past he has shrunken outfits to resemble kids\u2019 garments, and his favorite stylistic play is adding or peeling away layers of fabrics in endless shapeshifter games, a metamorphic design process which, even if complex and sometimes frankly puzzling, look as if made by a sweet, irreverent child. The paper rib cage popping out from the invitation was obviously intended as a metaphor: As the designer explained through a translator, just as the breathing expands the body\u2019s internal space, in the same way, juxtaposed layers of fabric allow expanded possibilities for the wearer to transform a top, a tunic, or a dress into something different. To give an example of this rather arcane concept, a dress made by three layers of mesh tulle with three holes (for the sleeves and for the neck) can be worn by inserting the body between one of the layers and one of the holes of choice, twisting its shape asymmetrically and giving the dress an unexpected life. Layering being apparently the collection\u2019s mot d'ordre, a layer of meaning was further added to the already convoluted narrative. The designer explained that he wanted to highlight the concept of transformation, presenting 24 looks, as many as the hours of the day, going from night to dawn. The color palette then progressed through 24 gradients, morphing from black to pale, delicate colors. Kumakiri personally helped a model on stage to modify the lines of a multilayered A-line dress, wearing it in different ways. It would\u2019ve helped the appreciation of the elaborate but clever modifying process if the clothes could\u2019ve been observed up close. The models stormed the catwalk at a quick pace; the dresses looked appealing, with simple but inventive shapes; the mutating game had a sweet feel. Yet perhaps a more intimate format would\u2019ve been more suitable to give the collection the attention it deserved."}, {"Designer": "Zuhair Murad", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Picking up where he left off for Resort, Zuhair Murad continues to travel through Spain, mining its traditions, architecture, and culture\u2014this time mainly in the Balearic Islands. In a concise showroom presentation, the designer brought together multiple references to striking architectural features, reprising in embroidered organza-wrought iron motifs from the Comares Palace and the Alhambra or transposing artisanal tiles that one finds in Seville into prints or sequined flora on mesh overlays. In his color palette, Murad nodded to artists such as Picasso (in his Blue Period) and Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla, whose palette and particular way of catching light was a primary inspiration. The designer also sampled freely from the garden, incorporating pixelated flowers, fractal digital art, and sunset colors, which came together kaleidoscopically on dresses and, notably, on a fully sequined cocktail dress that looked like a rainbow at twilight. Spanish lace too made an appearance, on a wisp of a black cocktail dress or spliced into knitwear or a vividly patterned pantsuit. Eveningwear came with cascades of ruffles and flounces, in taffeta, tulle, and lace; some of the comparatively refrained numbers, such as a white shell with an intricate motif worn over flowing white trousers, made a quiet power statement while short dresses with rivets and inserts of pilar jacquard played the youth card."}, {"Designer": "Sacai", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "George Clinton, the Parliament Funkadelic founder and style icon, was front row at Chitose Abe\u2019s Sacai show today in a bedazzled cap, jeans, trainers, Sacai T-shirt, and floor-length metallic jacket\u2014dressed down by his standards. While developing her new Spring collection, Abe asked Clinton if she could use the cover of his 1978 album, One Nation Under a Groove. The 78-year-old legend said yes. Message tees have become as fundamental to Sacai shows as Abe\u2019s famous hybrids. They illuminate her tastes\u2014she reads the New York Times and likes Coen brothers movies, judging by her past projects. This season there was an especially pleasing synergy between her P-Funk partner and the collection. Abe was after a sense of harmony\u2014there\u2019s so little of it in the world at the moment. If anything can bring us together it\u2019s Clinton\u2019s famous tune, which played on the soundtrack as he bopped along shooting iPad videos. The Funkadelic record cover T-shirt was one way Abe communicated the sense of unity she wanted. Another was the map print she used for the series of opening and closing looks; the opening in color was more intense than the closing in black and white. These silhouettes had the asymmetry and lightness of scarf dressing; they\u2019d make quite a statement while remaining easy to wear. Elaborating on the idea of harmony, many of the outfits that looked like three separate items\u2014a shirt, pants, and trench, say\u2014were actually jumpsuits. They were feats of patternmaking, but there was less hybridizing here than usual. Abe also experimented with geometric insets. They added new volume to jackets, and circling the leg they produced a flared ruffle hem at the ankle. At many other shows this season, stylists buckled or tied sandal straps on the outside of pants; this felt like part of the same eccentric hem story. Not that Abe\u2019s looking left or right.

After launching his eponymous brand with a show at a tiny downtown New York art gallery in 2016, the Toronto-born designer quickly caught international attention; he scooped LVMH\u2019s prestigious special prize the very same year. Still, running a global fashion house is hardly child\u2019s play. So when Italian leather manufacturer Pellemoda approached him to be the creative director of their in-house brand two-and-a-half years ago, Kruszewski made the decision to put his label on hold. A little older and wiser, Kruszewski is back in the mix this season. He held appointments for his latest collection over the weekend in Paris, his newly adopted city. Judging by the clothes that hung on the rack, this self-taught fashion wunderkind has taken to time to sharpen his design skills. Indeed, his Spring offering is his most sleek and polished yet. The designer has been brushing up on his fashion history lately, too. He discovered the work of Gilbert Adrian via a shared retrospective of the \u201940s couturier and Azzedine Ala\u00efa, who was a longtime Adrian fan and collector. The boxy, oversize silhouette that first defined the look of Vejas was subtly reconfigured under Adrian\u2019s influence, with blazers and jackets that were cut and draped along curvy, decidedly wearable lines. Madame Gr`es\u2019s bewitching dresses were in Kruszewski\u2019s mind\u2019s eye as well. The most classic wardrobe staples, including the LBD and the simple white T-shirt, were gently twisted and turned around the body, a modern echo to her stunning \u201930s goddess designs. The new hand-pleated Vejas frock was finished with leather basket weaving\u2014inspired by a Japanese broom of all things!\u2014and demonstrated an impressive level of craftsmanship. Kruszewski worked with his Brooklyn-based artist friend Louis Fratino to reimagine the idea of the leopard print. Awash with sweet hand-drawn flowers in shades of orange and yellow, the resulting motif was more abstract flora than fauna and worked particularly well on short-sleeved pajama shirts that hung low at the nape of the neck. As a member of Generation Z, Kruszewski understands the importance of transparency in the production process. Though he hesitates to call his brand sustainable, his practices reflect a forward-thinking mindfulness. To cut down on water waste, the new Vejas \u201cjeans\u201d were made from linen; he sourced Lenzing-certified viscose and eco-friendly cupro to line the clothes. There was not a trace of polyester either, which is the fashion industry equivalent of single-use plastic.

It was the American designer\u2019s glory days: Kate Moss and co. were on the runways wearing slip dresses and streamlined black tailoring; studio assistants wore Birkenstocks. \u201cWhen I arrived in New York, I was very much a tomboy, and there was this raw, boyish energy,\u201d Waight Keller said backstage today. Givenchy being a French house, she\u2019s set up her new Spring collection as a conversation between the minimalist New York she remembers circa \u201993\u2014down to the plain white box background of the runway\u2014and the much more exuberant Paris she visited at the time, which was still recovering from the couture excesses of the \u201980s. Waight Keller\u2019s previous collections here have similarly been a dialogue between tailoring and flou. Last season she gave her suits a 1940s gloss. For Spring, the cut of her jackets is slim and elongated, and they\u2019ve been paired with Bermuda-length shorts. It\u2019s somewhat difficult to pinpoint what makes a Givenchy suit a Givenchy suit under Waight Keller, beyond a sense of discipline and rigor. She\u2019s had more success building a vocabulary around her dresses. She likes a lively floral print, silk pliss\u00e9, and a voluminous silhouette. She\u2019s also made black-and-white combos something of a design signature. This season her floral dresses have a covered-up sensibility that reads much more 2020 than early \u201990s\u2014necklines inched up to the chin and skirts tented to the floor. Though it wasn\u2019t all as modest as that sounds. Kaia Gerber wore a blush pink satin bra and a black leather pencil skirt that Calvin Klein might have liked the look of. The collection jumped around quite a bit, and its story lines competed rather than complemented one another, but the most surprising element was all the denim, from short shorts to holey jeans to a V-neck dress made from two different colored washes. The show notes described the jeans\u2019 \u201990s vintage upcycled fabric \u201cpointing to a conscious future.\u201d Waight Keller\u2019s dip into the recent past was prompted by her summertime reading of Allison Yarrow\u2019s book 90s Bitch: Media, Culture, and the Failed Promise of Gender Equality, in which the author argues that the vilification of women like Hillary Clinton, Anita Hill, Marcia Clark, and more at the time laid the groundwork for a sexual predator U.S. president and the current threats to our reproductive freedoms.

Each x Other\u2019s other cofounder, Jenny Mannerheim, was MIA for the best of reasons: maternity leave. The scene wasn\u2019t entirely new to Weiner: She started her career as a backstage photographer for Fashion Week. \u201cThe media, my journey, and my work have brought me to painting, and now Ilan has brought me back to another side of fashion and its ideas,\u201d she offered. A Miami native, she grew up where the sun shone eternally, yet her mother never wavered from her comfort zone\u2014even if that meant turtlenecks (a sartorial signature that family members still marvel at). Her mom was at the show, and yes, she was wearing a turtleneck. \u201cIt\u2019s just the idea of being relentlessly you, whatever you want, whenever you want,\u201d the artist said. Weiner herself grew up body-conscious \u201cas beings do,\u201d and she seized on those memories to collaborate with Each x Other on fluid shapes. For her, it was a manifesto of sorts, an exhortation not to conform to the clothes, but to let the clothes conform to the wearer regardless of size or shape. \u201cInclusivity and fluidity in all senses are important to me. I never think of it in a binary way. I\u2019m a painter, so for me, it\u2019s sort of a lifestyle. I hope that this collection reflects that,\u201d she said. Insofar as the collection touched on her works, that was the case. The Spring Each x Other outing reprised Weiner\u2019s artistic narrative in floral motifs, painterly daubs, and cartoon-like characters. \u201cI wanted it to be very \u2018of now,\u2019\u201d the artist noted. Added Delouis, \u201cWe wanted to create a wardrobe to use as a media.\u201d But the baseline\u2014menswear classics transposed for women\u2014lacked punch. The pitch\u2014a \u201cshared gentlewoman\u2019s wardrobe\u201d of metaphorical canvases to wear as one wished, which Ilan called a \u201ctimeless, ageless, genderless, seasonless aspect\u201d\u2014translated to a crisp blazer, glossy cropped black trousers, or a caramel overcoat in vegan leather, and a striped shirtdress. But the real personality belonged to the artist. Of her brief re-entry into fashion, the artist offered: \u201cI appreciate that my life requires nothing more than my own two hands, which is different from fashion, where there are so many people behind the production.\u201d Perhaps that was the point: This collection is slated for a limited launch in Miami during Art Basel, on October 19th, Weiner will open her first solo show in New York City, and the art pieces are set to be sold online only (with the possible exception of a few artsy pop-ups).

To mark the occasion, he tented a room in the Grand Palais in the Ai\u2019s trapezoidal shape and had a giant Ai created for the back of the runway, from which the models emerged. Naturally, they carried bags, most of them a softly constructed trompe l\u2019oeil update called the Aicon. Kriemler continued the trapezoidal motif with his clothing. Backstage he said, \u201cIt\u2019s good for the physiognomy,\u201d and he was right. Inserted into the backs of dresses, the geometric shapes created a graceful fluidity. Italian painter Antonio Calderara was Kriemler\u2019s reference point for Spring. He chooses a new artist each season, but this one is a particularly apt match. In his late career, Calderara was as obsessed with geometry as Kriemler is today\u2014apparently he was a figurative painter until he saw a Mondrian in the 1950s, after which he never looked back. Calderara\u2019s signature rectangles appeared on a voile shirtdress and caftans as ethereal as his discreet pastel palette. Of the artist\u2019s colors, Kriemler said, \u201cThey scintillate.\u201d That led him to his own silvery palette, which included a silver foil stripe that he developed in St. Gallen, Switzerland, and a metallic Lurex jersey with a liquid cling.

It felt like a long gulp of fresh air and optimism centered on something known. It hit a similar kind of note to that which Jonathan Anderson had sounded at Loewe with his laundered linens. Something of the aesthetics of the Renaissance came through here and there. Even though Piccioli said there was no deliberate religious or historic referencing, the starched bibs, shirt collars, billowing sleeves, and ruffs at times configured as visions of nuns or medieval page boys. Maybe that just happens when you\u2019re an Italian working in Rome. So much white can\u2019t help but draw comparisons with Valentino Garavani\u2019s 1968 All White collection, which was epoch making for the house. But Piccioli is the creator of the second epoch of success that has come around for Valentino\u2014the fashion and his sensitivity to what women of all ages want to wear just keeps flowing effortlessly. In technical terms, Piccioli\u2019s aim for Spring was casualizing the voluminous couture silhouettes he\u2019s established over the past few, staggeringly well-received seasons. He pointed out how he\u2019d removed all the stiffness by translating dresses into light, floppy georgettes, which gave a lovely fluidity to them in delicious one-shot colors: green, absinthe, peach, and plum. His reaching for a more direct form of expression also brought him to jungle prints via the naive vision of 19th-century artist Henri Rousseau\u2014easy to imagine these worn on beaches or boats on some long Mediterranean summer idyll.

After all, the designer comes from Cali, Colombia, known as the capital of salsa. Guests who arrived at the intimate presentation at her chic Paris apartment yesterday evening were greeted by the lovely sounds of a Colombian-Cuban band and waiters preparing drinks dressed in crisp white Cuban shirts. The mood was caf\u00e9 society with a Latin American twist. Ortiz has a great sense for glamour, and this season it was informed by a languid elegance that recalled the 1930s. The frothy ruffles that were once her signature gave way to a more fluid silhouette, with embroidered fringed column dresses, slinky knits in shades of blush pink and golden brown, and tiered Art Deco\u2013style floral-print dresses that were finished with looped braided straps. The same chunky braiding was used to fasten her charming sandals, made in collaboration with Tabitha Simmons. Ortiz is very much inspired by the beauty of her homeland, and for Spring the raffia midi heels took their shape from traditional thatched roofs that trace the tropical landscape. No matter where in the world you are, there\u2019s no avoiding the issue of climate change. And that\u2019s not lost on Ortiz. She incorporated recycled fabrics into her line for the first time, and the textured midi skirts and draped tops in pale pink were some of the strongest pieces in the collection. Even small steps toward sustainability like this are well worth celebrating."}, {"Designer": "Thom Browne", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Thom Browne invited fashion folk to stop and smell the roses this afternoon, with a show set that was straight out of the gardens of Versailles. Conjuring weird and wonderful landscapes is Browne\u2019s strong suit; hence the flowers were a surrealist twist on the real thing, fashioned from classic seersucker cotton. There was a fountain cut from the same cloth in the middle of the runway with a particularly attention-grabbing water feature: its cheeky little cherub appeared to be taking a pee. The American prepster has always offered a wellspring of inspiration for Browne. Each season he manages to splice and dice those unmistakable WASP-y dress codes with his own broad-ranging lexicon of historical and art-world obsessions. For Spring he was drawn towards the unabashed decadence of France before the Revolution. Panniers are easily the most unexpected trend to have surfaced this season, showing up on runways first in London with Matty Bovan, then again in Paris at Loewe, Balenciaga, and in markedly iconoclastic form at Rick Owens. With models in towering wigs and powdered pink faces, Browne\u2019s vision of the 18th-century silhouette aligned most closely with the original. Case in point: Anna Cleveland teetered down the runway in the brand\u2019s new floating seersucker mules wearing a dress that owed its waist-whittling line to traditional corsetry. There was often a layer cake of prettiness underneath the rigorous feminine architecture: petticoats and ruffled bloomers in the softest pastel shades, for example. Browne hardly plays by conventional gender rules from head to toe, however. His signature gray flannel suits were stripped back to their red, white, and blue lining in places, revealing traditional men\u2019s boxer shorts that were buoyed by suspenders. While other designers have made the switch to co-ed runway shows, Browne still presents his menswear and womenswear separately, the old-fashioned way. More often than not though, the two collections are in conversation with each other, as was the case this season. Where Marie Antoinette provided a radical urgency to Browne\u2019s men\u2019s show in Paris this past June, opening up a conversation about gender that has been rumbling through fashion for the last couple of years, her influence failed to have the same political resonance in the context of his women\u2019s offering, especially when you factor in the number of times the ill-fated French queen has been evoked by designers for inspiration in the past. Still, when it comes to pure flights of fancy and exquisite handwork, Browne is hard to beat. In a season that was brimming with alternative bridal options, this collection had several compelling options. The finale dress worn by the gorgeous Alek Wek was a good example, furnished with a cascading bustled train that would look dreamy coming down the aisle."}, {"Designer": "Schiaparelli", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Daniel Roseberry made a memorable debut this July, when he sketched his way through his first Schiaparelli Haute Couture show, completing 30 drawings for 30 exits as the audience looked on. His Ready-to-Wear launch today was similarly dynamic. In the center of the Place Vendome\u2019s Hotel d\u2019\u00c9vreux, he erected a cage shaped like Elsa Schiaparelli\u2019s famous Shocking perfume bottle and stocked it with exotic birds. Flanking the perimeter of the room were larger-than-life totems to the famous designer\u2019s obsessions and Roseberry\u2019s own. One was dripping in gilt costume jewelry (a Schiap legacy), another was stacked with hundreds of vintage My Little Ponies (sourced from eBay and the like, though Roseberry shared a collection with his sister when he was young). Hairdryers, pink flowers, and goldfish bowls with actual goldfish were also represented. \u201cI wanted it to be a tribute,\u201d Roseberry explained. \u201cThere\u2019s this story about Schiap putting seeds in her ears and up her nose. I thought, What if they\u2019d been growing for the last 80 years?\u201d The Ready-to-Wear itself nodded firmly in Schiaparelli\u2019s direction, not in terms of her powerful \u201940s silhouettes\u2014Roseberry preferred a more stripped-down shape\u2014but definitely with regard to her flair for surface details. An aqua blue pantsuit was embroidered with black beads in the shape of ants, while a dress was designed with strategic cutouts to resemble the iconic \u201cTears Dress\u201d Schiaparelli designed with Salvador Dal\u00ed. On the sparer side of Roseberry\u2019s proposal was a tunic-and-pants set in black viscose pliss\u00e9 and a green and black cape dress softly tied at the waist over black trousers. Ready-to-Wear has been an inconsistent element at Schiaparelli since its resuscitation as a haute couture purveyor by Diego Della Valle in 2013. This marks another new start, but it has a clarity about it that gives it an advantage. (A previous iteration was demi-couture, and complicated to shop for.) On the soundtrack this morning, Roseberry read passages from Schiaparelli\u2019s quotable autobiography, Shocking Life. His imagination rivals Schiaparelli\u2019s own.

During a showroom visit, Miller said that a sharp focus on details\u2014texturized fabrics, mixed-media knits, fringe, laser cuts, and burnouts\u2014had resonated with the Joie base, boosting the bottom line and prompting the brand to look farther than its own backyard, literally and figuratively. Hawaiian prints, South American influences, and architecture were just some of the global currents defining the Spring collection. Key looks included higher twists on the white-shirt-with-jeans theme, in a devor\u00e9 fringe paired with \u201970s-redux denims, or a laser-cut eyelet top with acid-wash cropped flares. Everyday \u201cfeminine utilitarian\u201d staples included jumpsuits in navy or floral print, a perfecto-inspired linen jacket, and streamlined cargos with deep patch pockets and a front slit. The brand cast a wide net on dresses with varying results, from a short, flounced chambray dress that skewed a bit girly to a boatneck black and white print that looked on trend and polished. As a California brand, Joie is attuned to sustainability, and to that end Miller said that by this time next year, 75% of its offer would be based on organic, natural fabrics and treatments like silks, cottons, organic dyes, and slub linens, representing a threefold improvement over the recent past. All of which leaves Joie eyeing the prospect of bringing the brand\u2019s aesthetic to Europe and beyond. The wind is at Miller\u2019s back: Joie is striving for more polish, while the world continues to dress down.

He set his Balenciaga Spring collection in a political arena\u2014a faux \u201cBalenciaga parliament or assembly,\u201d which he\u2019d convened to investigate the subject of \u201cpower dressing and fashion uniforms.\u201d So there we sat, in an auditorium Gvasalia had pointedly smothered wall-to-wall in a color not far off the blue of the EU flag, to view his socio-design study of the structure of today\u2019s dress codes. Senior delegates\u2014women and men in tailoring, a severe, anonymous, identically suited corporate presence\u2014opened the show. Who were they? On their breast pockets were embroidered badges, two discs bisected with a Balenciaga logo\u2014a construct not dissimilar to the Mastercard design. Then came what Gvasalia called the campaign dresses. \u201cWe looked at pictures of women politicians, of what they wear campaigning. We took this type of tailored daywear dress and tried to make it cool\u2014not an easy challenge, to be honest,\u201d he said. His solution was to \u201cmake them more boxy and cocoon-y, which is quite Balenciaga. So many body types can wear it. Democratic and easy-to-wear volumes.\u201d All the while a bombastic, pounding, semi-militaristic, horror-movie soundtrack insistently filled the space, mixed by Lo\u00efk Gomez, Gvasalia\u2019s partner. The cast of characters\u2014they were named in the show notes as doctors, lawyers, gallerists, and engineers as well as professional models\u2014kept on coming. The closer you looked, the more you saw the prosthetically augmented jutting cheekbones, the blown-up lips. It was subtly terrifying. Relevance, in Gvasalia\u2019s mind, is equal parts sharp observation of what people wear and a focus on creating something that somehow relates back to the heritage of Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga. That takes us to the crinoline dresses right at the end\u2014almost a child\u2019s cartoon fantasy in their bouncy silhouettes. \u201cBallroom dresses go back to the beginning of Balenciaga, when [Crist\u00f3bal] started in Spain. It was mostly this type of silhouette he did, from Spanish painting,\u201d Gvasalia observed. \u201cBut we wanted to make sure they were wearable. If you take out the crinoline, you have a sort of goth dress.\u201d In the middle, there was a Dynasty-era section, with huge shoulders and the fashion glitz that went with oil-rich couture patrons all those years back. What were their 2020 avatars doing, stalking the corridors of power today? No need to answer that. We felt the fear, we saw the clothes. Some of it\u2014the jersey sport pants, motocross pants, and tailored jackets\u2014looked as if it will jibe with that young generation of male shoppers who are looking for a style upgrade from hoodies. Gvasalia senses the social shifts there too. Asked if he considered this collection to be a paring back of shape and a honing in on reality, he came right back with an answer that resonated beyond his pragmatic design issues (easy clothes to feel powerful in) or the diverse personality casting: \u201cReality?

Unearthing her earlier work inspired the designer to try out something new for Spring 2020, lightening and brightening up her collection. Shot at night in Paris, the look book feels like a sharp pivot away from the urbane, straightforward images Ratabesi usually produces, a stab at something a little more whimsical and free. That spirit continued in the clothing too, with the designer pushing herself to test new colors, fabrics, and silhouettes. Where it was best was where Ratabesi updated her classic pieces. Her popular zip-waist trousers\u2014high-rise, paperboy waist, mid-calf drawstring for cinching or cuffing\u2014were recut in a tech-y lilac silk taffeta that, when paired with a matching anorak, evokes the Y2K sleekness of Prada Sport. Jumpsuits and tab-fastening pants were in rich chocolate twills while Ratabesi\u2019s blouses have evolved to include a button on the mid-arm that allows the wearer to pin up the sleeve for a super-size shoulder. The Face was another #TBT reference on Ratabesi\u2019s mind, which inspired her to explore acidy secondary colors popular in the \u201990s mags\u2019 graphic design. A neon yellow-spliced trench was cool and well-crafted, but it felt out of place in the streamlined wardrobe of Ratabesi\u2019s customer. Ditto for the sexy eveningwear, one of her other specialties, that read a little girlish in silvery lavender colors with organza details. The designer was smart to toughen up these sweeter pieces with lug-soled boots and cool-girl models at the presentation, suggesting that even the most fastidious dresser could find a way to make room for a softer version of themselves in their closet."}, {"Designer": "Melitta Baumeister", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Melitta Baumeister continues to eschew any form of presentation or show even as her line gains traction. She now has a permanent corner at Dover Street Market in New York, and empowered mega-talents like Lauryn Hill and Bj\u00f6rk have taken interest in her designs. On the one hand, she could generate considerable buzz by staging events; on the other, there is something quite special about the appointments that press and buyers get in their place\u2014the calm ambience and the fact that she will try on her own pieces in lieu of a model. For this collection, Baumeister\u2019s fascination with boxing manifested itself very literally as a glove transformed into a shoulder bag and more conceptually as an exploration of padded shapes and muscled bodies. Take the full-length coatdress in technical leather, its couture-like sculpted shape deliberately off-center. When Baumeister demonstrated how the optional padding creates a completely exaggerated shape, it also seemed as though anyone could throw a jab to her shoulder and she would barely feel it. The other statement piece registered as violently pink; and having never previously used sequins, Baumeister applied them to glaring effect. Anyone not intimidated by Comme des Gar\u00e7ons volumes might appreciate the experimentation here. Baumeister also extended her muscle metaphor to the design exercises she gives herself, and you get the sense the hardest thing for her is to think commercially. But looks that integrated linen (she made sure to point out its raw, rather than refined, quality), as well as the coordinated knitwear and technical mesh ensembles, were proof that she is more than capable of softening her approach. If the vinyl jackets remain her best sellers, those in a stiff satin material were best suited to attracting new customers. Among her expanded accessories range, crystal clusters framed with a Cuban link chain give new meaning to heavyweight; and at buyers\u2019 request, Baumeister says she will add a zipper to turn a glove-like belt into a fanny pack.

She\u2019d plotted out the show well in advance, taking the Herm\u00e8s symbolism back to its fundamentals\u2014the aprons worn by the craftspeople at the company\u2019s headquarters in Pantin, France, and its saddlery tradition. Honoring the specialist crafts which still exist in Paris fashion has been a key part of this season\u2019s story\u2014that, and the quest for values which will last longer than passing trends. Herm\u00e8s is in pole position to demonstrate its superior claims on both points. Vanhee-Cybulski\u2019s show, her best yet, provided a confident, modern essay on graphic minimalism with the personal bent that comes from her background as a girl who grew up in the \u201990s.

It gave the designer a structural basis for cutting silhouettes reminiscent of \u201990s tunics over pants and tailored shell tops\u2014the twist being the cross-straps which were curved into the back views, leaving naked skin on show. Lightening and aerating the house leather, Vanhee-Cybulski developed a fine mesh, almost indistinguishable from a techno-fabric, which showed up in semi-sheer cargo pants and was implanted in an ecru denim tunic over shorts. \u201cI\u2019m particularly excited by this\u2014it\u2019s leather backed on organdy!\u201d she exclaimed, pointing out the way rectangular patchworks were placed in a grid on coats and dresses, apparently forming minute gaps in between each section.

Mishra sees a parallel between them\u2014viewed from above, for instance, the buildings we inhabit are not unlike a field of flowers. It\u2019s the type of quasi-fantastical thought that might occur to a child peering out the window of a plane; Mishra\u2019s unwavering sense of wonder is partly what makes his designs so endearing with every collection. This theme of growth also extended to his development of vision and execution. Designs registered with floaty, feathery lightness despite the density of detail.

They\u2019re having a girl! In preparation, Altuzarra has been knitting baby things; his mother and grandmother taught him to knit when he was young and gave him sweaters they had knit themselves. Handcrafts worked their way into his new Spring collection in the form of granny square halter tops layered between button-downs and blazers, or worn solo with midiskirts. Impending fatherhood has also found Altuzarra thinking about heirlooms: Which pieces are cherished most? And what gets handed down through the generations? Remembering the sweaters that were knit for him, he said, \u201cThey defied disposability because they had so much emotion; they were made by hand.\u201d That stream of thought produced dresses patchworked from striped silk tie fabric with a substantial hand, others, collages from polka-dot silk scarves and reinterpretations of Barbour coats in red linen or a cinnamon-color suede. The future hand-me-down as a concept has become a refrain this season. Designers are looking to the past to determine what\u2019ll be valuable in the future. This can produce anachronisms; certain collections have looked almost suspended in time. Altuzarra\u2019s felt fresh and contemporary. That\u2019s down to the vibrant color palette and his confident all-American sportswear. Tailoring formed the foundation of the collection. It took its cues, as many have this season, from the lean silhouettes of the 1970s. Single-button blazers with extra-wide lapels topped high-waisted flares or shorts that split the distance between Bermudas and culottes. Some of the suits were styled without tops, which has become another (somewhat puzzling) theme this season. Off the runway, Altuzarra\u2019s customers will pair them with one of his striped poplin shirts. On the accessories front, the new Cuff bag has a traditional shape with clever magnetic hardware that pinches it closed, but the would-be heirloom is the new crochet version of his popular espadrille-sole bag."}, {"Designer": "Alexis Mabille", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Ever since Alexis Mabille shifted his ready-to-wear strategy by proposing his dressier looks during the pre-collections and dialing down the drama for the main seasons, he seems to have found the focus that eluded him for some time.

Certainly, for many of us, a trench coat\u2013inspired full skirt or a fitted gown with sprays of plumetis hardly qualifies as everyday attire. But Mabille knows his clients, and knows to leave the denim and streetwear to others. What factors into his designs are considerations of a privileged sort: whether a maxi skirt will fold up into a suitcase (instead of needing to be sent by airmail) and how to give a mermaid gown a fun new twist (make it in a stretchy brocade used for swimsuits). The designer says he often works with retailers, both physical boutiques and online, to modify the pieces precisely to their requests. But he also conceives many pieces as multifunctional so that his well-heeled women can style them as they wish\u2014see the elongated perfecto that does double duty as a dress and a dress with a removable striped plastron. And then there were pieces such as a shirtdress bordered in beautiful broderie anglaise that will require no effort aside from the right shoe. When Mabille talks about his materials and silhouettes, he uses the language of an old guard couturier, which counts for something today when so many designers are more proficient as stylists.

The first was a more or less regular double-breasted classic, with wide, extended sleeves. Then he got going with 3-D collaging, scissoring the makings of a raincoat into a full-skirted maxi dress, a pinafore, nipped-waist tailored jackets, a kilt, a pencil skirt, a miniskirt suit, a cape, trousers, parka variants, and a ball gown. Midway, he removed the front sections of coats, and some men\u2019s tailored jackets, and began fusing them onto shirts and white T-shirts. Was it a bravura demonstration of Watanabe as a master of conceptual deconstruction? Well, yes\u2014he is that\u2014but also, no.

I was born to be poetic!\u201d It\u2019s a description that gets tossed around a little too liberally in the context of clothes; yet Yamamoto has spent nearly 40 years constructing and deconstructing with nuanced intensity and beautiful abstraction. True, there were oversize chapeaux reminiscent of museum portraits; wire hemlines on dresses and skirts that curled around as though suspended mid-gust; looks that appeared eccentrically stitched together from old slips and bedsheets; and patterns of cut-outs that deserved to be psychoanalyzed. But to the extent that the feisty septuagenarian usually indulges his dark Baudelairian tendencies, the sum of these impressively executed parts actually felt less profoundly melancholic, more palpably enchanting. This came through in the seductive bias cut and drape of certain otherwise minimalist dresses, and the maximalist monochromatic embroideries that turned the final looks into couture-like creations. And Yamamoto\u2019s creative impulses were in full effect; see the two tangled-volume looks whereby the models\u2019 bodies were engulfed in a riot of rainbow doodles, or else the gorgeous game of geometry he played against the skin so that loosely strung shapes created Cubist breaks within his typical black tailoring (note also the foamy blocks protruding from shoulders). For all the experiments in artful exposure these past few weeks, this grouping of coats and dresses would make a fantastic statement for any art fair\u2013related event. Hats with brims that zipped away or were shaped like single-size umbrellas and sneakers with staggered striped soles transferred these Surrealist whims to more accessible accessories. Of course, the oft-repeated irony with Yamamoto is his expression through clothes cannot be adequately expressed with words. But those who have attended show after show regardless of his perceived relevance\u2014and let\u2019s just say he\u2019s been attracting an increasingly cachet crowd once again (as he should)\u2014can attest that he still finds new and inspiring ways to speak his idiosyncratic language.

This Celine collection was home territory for the designer, and he systematically focused on making a wardrobe, bootcut jean by bootcut jean, blazer by blazer, pleated silk dress by culotte by aviator sunglass and hippy jacket. For Spring, Slimane took the theme back to circa 1974, when Celine was a destination store for the discreet French bourgeoisie, selling such things as silk separates, horse-bit-decorated bags and shoes. All of these were present and correct, expanded into a repertoire which touched streetwear at one level, and glittering gold lam\u00e9 and embroidered dresses at the other. The point is that Parisian girls were the envy of the world, with all their nonchalance and undone hair, and their ability to tie a scarf.

The other way he got at his Paris theme was to take a typically French silhouette like the skirt suit and give it the Lutz treatment. There were two here cut in floral jacquard; on top were baseball jackets, cut blouson style over equally full skirts. The hybridized outerwear that\u2019s become such an important part of Huelle\u2019s repertoire didn\u2019t necessarily jibe with the nostalgia of the rest of the collection, but it\u2019s hard to let go of your biggest sellers.

From her Marais showroom, Bui noted how Cuba and Costa Rica loosely informed her embrace of lively color and pattern while a \u201990s mood motivated many of the silhouettes. By adding Bianca Jagger and Linda Evangelista to the mix as muses, her composite of so-called \u201cexotic\u201d and city chic took shape in several wearable ways.

And that acid green\u2014Bui called it absinthe\u2014is the type of polarizing hue that is either adored or abhorred. Here, the determining factor might come down to dosage. A gilet crested with ostrich feathers was kooky yet cool; an all-over satiny biker outfit with ostrich features cascading down the sleeves seemed like the kind of potential fashion crime that some music artist would commit with pride. Among the men\u2019s pieces, a patchwork bandana top and a sweater covered in extra-large sequins were extroverted without being absurd.

And as far as travel pieces go, the new ruched jersey dresses hit the spot and could be thrown into a suitcase and worn on repeat without too much fuss."}, {"Designer": "Loewe", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Ethereal, poetic, and aristocratic were three words Jonathan Anderson used to describe his Loewe Spring collection, and he wasn\u2019t exaggerating. From his first look out, a white lace tunic with a ruff collar over matching trousers, the visual accumulation of the exquisitely refined, minutely crafted clothes that followed was almost incalculably overwhelming. For once that whole set of fashion clich\u00e9s truly applies: It was stunning, uplifting, incredible to watch. Anderson has already succeeded in putting craft and handwork at the heart of Loewe\u2014his intuition that people would respond to the touch of a human hand in the digital age has proven spot-on. This time, he moved it onto a different plane, away from the earthy vernacular of the homemade and into the realms of \u201ca different kind of craft, which is ultimately historical,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked at the 16th and 17th centuries, where the craft was in the tiniest thing . . . where you had to rely on precision.\u201d Techniques of lace-making and fine embroidery that a modern audience might associate only with antique treasures and museum portraits were brought to life in layers of pristine transparency. It tested the eye and the vocabulary to capture what was being seen: Chantilly, guipure, and marguerite lace; drawn threadwork; sprigged voile shapes; and memories evoking christenings, weddings, chemises, nightdresses, and the laundered and starched household linens of the past. But not \u201cof the past\u201d at all. The real genius of Anderson is how subtly he embeds his references in a wardrobe that is wholly designed for today. Romance and escapism are all very well in theory, but when fashion brinks on costume, it will only ever live in fashion pictures. Anderson\u2019s ambition for Loewe is far more applied than that\u2014he\u2019s a born merchandiser who wants his clothes to be bought and worn. The maximalism of the quality is streamlined into gracefully minimalist fit-and-flare shape, the silhouette he\u2019s stamped on the house. \u201cI thought: Keep the silhouette and expand on it,\u201d he said. Profits are pouring into the bottom line because of that. And another thing to notice: Anderson is a brilliant practitioner of subliminal brand messaging. Loewe is a Spanish house, and that doesn\u2019t just register in the stream of desirable and functional fine leather bags he continually tools for the label. The aristocratic Spanish-ness was right there too, even in the headline-grabbing pannier-hip dresses he sent out in this show. Think about it; it\u2019s a shape that reverberates with Spanish cultural significance\u2014with Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s 1656 Las Meninas portrait of the Spanish royal family. All his revivals of lace and linen fit into that context too\u2014the marvelous fabrics depicted in the paintings of Goya and Zurbar\u00e1n and the golden age of Spain, which line the galleries of the Prado in Madrid, Loewe\u2019s home city. The class of contemporary art-world customers who Anderson has magnetized to Loewe will doubtless appreciate that signaling. This collection was an intelligent tour de force on every level. And as high flown and beautiful as it is, Anderson is determined that it will be delivered in every detail."}, {"Designer": "Dundas", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Peter Dundas is certainly not a minimalist: You won\u2019t find demure black dresses or bourgeois checkered blazers worn with pussy-bow blouses and pleated mid-calf skirts in his repertoire. He likes a sexy, bold look\u2014exuberant and glamorous as it can be. He also likes a good party and actually shares the fun-loving, jet-setting life his posse of young aficionados favors. Like them, he\u2019s constantly on the move. During a recent relocation, he found an old Guy Bourdin book, which he unsurprisingly found inspiring. No one was able to glamorize \u201980s louche atmospheres like the French photographer. His stylish images were coated with a veneer of provocative polish and soaked in saturated, alluring colors. Bourdin\u2019s bold, electric palette of chlorophyll green, fuchsia, cobalt blue, and blackberry energized the usually languid \u201970s-inspired Dundas silhouettes, which were kept more streamlined and less flouncy than usual. \u201cI come from a school where a well-cut jacket is the wardrobe\u2019s foundation,\u201d explained Dundas. Actually, tailoring was one of the collection\u2019s best parts, with strong-shouldered blazers elongating into dresses or worn over matching shorts in abbreviated and boxy versions; a double-breasted jacket and front-pleated cropped pants were cut from gold-laminated, python-printed faux leather and paired with a sexy eco-leather bustier: \u201cThere\u2019s mindfulness in all the madness,\u201d joked the designer, referring to the attention he\u2019s paying to the use of more sustainable fabrics. The play on \u201980s-inspired, short, draped, and boldly body-con silhouettes contrasted nicely with the sensuous, tropical bohemian feel that is the designer\u2019s trademark. A feast of opulent golden floral jacquards and fil coup\u00e9s graced off-the-shoulder, tiered, billowy long dresses, cinched at the waist with laced leather corset belts and open in the front to reveal sexy micro-shorts; mini-dresses with ruffles galore in gold-flecked motifs had an artistic vibe. Independent designers have to carve out a niche for themselves, establishing a clear-cut, unique aesthetic to make them stand out in the crowded fashion marketplace. Dundas\u2019s choice to go solo has so far proved successful: His style appeals to women who are not afraid to powerfully flaunt their seductive side\u2014and the body that goes with it. There are plenty out there, as Dundas\u2019s club definitely seems to have no shortage of membership requests."}, {"Designer": "Isabel Marant", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "No matter the weather, the fantasy of a permanent vacation is never too far away at Isabel Marant. Though rain clouds hovered over her show tonight, the vibe of the new collection was especially hot, with denim short shorts that were cheeky in every sense. It\u2019s a leggy look that\u2019s been rapidly gaining traction in Paris this week, starting with Saint Laurent. And when you consider that France experienced record high temperatures this past summer, with not one but two heat waves, it\u2019s not especially surprising. Marant seemed to be summoning a style-savvy festival girl for Spring, at least in the silhouette. That said, the details were a lot more considered than anything you\u2019d find at Coachella\u2014for one thing, her shorts had artfully scalloped edges. The designer knows her way around a good festival boot, and her slouchy Southwestern pairs were a no-brainer, though it would be hard to imagine revelers teetering around on her classic stiletto-heel sandals all day, even if the ankle bracelets that adorned them had a universal appeal. Marant has perfected the art of the slouchy denim pant, formerly known as the boyfriend jean. With an extra-long inseam, the new, slightly flared style was a nice evolution of the classic peg leg she\u2019s been working for a while. What\u2019s more, it looked just as good on the boys as it did the girls. Marant has cultivated an eternal youthful spirit at her brand, though this season she proved there\u2019s no age limit on that aesthetic. In addition to bombshell Irina Shayk and runway vet Amber Valletta, 46-year-old \u201990s supermodel Eva Herzigova made an appearance in one of Marant\u2019s sexy deep-V jumpsuits (and not a Wonderbra in sight!). Models Elsa Hosk and Jourdan Dunn could barely contain their excitement as they cheered from the front row. Still, nobody rocks the look better than Marant herself. She came out to take a bow with her silvery hair swept into a neat bun, dressed in slim gray jeans and a puff-sleeve beige denim jacket, forever the coolest French girl in the room."}, {"Designer": "Sandro", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "This was la Parisienne de Sandro enriched with relatively subtle Indian-sourced motifs. The press release put it poorly\u2014\u201cShe plays with the bourgeois conventions of the past with a colonial flavor\u201d\u2014but the clothes were much more inoffensive than the rhetoric. Yes, there was a finely cut khaki jumpsuit shown with a paisley neckerchief, but in the absence of a pith helmet and swagger stick, this looked more East Hampton than East India Company. Denim shirting and skirts were puckered with metal-set beading, perhaps a vague translation of Rajasthan embellishment. There was a ruffle top in violent fuchsia, saffron blouses, and embroidered shirts in rich ochre. Sundresses and blouses were presented in an adapted tree-of-life print, and attractively washed paisley shirting in a cotton-metal blend. Much here was reliably Sandro in its sharp-eyed updates of perennial French Girl classics. These included a handsome pleated trench coat, marini\u00e8re tank tops shown against sleeve-tied shiny black leather pants, some Chanel-style coats that played boucl\u00e9 against denim, and a new half-bucket bag named Olga."}, {"Designer": "Jenny Packham", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Jenny Packham has spent a lot of time in Paris over the years. In her apartment, there is now a showroom that caters to brides-to-be and other women looking to dress for special events. It overlooks the British embassy, and she has come to know the place, its history, and its staff. Thanks to one butler, she even got to delve deep into the history of Pauline Bonaparte, aka Princess Borghese, who once lived here. Beautiful and frivolous, she was known to have strings of lovers, and adored causing a stir\u2014a golden cup in the shape of a breast is one relic\u2014and her decorative flair remains. During a showroom visit\u2014a brief touchdown between visiting clients in China, Turkey, and Houston\u2014Packham observed that the harder the headlines, the more people want to let loose and go all out for special occasions. \u201cPeople are more experimental at the moment. Hopefully, we got that party vibe,\u201d Packham offered during a showroom visit, half-jokingly describing her process as \u201can investment and a gamble.\u201d Indeed, many pieces looked like a party in their own right: A feather-trimmed dress in pale blue sequins comes to mind, as do a few numbers in the season\u2019s key colors of rose-petal pink and mint green. Crystal and fringe lent swing to a tiered gown and shimmy to the white bodice of a black-skirted bustier gown. A shower of gold sequins with an integrated cape made another gown look like an Oscar nominee\u2019s dream date. Requests are surging for special cocktailwear, and pieces in fully embroidered stretch crepe are proving a hit: This month, Packham will unveil an exclusive capsule collection on Net-a-Porter. \u201cThere\u2019s an intimacy with the customer that\u2019s almost like it was when we started 30 years ago,\u201d the designer noted. Today\u2019s younger customer may be wildly different from her mother, but sticking to a niche, not to mention being willing to spend half her life on an airplane, is probably why Jenny Packham makes the new generation of actresses, royals, brides, and fans feel so at home."}, {"Designer": "Ann Demeulemeester", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "What do Ann Demeulemeester and Dolly Parton have in common?

A few months back, Meunier caught the American singer Lingua Ignota\u2014n\u00e9e Kristin Hayter\u2014in concert in Antwerp. The designer described her cover of the Parton classic \u201cJolene\u201d as a kind of a bolt from the blue: He knew he had the music baseline for his Spring collection. \u201cThis woman is Jolene,\u201d the designer said backstage, referring to the song\u2019s lyrics about a femme fatale. For her part, Ignota canceled a concert to attend the show. Demeulemeester fans will follow the brand to the ends of the earth. This season, that meant a hulled-out civil engineering building on the southernmost hem of Paris with, a spokesman whispered, seven underground levels for nuclear data storage. The many who made the trek were rewarded with an unexpected take on Demeulemeester\u2019s signature aesthetic, one that Meunier described as more in his own image\u2014slicker, sleeker, grittier, and certainly glossier than the wispy, wistful romance of recent women\u2019s collections. Not that the Spring collection was without nostalgia: The mostly black and white lineup blended punk with references to the years Meunier spent cutting his teeth at Jean Colonna and Maison Martin Margiela in the \u201990s, spliced with signatures from Demeulemeester\u2019s own heyday. To wit: a re-edition, 25 years on, of her classic cut-out, \u201cbird claw\u201d boots, their curved heels newly elongated to 10 centimeters thanks to tech borrowed from the automobile industry. That footwear was the foil for what Meunier described as \u201calmost animal\u201d cuts that curved high on the thigh, with layers of cut-out panels buttoned, perforated, or intermittently stitched together to highlight the body in movement. Razor-cut vinyl bandeaux, with or without a train; coats as glossy as an oil slick, and fishnet or lace camisoles layered with tank dresses added up to a look Meunier described as \u201cenigmatic and more dangerous.\u201d \u201cTrench coats and shirts open up in surprising places,\u201d the show notes specified, laying out a studied counterpoint to the romance of Meunier\u2019s much-praised men\u2019s collection for Spring.

A former competitive swimmer and a beach person at heart (small wonder Aalto is a wave-themed brand), he nonetheless shifted slightly away from the overt, occasionally over-thought expressions of \u201cwave\u201d motifs seen in recent seasons. Instead, he came up with a more conceptual angle based on marine life that might have made Jacques Cousteau smile. A sun hat reprised the shape of a stingray, with twin tails streaming down in the back; a white trench and officer collars were meant to be a feminine spin on the adventuresome Corto Maltese. Merikoski also said he was exploring the notion of movement by extrapolating from a long-standing obsession with the Dutch artist Theo Jansen\u2019s kinetic Strandbeest. The overall impression, however, was that this season marks something of a sea change for Aalto. Like many of his peers, Merikoski has had it with street and is focusing on tailoring, to winning effect on that trench, and with mixed results in terms of oversize volumes. Carrot-shaped trousers with a strap system at the ankles looked rather elaborate. Fine knits had a pretty wave-like texture to them. A tartan ensemble done entirely in sequins represented completely new territory for this designer. \u201cUnfinished\u201d prints and twisted fabrics were part of the story too, with T-shirt dresses simply knotted in front. Washed-out denims floated around the legs or reprised the \u201cwave\u201d idea with a swell below the knee, while a new logo squiggled in the manner of rigging. Speaking of which, for Spring, Aalto has also done a capsule with Voilerie Jeandot, which upcycles used sails into handmade bags. The Finnish clog, too, got dressed up with a bow. In the past four years, Aalto has managed to establish an identity; now with new investors onboard, the brand is shaping a fresh strategy. Paring things back felt like a smart way to start a new tack."}, {"Designer": "Rick Owens", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Rick Owens has lately made headlines for his celebration of Larry LeGaspi, a designer whose name is little known but whose influence was vast, having helped the American rock band Kiss codify their signature costumes, face makeup, and menace. A major Kiss fan, Owens devoted his Fall men\u2019s and women\u2019s collections to LeGaspi and published a book on him with Rizzoli. He signed copies at a postshow party at his Palais Royal store. On the runway, though, he honored another influence on his life: his 87-year-old Mexican immigrant mother. Owens was raised in the United States, lives in France, and manufactures his clothes in Italy. \u201cThat all wouldn\u2019t work without open borders,\u201d he said, alluding to the fight in the States over a border wall with its southern neighbor. But in place of the aggression that\u2019s accompanied some of Owens collections in the past, the ambience he conjured at this show was sweet and affectionate. Men and women in black robes arrayed themselves around the perimeter of the Palais de Tokyo\u2019s shallow pool and let loose a flotilla of bubbles \u201clike something out of Disney\u2019s Fantasia,\u201d as Owens\u2019s models did their perambulations. As for those models? They looked like otherworldly goddesses in their towering platform boots and their Aztec-by-way-of-Fritz-Lang\u2019s-Metropolis headgear. If you cared to, you could read in Owens\u2019s fantastic vision a pointed criticism of President Trump, who\u2019s called Mexicans \u201canimals\u201d and \u201ccriminals,\u201d and worse. The Metropolis reference is no coincidence. Lang\u2019s antiauthoritarian masterpiece depicts a grim underworld peopled by mistreated workers, i.e. the migrant farmers and other undocumented immigrants who do the hard labor that keeps America\u2019s upper classes fed. But take the political gloss out of the story and this was still one of the most captivating collections of the week\u2014if not the season. Who else has magicked a vocabulary, from the exaggerated shoulders of jackets to the tabard skirts to the strange protrusions jutting from pelvises, as sui generis as Owens has? Marine Serre, Christelle Kocher, Kerby Jean-Raymond, and the Vaquera kids were in the crowd today. They caught a real beauty. Owens worked his glam sculptural silhouettes in hot pink, gold, ruby red, and an iridescent chain mail. The collection felt lit from within. And there were honest-to-goodness gowns\u2014surely a first here\u2014in cotton pliss\u00e9 with side panniers. In Disney fairy tales good conquers evil. Owens is too sophisticated a thinker to believe in absolutes, but, damn, he makes a fabulous princess dress."}, {"Designer": "Manish Arora", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Switching from the runway to a presentation format did nothing to alleviate the scrum at Manish Arora, who this season showed at the hall of mirrors inside the Passage Jouffroy, a stunning mid-19th-century brasserie turned salon within one of Paris\u2019s most-beloved covered passageways. The ensuing traffic jam was a head-turner for tourists and locals alike. Inside, guests were greeted by a cabaret-style walk through Arora\u2019s \u201cSmiley World\u201d: the performer and model Luc Bruyere\u2014a ringer for a young Mick Jagger in a patched, embroidered denim vest and long pink skirt with mirror embroidery\u2014sang a balladic cover of the Sister Sledge classic \u201cWe Are Family\u201d while standing on a rotating podium. Groupings of models\u2014an LGBTQAI \u201carmy of dreamers that defy dogma and definition,\u201d the show notes explained\u2014twirled, leaned, and posed, gazing coolly down at visitors who leaned in to inspect pieces such as a skirt that took three or four embroiderers about 30 days to make, Arora reckoned. The rare opportunity for a close-up was a clever social media strategy; it also made this reporter wonder if, in Arora\u2019s case, a Paris runway is really necessary after all. The designer pointed out that the LGBTQ community was celebrating the one-year anniversary of the Indian Supreme Court\u2019s decision to strike down section 377, thereby decriminalizing homosexual relationships there. \u201cFinally, we are all one, in India too,\u201d he said. \u201cTo commemorate that, we wanted to bring together our family of very special people and friends from all over.\u201d Even before the doors opened, Instagram sensation Ryan Burke had put in a day\u2019s work, having risen at 1 a.m. to do his makeup (his pastel feather headpiece, too, was his own design). \u201cI feel in full form because I love wearing this level of makeup, and I rarely get to wear this level of clothing to go with it,\u201d he offered. Intensely embroidered outfits in butterfly colors are Arora\u2019s version of office girls\u2019 attire, for example, a color flow of a sequined suit modeled by Dragoness Lola von Flame, the alter-ego of fellow fashion designer Laurent Mercier; or perhaps a tangerine skirt done in colorful mandalas and gold trim. The moment also offered an opportunity to reprise favorite archival silhouettes and mix those with \u201call things bright and beautiful\u201d including metallic gold corsets, outsize bows, and new iterations of the sweatshirts Arora\u2019s fans can\u2019t get enough of, plus an extra helping of fringe. All this muchness was also a teaser of sorts: By year\u2019s end, Arora will open his first store in India, in Delhi. Then, in 2021, he will stage a 30th-anniversary presentation at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts."}, {"Designer": "Y/Project", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like the Belle Epoque on acid!\u201d said Y/Project\u2019s Glenn Martens with a laugh, as he crouched down to make perfect the hem of a striped rib-knit polo dress, the collar pulled hither and thither, a dress which, like so much of what he does, reveled in the off-kilter and the out of the ordinary. He was, however, actually talking about the music for his Spring 2020 show, an at-first classic then heavily manipulated version of Johann Strauss\u2019s \u201cThe Blue Danube,\u201d which reverberated around his show venue, the cavernous underbelly of the fabled Pont Alexandre III bridge, built in the dying years of the 19th century. The soundtrack switched from orchestral stateliness before gradually fast-forwarding to an ear-popping blur that was by the end of the show pure industrial noise. Martens could just as easily have been talking about the clothes, however. He is a virtuoso of keeping rhythm and then breaking step, and Spring was no exception. Fifty-two looks sped by that had just as many ideas, and plenty more for good measure. Many of them did that neat time-jumping thing Martens does so well: the 1890s black satin evening dress, the bustle now transplanted to the plunging d\u00e9collet\u00e9; the 1930s lingerie boudoir slip, buttons slithering down on the bias, with lace\u2014a recurring motif here\u2014trimming the bust; and the heavenly pure Sargent-esque scarlet velvet dress, with a bodice of shot taffeta spilling over the neckline, as if struggling to escape the confines of all that hourglass, breathe-in silhouette. These layers of history were brought sharply into relevance for today by Martens giving them a jab and punch which denuded them of being purely historicist. There\u2019s nothing costumey about his centuries-spanning cherry-picking. And much of that lies in the way he is able to bring a strong female sexuality to the fore, freeing and empowering where once all was repression and control. Of course, movie obsessives will know that that Viennese waltz from Martens\u2019s soundtrack was also put to spectacular use in director Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey. And as in that film, Martens also gave us glimpses of the future\u2014well, to next spring, at least. There were plenty of shorts, which have been omnipresent in Paris these past few days, like the denim pair with an intricately worked fold-and-drape waistband, while others were worn with a billowing nylon taffeta windcheater or an oversize jean jacket. In fact, there were plenty of pieces here that artfully contorted the everyday into something magical, be it the oversize trench over raw-edge seam jeans or a terrific black satin belted pantsuit over a blue cotton shirt. Because whatever Martens does with the past, everything always leads to the present."}, {"Designer": "Martin Grant", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Next to his desk in his studio, Martin Grant keeps a meticulously curated bulletin board of glamorous swans, Lee Radziwill first among them.

Indeed, the shirtdress is now one of the designer\u2019s signatures, and for Spring he neatly dovetails that staple with the workwear trend, making it about as sophisticated as it can be in blue-gray denim linen\u2014so he shook things up a little by pairing it with bubblegum pink crystal-studded pumps. Speaking of pink, the designer also grows peonies on his Paris balcony, which was perhaps the inspiration for putting his current favorite nonbasic basic color, pollen yellow, with pink to striking effect on a yellow silk jersey top under a textured pink iteration of his workhorse single-breasted jacket, or on an exaggerated lavaliere blouse under that jacket in denim. The pink trench in coated linen with white trim was one of the strongest pieces in this collection. Grant\u2019s discreet manner is lined with sly humor, so he couldn\u2019t resist a detour onto Barbie\u2019s turf: a short sleeveless body-con number, for example.

Today\u2019s collection was entitled \u201cThe Summer of Love,\u201d and it riffed (very loosely) on the kids of 1968. As Moratti noted: \u201cThat generation helped make the world a better place, fighting for human rights, racial equality, and reproductive rights, and against the war in Vietnam. There is a big parallel between then and now. But what we are seeing in New York is different, too, the call to action is coming from the younger generation. I think they are our only hope, and they are right. We don\u2019t have a plan B, so we have to change now.\u201d So, what has Moratti changed? This was his third year of using only vegan, biodegradable \u201cleather.\u201d Plus, the cotton was organic, the denim was recycled, the lycra was made from reclaimed fishing net, and the silk was, he said, certified to have considerably less negative environmental impact than \u201cnormal\u201d silk. What hadn\u2019t changed was Moratti\u2019s unabashedly Roberto Cavalli 2.0 aesthetic. This time around it came tempered with wide-kick flares in \u201cleather\u201d or washed denim, and soft paisley shirting belted and pussy-bowed with men\u2019s ties. There was a military-style shirt jacket with gold frogging and a gold sequin-dripping star at the shoulder. For Redemption, these were relatively pared-down and blissed-out pieces in keeping with the soundtrack of Richie Havens, The Rolling Stones, Jefferson Airplane, and Buffalo Springfield. Elsewhere, it was business as usual with plenty of floating diaphanous animalia, tiger-zebra-mash-up striped jacquard hot pants and shirting, and a wide selection of white or black jersey dresses made to wind around the body as suggestively as possible. There were casualties: one trip (nicely recovered) thanks to a soft floral-printed, long-at-the-front, full-and-ruffled-at-the-back white skirt, while one of those jersey dresses in black lacked the heft to contain a breast. As we watched, we heard the great Buffalo Springfield lyric: \u201cNobody\u2019s right if everybody\u2019s wrong / Young people speaking their minds / Are getting so much resistance from behind.\u201d Backstage, Moratti had been proposed this notion: Should we not just shut down fashion altogether for the sake of the environment and today\u2019s young people speaking their minds? \u201cWell, I could say something controversial and say yes\u2014which is something I believe in my actions and how I dress\u2014but I also say no.

It is something of the spirit of that era that Dossena is seeking to endorse with relevance at a time when a new generation feels dystopia is more like their lived reality.

His concentrated grip on constructing a modern wardrobe refracted glistening fantasy, flower-power prints, \u201970s patchworks and rock-star tailoring through the prism of an intelligent eye for what women\u2014and now men\u2014really want to wear. Anyone can make up a retro look from vintage references and call it a collection, but Dossena isn\u2019t one of those. The innovation puts him in a different class\u2014like the way he cut long, medieval trumpet sleeves into a tiny pink-and-black lace outfit with fluted shorts. Or the way he broke down a silver lozenge-formation chain mail look into a camisole, top, and skirt\u2014a direct homage to Paco Rabanne\u2014but put it over a red polo shirt. Many of the looks that made such a fashion impact were separates; in other words, pieces that are easy to take away and integrate into people\u2019s wardrobes. That goes for the puffed-sleeve lam\u00e9 blouses and the skirts, and even for all the neat, mod pants suits (based on templates pioneered by Fran\u00e7oise Hardy and Prince). In today\u2019s fashion system, the hammering home of single ideas by dint of repetition has increasingly become a marketing ploy. Dossena doesn\u2019t do that. His collection had its star standout pieces\u2014the patchworked leather \u201970s Deco-pop jackets with rising sun and cosmic planet motifs were headline-makers that rank as some of the season\u2019s most eye-catching. But beneath that, there was a complexity of ideas that credits people with a freedom of choice about how to put themselves together. Maybe it was a bit like that in the \u201970s, but it\u2019s a rare distinction in a designer in this day and age."}, {"Designer": "Atlein", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "On October 7, Extinction Rebellion will once again be active in Paris, and those taking part in the protest will include the Atlein designer Antonin Tron, who has quietly been a member of the environmental protest group since the end of last year. I say \u201cquietly\u201d because he\u2019s been loath to say too much about his involvement for fear of being labeled an eco-designer, or for Atlein to be dubbed a sustainable brand, though in some ways both are true; for Spring 2020\u2014a collection of gorgeous, grown-up, and chic (yay, bringing chic back!) clothes\u2014Tron was able to use 60 percent deadstock fabrics that he\u2019d sourced from mills and factories across Italy. (And in another right-minded effort, he designed a tee bearing the image of a white-cheeked gibbon; 20 percent of the sales will go to fund Extinction Rebellion.) Still, Tron has a point: It\u2019s amazing (and, okay, not wholly surprising) how quickly the green tag has become a marketing tool to engage the Insta-generation, a corporatized initiative to somehow speak to fashion\u2019s place in the very real and frightening future we are heading into. While some of the biggest global behemoths have been engaging with how they can play their part, mindful of both the environmental challenges and cultural shifts we are going through, the reality is all too apparent: How does anyone in fashion square away their participation in the industry, an industry built on the perpetual thrill of the new, at the very moment when consuming more, more, more is the very last thing any of us should be doing? It\u2019s something Tron has been trying to reconcile ever since he was moved to sign up with Extinction Rebellion; reconciling his creative impulses with his own unwavering commitment to real action on climate change. And he has arrived at a kind of militant peace (if you can call it that) with himself, where he can bring together being someone who makes clothes of value that are designed to last and last, and someone who isn\u2019t prepared to eschew his political stance. \u201cThe answer, I realized, isn\u2019t in the big things,\u201d Tron said backstage just before his show, \u201cbut in the small.\u201d For \u201csmall,\u201d read: \u201cconcise\u201d (he\u2019d whittled down the show to 31 looks), \u201clocal\u201d (he has chosen to make most of his clothes in his native France, with technicians and craftspeople who\u2019ve been making things the same way for years), and \u201cpersonal.\u201d Ever since he launched Atlein, in 2016, it\u2019s obvious he has been intimately engaged with the draping, cutting, and manipulating of (usually) jersey, which is a very him fabric; it yields to the body of its wearer with ease, but it needs a lot of dedicated and delicate handling of the technical challenges it presents to get it there. Tron is a thoughtful designer, a problem solver in pursuit of beauty. Any one of the terrific sinuous black dresses that he showed more than ably demonstrated his ability to work with the fall and flow of the material, highlighted perhaps by bias-cut panels of a pastoral floral print, or planes of fabric folded over and embellished with a row of gold snaps. They were so good, it\u2019s hard to think of those as small, so ambitious and perfect were they in their execution."}, {"Designer": "Zadig & Voltaire", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Kate Moss presided over the Zadig & Voltaire show today.

For Fall the designer had worked with upcycled yarns, but wanting to explore how she could create even more responsibly, she went into her storeroom and pulled out bolts and bolts of fabrics and trims from all different seasons\u2014old, new, Spring, Fall\u2014and laid them out on a table and just let the magic happen. Or as Tam put it, \u201cI let the universe dictate to me what is good for this season.\u201d The joy Tam found in the unexpected mixing and matching of archival fabrics and new, of texture and colors, and pattern clashes too, was evident in the patchworked pieces she assembled for Spring. There was a new lightness here, and one that wasn\u2019t tied to a narrative but that grew out of the materials. Dotting the i, as it were, of a snazzy blazer made of maybe four different fabrics were denim-patch pockets. The mash-up approach also lent unexpected charm to the designer\u2019s iterations on the modest femininity of that Little Women look that\u2019s come back around.

Taking the concept further, this season Zobel partnered with Instituto E, a Brazilian non-profit working to transform its country\u2019s production practices. The organization supplied the collection\u2019s Pirarucu fish skin, which Zobel used as a leather substitute. The fish is a staple of the local diet in the Amazon region, but its skin is typically discarded. This too is an admirable project, only the Pirarucu isn\u2019t going to win any beauty contests.

There was a fair amount of Swarovski bulleted brocade and silk, but what Dell\u2019Acqua did pare down, to a degree and in the context of this brand, was fussy ornament: The only truly zhooshily furnished garments were a black shirt and dress set in metal pins and beads connected by silver thread to look beautifully like a randomly assembled circuit board. There was also a lot of color contrast that created an appealing visual friction, from Burberry circa 2013 arguments of metal-sheened color on a blue coat, red skirt, and green shirt to the unctuously smooth interaction of a draped leather top in caramel and pleated skirt in red (both deeply wearable leather pieces some \u201cleather\u201d houses should study). The fabrics were lovely and often precious, but never prissy: Jaggedly Fortuny pleated wet-finish velvet dresses in orange and black, and an apparently luggage-crushed crinkled olive pussy-bowed tent of a dress were exemplary of Dell\u2019Acqua\u2019s high-profile, low maintenance philosophy.

As the notes put it: \u201cThis collection is dedicated to these liberated girls and boys who, for a few 500 franc notes, contributed to the splendour of France.\u201d As he explained backstage, Ren\u00e9 was inspired by Emmanuelle director Just Jaeckin\u2019s 1977 movie, Madame Claude. This Serge Gainsbourg\u2013soundtracked \u201cthriller politico-\u00e9rothique\u201d (thanks, French wiki) was based on the real-life door-to-door Bible salesperson turned procurer of sin Madame Claude, real name Fernande Grudet, who (according to Vanity Fair, no less) counted John F.

Ren\u00e9 discussed the sense of freedom and sexiness he saw in the period and said he was particularly taken by a scene in which Claude, played by in-the-audience Fran\u00e7oise Fabian, walked into some snooty boutique (it might have been a Laroche boutique, but my French could not quite keep up with his) looking devastating. Walking on a vintage Guy Laroche\u2013logo carpet, some of the looks at first were enticing enough. Ren\u00e9 mixed suede and jersey in skirted pantsuits, tobacco rompers, and an elegantly fluid white-collared jersey dress. Even some of the logomania pieces had a nuttily burnished luster to them, although they did bunch unfortunately at crotches of both genders.

It wasn\u2019t supposed to be either. Instead, this was a collection in which you considered subtleties: the full billowing back of a white poplin shirt and a black shirtdress; the slick sheen of cycling shorts against the slubby roughness of the linen cowl coat worn over it; and the gathering at each hip on what looked like a lab coat in pale blue. Quite clever and fresh-looking was a sort of front-facing martingale on some semitailored women\u2019s jackets.

The discovery of the surprise collaboration (worked on for months but secret till the reveal) was enough to send fashion fanatics into a frenzy.

Call it anything you like, really, but for all those millennials who have reverentially studied Lacroix\u2019s every landmark pouf, bow, and clashing haute couture fantasia and cursed the injustice that they were born too late to have ever seen a show of his, it was an impossible dream materializing before their very eyes. So there they were\u2014just because Van Noten found Lacroix\u2019s contact and asked\u2014working out how a sort of modern, casualized, couture-like collection could appeal to the Dries Van Noten faithful. It involved color and zebra print, flouncy flamenco skirts, bubbling sleeves, polka dots, fuchsia, rich brocade, and taffeta trains spilling off the runway\u2014all Christian Lacroix\u2019s talent for abundance. It also involved Van Noten\u2019s eye for an essential core of believable wearability.

In truth Van Noten can\u2019t be typified as a dour northern minimalist\u2014he\u2019s always been known for his decorated coats, and gold bullion embroidery is a specialty of his house. Here the gold was dulled to look almost like pieces of authentic vintage costumes, sometimes with Lacroix\u2019s signature jet beading thrown in. Well, we\u2019ll learn more about what went on behind the scenes tomorrow. It\u2019s been exactly a decade since Lacroix, the supernova hero of high-\u201980s haute couture, left fashion and began pursuing the other love of his life, costume design. The exuberance and flamboyance of this one-season collaboration was more than a breath of fresh air\u2014and how smart of Van Noten to intuit that this is a time when apparently extremely different points of view can be brought together to create something beautiful and that will work for a lot of people.

Pinned to the mood board was a printout of Portrait of an Elegant Lady, in which a smiling woman (thought to be dancer and comedienne Marie Justine Beno\u00eete Duronceray) is playing the harpsichord. The ruffles, ruching, and lace in her dress are intricately detailed, and the muted pale blue was lifted into the collection\u2019s palette of dusty lavender, blush, and sapphire. That\u2019s all familiar territory chez Marchesa, as was Drouais\u2019s penchant for gardens. The difference in the blooms here was that they felt a bit more natural\u2014especially the finale gown, a sheer beige \u201cnaked dress\u201d with a tumble of 3D roses piled up at the hem\u2014and there were new experiments in transparency. Dresses printed with hand-painted florals came with tulle overlays in the same motif, just scaled up for added depth. On the opening dress\u2014a pink floral strapless style with smocked tulle around the skirt\u2014the effect was of lightness and whimsy, much like one of those sweet, utterly feminine Rococo paintings."}, {"Designer": "Saint Laurent", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Pillars of white light strafed the night sky from a vast black stadium erected opposite the Eiffel Tower. Somehow, the Saint Laurent show sensation has morphed into something between an open-air city spectacle, a rock concert, and a brand power rally. In the experiential stakes, public visibility of Saint Laurent under Anthony Vaccarello\u2019s creative directorship reaches for miles and miles across the center of Paris; it\u2019s an event that gathers hundreds of onlookers, who sit on the walls opposite to see the models passing by. As a phenomenon, it could fuel any number of case studies about how the exclusionary hierarchies of luxury fashion have fallen and dissolved into irrelevance in today\u2019s digital world. Yet for all that, everything that took place on that runway tonight centered around what Yves Saint Laurent did in the 20th century\u2014his Le Smokings and his hippie deluxe Russian collection\u2014and how Vaccarello systematically retools, rechannels, and reiterates it for a new generation. Amid the automated crossbeams of lights swiveling from the floor, he began with reams of micro shorts and Bermuda cutoff jeans; riffs on tailored jackets; Betty Catroux sunglasses; and slick, funnel-leg Western boots. After nailing that message (a believable one, since all girls have been addicted to tiny shorts this summer), the segue to hippie glam\u2014the style that Yves Saint Laurent elevated from the street in 1976\u2014began with turban-tied Lurex head scarves and then moved into an extended run of gorgeous gold paisley embroidered dresses, tissue-like chiffon blouses, pleated lam\u00e9 skirts, peasant smocks, and off-the-shoulder gathered necklines. For a designer who has often kept to a strict and narrow canon of black, this was a softer, more delicate side to Vaccarello\u2019s sensibility, and one rich with a kind of relatable, easy romanticism that young women haven\u2019t been offered recently. But then, there was even more. After a dramatic pause, lights down, came the Saint Laurent payoff: all the tuxedo suits, led by Stella Tennant and closed out by Naomi Campbell. Message? This is timeless Saint Laurent, not just for the leggy and skinny in their clubbing years but for all generations."}, {"Designer": "Koch\u00e9", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "A couple of years ago Christelle Kocher took her Pre-Fall Koch\u00e9 collection to New York, staging a show in the city\u2019s famous Strand bookstore. Today, the winner of this year\u2019s ANDAM Prize one-upped herself. She\u2019s the first designer ever to be offered the Centre Pompidou\u2019s Biblioth\u00e8que as a venue. In a backstage interview Kocher recalled studying in the museum\u2019s library while at university. She has always chosen venues and made casting decisions (once uncommon, but increasingly influential) that represent the \u201creal Paris.\u201d That hasn\u2019t changed, but with the ANDAM spotlight on her, Kocher made an effort to sharpen her design message\u2014to say, \u201cI belong in the Paris big time.\u201d Kocher\u2019s high-low aesthetic, which mixes couture detailing with streetwear, has kept her somewhat sidelined from those proverbial big leagues. But as fashion changes and customers start turning against the impersonal high production values of giant corporations in favor of labels with a noticeable human touch, attention is shifting in her direction. In front of her largest crowd yet, those sharpening efforts came through from look one, a neatly tailored trench elaborately embroidered with crystals and wooden beads, and culminated near the finale with a spangly cocktail number, the base of which was soccer jerseys cut into embellished florets linked together by strands of tiny beads. Sustainability has been part of Kocher\u2019s mission from the start. In addition to that knockout party dress, a middle section of patchwork polo dresses and tracksuits was made from upcycled materials (that\u2019s another thing she was early on). But she spent most of her efforts this season on polishing her fancier pieces. There were several dresses constructed from squares of fabric \u00e0 la Madeleine Vionnet, only Vionnet\u2019s were never made with humble cotton. Most impressive were Kocher\u2019s bias-cut numbers, from a shirtdress whose button placket twisted gracefully across the front to a pair of slip dresses with voluminous skirts that looked especially graceful in movement. She\u2019ll be Spring\u2019s go-to designer for a statement hat, too. In the end, the magnificence of the Pompidou space and its narrow sight lines worked a bit to Kocher\u2019s disadvantage. Her embroideries and patchworks reward extended inspection. Still, as the models returned for the finale, each one carrying a different book, it was satisfying to see Kocher getting the attention she merits."}, {"Designer": "Anrealage", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Among other innovations, Renaissance painters resolved issues of perspective: natural horizon lines and foreshortening of feet so that they appeared planted on the ground. For frescoes above eye level, as one example, they would distort the figures so anyone looking up would perceive them realistically. Kunihiko Morinaga came at his latest Anrealage collection as an extended exercise in similar trompe l\u2019oeil; the key difference is that he constructed the clothes instead of painting them. To establish this conceit, he first showed the staples of a preppy wardrobe\u2014navy blazer, chino, argyle vest, et cetera\u2014in three different versions as though being viewed from above, from below, and from the side. Volumes narrowed and widened; pants flared and slimmed down; necklines dipped low and crept up; everything shifted and twisted asymmetrically for the lateral versions. The execution becomes more and more impressive upon noticing that smaller details have been distorted accordingly as well, whether the diamond patterning, the foreshortened tie, and even the buttons and buttonholes that morphed from circles to ellipses. Before the show, Morinaga explained that imagining the clothes from different angles was motivated by the same starting point as last season\u2019s experimentation in scale: that so much of fashion today is discovered through two-dimensional screens instead of seeing something three-dimensionally. Bags, sunglasses, and headphones were nearly as flat as cardboard yet consistent with each perspective. Tone-on-tone shoes and socks did not undergo any changes. Here\u2019s the issue: The sleight of hand required to transform 2D into 3D does not fully translate to images that are once again 2D. Without all the explaining above, some pieces\u2014notably, the pants\u2014would be wearable in the real world, but many of the otherwise clever distortions might be perceived as arbitrarily absurd. Still, those who dare to don the extra-roomy, high-angle blazer or any of the torqued dresses can engage any quizzical glances. \u201cJust imagine you\u2019re looking at me from below,\u201d and see where the conversation goes."}, {"Designer": "Victoria/Tomas", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "As Parisians from elsewhere\u2014she grew up in Moscow; he\u2019s from Latvia; they met at fashion school in Paris; their atelier is in Belleville\u2014Victoria Feldman and Tomas Berzins have a love of place that is perennially inspiring and particularly well traveled.

While the patches looked a bit much, the couple adroitly resisted the temptation of a message T-shirt, offering instead a window with a view.

Today at Christian Dior, which for many marks the beginning of Paris Fashion Week, the jungle became a forest\u2014or perhaps an arbor\u2014but of a strictly transitory stripe. For her Spring 2020 showing for the house, Maria Grazia Chiuri worked with the Paris-based environmental design collective Coloco, whose work regarding green spaces and urban regeneration she finds inspiring when thinking about sustainability. The \u201cshow trees\u201d will soon be planted in projects around the city. And they are not solely European trees, Chiuri was quick to point out, as healthy gardens are, by design, heterogeneous. And so in the center of the Dior runway lay the central analogy for the show: Respect for diversity and nature will set us free. Add to this Chiuri\u2019s other key source of inspiration for the season\u2014Catherine Dior, sister of Christian\u2014and the analogy gains weight and depth. Catherine, the \u201cMiss\u201d of Miss Dior, was a resistance fighter and concentration camp prisoner who emerged from the rubble of World War II to become an acclaimed gardener and botanist. She literally grew her way out of the postwar gloom with roses and wildflowers galore. Seventy years later we are on the verge of environmental disaster, and (horribly) internment camps abound: Ethically, historically, metaphorically, Dior-ifically, Chiuri and Dior are on point. And the clothes? Lovely, utterly lovely . . . gentle and shrewd and worthy of investment. The silhouettes were a hit parade of Chiuri classics: Jackets were boxy, pants slouched from a dropped crotch, dresses (high necklines, long sleeves, winsome transparency) grazed the ankles with a smidgen of volume gathered in the back. And the foot was resolutely grounded: by a perforated hiking boot, a logoed espadrille, an earthy flat. There was a cool men\u2019s shirt in forget-me-not blue to layer under nifty tailoring. There was a small passage of looks in stone gray cotton that provided the chicest nod to utility on the runway in some time (the short boilersuit was adorable). There were bleached denim ombr\u00e9 pieces that consign all the many attempts at acid wash elsewhere to (\u201980s) shame. And then there were endless dresses\u2014printed, appliqu\u00e9d, embroidered, crystal-ed, filigreed\u2014in which lace, raffia, jacquard, silk, and tulle were layered and interwoven to create thoroughly wonderful, artisanal items. The sustainability piece that Chiuri offers at Dior is precious handwork married to real design in ready-to-wear.

For spring, many of her looks were a party in and of themselves, strewn with a confetti of painterly prints, jazzy motifs, and ripples of glassy sequins and ruffles. If it rang a little proto-MTV, there\u2019s a good reason for it: The designer has been listening to a lot of classic New Wave lately, which led her to mull over the granddaddy of New Wave TV series: Miami Vice. \u201cI remembered all the techniques, I started going backwards and thinking about how those videos were made,\u201d March explained, referring to the cop show\u2019s slow-mo, music-heavy style. Flipping that cinematic aesthetic to a women\u2019s wardrobe, in a color palette of mints, pinks, and light blues, she offered up a snap-up, funnel-neck Perfecto in butter-soft Spanish leather, and prints evoking Keith Haring\u2019s graffiti-like signature, most successfully on a liquid blue technical fabric. A tailored seersucker in blue and white Prince of Wales check was a good option for daytime, but the Carmen March base loves the nightlife. To that end, the designer gave them a wealth of options with pumped-up volumes. But the watercolor mint evening gown had such restrained elegance it wouldn\u2019t have looked out of place in the Kennedy White House, an ensemble done back-to-front in d\u00e9vor\u00e9 cotton, and a little black dress embellished with plumes of pink and silver struck just the right note.

The decision makes good business and branding sense, with the hype around menswear only growing. But it also means that to see an Undercover womenswear collection is, in many ways, to revisit ideas the designer has already explored on his men\u2019s runways. For his Spring 2020 womenswear collection, Takahashi pulled directly from the brooding menswear collection he showed in June. Back then, his graphic jacquards and patchwork prints were cut almost entirely as suits and almost entirely in black. For women, he burst his palette and his silhouettes open, using similar techniques to Technicolor ends. In an effort to get away from the graphics he is so known for, especially following a multiseason Valentino collaboration, Takahashi made textural collages on top of his garments using different fabrics in the same color. On a Schiaparelli pink camp shirt, a treelike Virgin Mary presides under a crescent moon. On the back of a slate blazer, a gigantic bat swoops a woman into its claws. A gray cat slinks across a tee, and butterflies swarm a shirt-and-skirt combo. Consider this the fated end to Takahashi\u2019s horror obsessions of late: The symbols of a mysterious, sinister darkness imagined in his own hand, free of reference, built out into three dimensions instead of flat, two-dimensional screen printing. This is the sort of fashion that haunts you in all the right ways. The idea of creating pattern without printing continued in star embroideries, the hybridization of garments, and the transformation of Cindy Sherman\u2019s Untitled Film Stills into denim jacquard pieces. Okay, a few prints did sneak in, but they were of Edward Gorey\u2019s illustrations; essentially catnip for the vampires and glampires who adore Undercover. Worn with exploding tulle skirts, neon lacy bralettes, and girlish heart- and cat-adorned accessories, this was, for a collection not about graphics, instantly graphically covetable. The lookbook images here, partly sapped of color, are a statement of visual subversion, of course. But in taking in these bright images, you couldn\u2019t help but fantasize about the way these clothes would look on a runway. The craftsmanship on display surely warranted it, and in a rainy Paris Fashion Week of tropical prints and happy raffia, we all could have used a fabulous Undercover fright night."}, {"Designer": "Marine Serre", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Marine Serre sent out umbrellas as invitations this season, a boon to Fashion Week commuters in Paris, where the forecast calls for rain over the next eight days. For Serre, such erratic weather patterns are far more than just an inconvenience to guests at her show, held en plein air in the grounds of a racetrack; they\u2019re a reminder that climate change is real. The industry is beginning to wake up to that reality too. Just days after the U.N. Climate Action Summit kicked off in New York this week, Kering announced its entire group would be going carbon neutral, and it\u2019s been almost a month since President Emmanuel Macron unveiled his \u201cFashion Pact\u201d at the G7 summit, a sustainability initiative to which 150 brands have signed on. Serre is part of a new wave of young designers who\u2019ve taken matters into their own hands by quietly and intuitively embedding sustainable values into the seams of their clothes. The title of her latest collection, Mar\u00e9e Noire, means oil spill in English, though the literal translation has an even more ominous ring to it: black tide. The show began at the toll of what sounded like a death knell with a series of slick all-black looks that included recycled plastic raincoats accessorized with reclaimed metal hardware belts, seashells hung on hoop earrings, and reusable water canister holders. Speaking before the show, Serre explained that the collection was conceived as the aftermath of an apocalypse in which only a handful of people have survived devastating climate wars and mass extinction. Though the designer rarely works in black, this season the funereal tones made perfect sense. The opening look, an elegant black moire knee-length bubble skirt paired with a terrific utilitarian zippered jacket-cum-cape lit the way both figuratively and literally, with an infrared light strung around the model\u2019s neck. That passage gave way to an impressive lineup of suiting created with an extreme terrain in mind. Serre\u2019s distinctive logo has quickly become a global calling card, instantly recognizable on her signature second-skin leggings and turtleneck shirts. Reimagined as a tonal paisley print, the distinctive crescent moon brought a rich polish to her expertly cut brown and burgundy coats and slim trousers. They were proof that she can wield the power of tailoring with the same ease as she does branding. Serre recently moved to an expansive new studio in the 19th arrondissement. With the new space, she\u2019s been able to ramp up her commitment to sustainability. Now, 50 percent of her collection is made from upcycled materials, and the remainder is produced locally with fabric sourced from French mills. Fashioned from an exquisite tapestry of vintage crochet table cloths, the lace slips, wool shawls, and ethereal white dresses were a great example, offering an alternative to the idea of luxury that was forward-thinking and thoroughly soulful. Whatever future awaits the fashion world (or the planet in general!), it\u2019s special and considered designs like these that will stand the test of time."}, {"Designer": "Mame Kurogouchi", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Due to scheduling conflicts, family obligations, late flights, and some lost luggage, no Vogue Runway reviewer attended Mame Kurogouchi\u2019s Spring 2020 show. The feeling of awfulness that stemmed from missing the designer\u2019s presentation quickly bloomed into delight upon entering her showroom in Paris. There, she and her team had erected a monument to her craftsmanship and thoughtfulness where, after being offered an espresso and taught a lesson on Japanese jelly candies that relate to specific seasons, she unpackaged a vintage Japanese tome, Tsutsumu: Traditional Japanese Packaging, and walked us through the ins and outs of traditional wrapping that informed this collection. It took almost an hour to learn about the specific traditions, an hour that makes the brevity of her runway show seem almost absurd. For a designer who cares so much about supporting the artistry of her country, her hometown, and her people, how could a 15-minute d\u00e9fil\u00e9 ever do? After inspecting Kurogouchi\u2019s garments up close, I\u2019m assured she is one of the most thoughtful designers on the Paris schedule. First, she is an anthropological artisan above all else, employing factories throughout Japan to use arcane techniques to new ends, like her semi-sheer knits that seem to be two-ply but are actually the product of an ancient tradition from her hometown, Nagano. Second, she can riff on a theme to diverse ends: Spring 2020 was mostly about packaging, silkworms and their cocoons, and flowers, the way things wrapped up or discarded can be beautiful in a moment. That path led her to explore knitwear, ikats, embroideries, suiting, lingerie, and printed frocks, leaving no hemline, seam, graphic, or stitch unconsidered. For some designers, that level of attention to detail\u2014the willingness to spend more than half the week visiting factories\u2014would be a distraction. For Kurogouchi it\u2019s an inspiration. Her clothing, so poignantly thought-out and impressively made, wears easily on the body, including a silk floral dress with bell sleeves or a netlike knit piece that was inspired by a piece of garbage the designer saw on the side of the road. Her ability to translate the cerebral into the covetable is truly impressive.

Delving into the rich history of Turkey, which is her birthplace, she wanted to \u201cchannel Ottoman dandies,\u201d she explained, particularly the cultivated style of Osman Hamdi Bey, a multitalented genius living at the end of the 19th century: A politician, philosopher, painter, and archeologist, he founded the Istanbul Archaeology Museums and the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, and was always impeccably turned out in traditional Turkish garb, with elegant nods to the formal Western style of dressing. Masculine tailoring is often the foundation of Ege\u2019s minimalist design, so it made sense for her to take a cue from the unisex appeal of traditional men\u2019s caftans and sarouels. Tackling the gender-fluid conversation, she gave her spin on rigorous, streamlined construction to the elongated shapes of roomy tunics and drop-crotch loose pants. \u201cMixing heritage and comfort,\u201d she said. To drive home her point, she had the collection\u2019s lookbook shot on a pair of brother and sister models, almost identical in their angelic, androgynous looks. Yet Ege\u2019s approach is deceptively simple; she loves an emphatic volume and, in her hands, even the cleaner shape becomes terse and crisp, almost as if filled with air. There\u2019s also a subtle play on decoration, even if she doesn\u2019t favor embellishments. In the Spring collection, the caftan shape was given as many iterations as possible, equally wearable by a boy or a girl. A classic long version in pearl gray or white was cut from fresh cotton poplin and worn with sarouels and sneakers, while more romantic interpretations had drawstring collars and broderie anglaise appliqu\u00e9d bell sleeves. Voluminous sleeves demanded attention also on an ethereal tunic in virginal white gauze cotton, flourishing with an abundance of ruffles and dainty lace entre deux. Continuing the gender-swapping theme, the guy was assigned a black ankle-grazing pleated skirt with a stiff-collared striped silk blouse, while the girl paired a pair of black sarouels with a masculine oversize shirt. Red and white stripes played also on a silk caftan with a drawstring high waist, a unisex rendition of the nightgown wore by Ottoman aristocrats. Exquisitely finished, with delicate detailing and Italian fabrics of excellent quality, the collection had a feel of clear-cut ease; folk accents were reduced to modern and comfortable shapes, which contrasted with a series of more feminine Japanese doll\u2013inspired concoctions. High-waisted and pouf-shaped, a triumph of organza, broderie anglaise, and various lace appliqu\u00e9s, they suggested the childish charm of paper dolls\u2019 cutout dresses.

Case in point: After discovering that the recycled PET labels she had been using were releasing tiny plastic particles when washed, she promptly switched to linen tags this season. As far as bigger picture inspiration for Spring, Willow began by looking at the cellular structure of plants under a microscope.

The red-lit room flashed white; corrugated metal gates cranked open; and 21 models wearing white straitjackets or variations of emerged from backstage and proceeded slowly across the runway\u2019s moving walkways. Then the lights went out and it was suddenly over. How to read such a startling prelude? As usual, Michele\u2019s elaborate show notes offered a clue: \u201cFashion has a function: to let people walk through fields of possibilities . . . sacralizing every form of diversity, [and] feeding indispensable self-determination skills.\u201d It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that as a designer Michele is among the most influential forces in fashion\u2014if not the most influential force. He\u2019s made maximalists of former minimalists and turned the world on to vintage of all eras, cacophonic color and print, logos, glitter, and gender fluidity most of all. These days Gucci is an adjective and even 11-year-olds recognize the green-red-green stripe when they see it on people in the street (I know; I have an 11-year-old). The resulting rise in Gucci\u2019s fortunes has been nothing short of staggering, but numbers don\u2019t go up forever. And even a look as eclectic as the one Michele formulated for the brand becomes a uniform after a while. How to read those straitjackets, then?

Instead he used graphic color-blocking to add interest to tailoring that evoked the lean lines of the brand\u2019s \u201970s heyday and Tom Ford\u2019s \u201990s reinterpretations of same. The biggest shocker was Michele\u2019s embrace of sexiness. He has typically preferred quirk to kink, but not today. Riding crops (a reference to S&M and to the house\u2019s equestrian heritage) accessorized lace-inset slip dresses, and black vinyl chokers put the finishing touch on scoop-neck leotards and high-slit midi skirts. Tailor labels on the sleeve cuffs and pant hems of those \u201970s-by-way-of-\u201990s suits read Gucci Orgasmique or Gucci Eterotopia. Michele\u2019s got a merchandiser\u2019s gift for the things that grab the eye, like those exposed brand tags. His goal here seemed different; he\u2019s turned his attention from surface details to silhouette. That\u2019s a more ambitious project because it\u2019s more subtle. But if there\u2019s anyone who can convert a generation to a what\u2019s-old-is-new-again brand of elegance, it\u2019s him."}, {"Designer": "Dolce & Gabbana", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "There was no mistaking Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana\u2019s theme this season.

It\u2019s our philosophy.\u201d Over the course of 124 looks, the designers touched on all the elements of their chosen theme and then some, starting with safari suiting (minus the pinup girl patches of their recent men\u2019s collection, which covered the same territory) and cycling through animal and tropical prints, scarf dressing, and resortwear designed for lounging poolside but absolutely too special to actually swim in. The jungle has been a big topic of this Milan season\u2014everyone from Giorgio Armani to Donatella Versace has weighed in. Where Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s collection stands apart is in the extraordinary craftsmanship on display. Apparently the raffia pieces from the June menswear show were so successful with clients they redoubled their efforts here. Crocheted, woven, or embellished with crystals, they were surprisingly soft to the touch, not at all scratchy as might be expected. Just as supple, if not more so, was a crocodile skirtsuit, the pieces of which were constructed like a puzzle or a mosaic with virtually undetectable seams. This was Alta Moda\u2013level stuff. Elsewhere there were Instagram-friendly nods to the now\u2014aspirational stuff for their youngest fans\u2014such as the very tiny bags that accessorized many of the looks and the leopard spots in the shape of Ds and Gs. Interspersed throughout the collection were quite a few little black dresses, a welcome antidote to the excess of jungle references\u2014not that D&G\u2019s clients have anything against excess. \u201cVery DNA,\u201d Gabbana declared of these, and \u201ca little bit \u201990s\u2014our archive.\u201d He came across a vintage Dolce & Gabbana LBD on 1stdibs selling for $8,000 and was stunned. \u201cThis is why we make again black sexy things,\u201d he said.

As chief brand officer Ingo Wilts explained: \u201cThe pattern that runs through the collection was inspired by an early morning walk I took through Hudson Yards early in the summer. The sun was just rising and the colors, especially the blues, were mirrored in all the buildings there.\u201d Being Boss, much of the womenswear and menswear on show today was dedicated to suiting. However Wilts\u2019s decision to show much of it in head-to-toe tonal color and the buoyant bounce of the fabric helped to highlight cuts, especially for men, which seemed sleek and unstuffy. Wilts even made cummerbunds look cool, which is some achievement. In womenswear there was a game of contrasting volumes-wide pants with fitted jackets and vice versa, and plenty of quietly chic touches including folded sash necklines and piping. This brand is very accomplished when it comes to making minimal outerwear, and here there were many overcoats to relish in treated nylon and leather. There was a lot of leather elsewhere, as at many of the shows in Milan this season, and the sight of a scarlet leather hoodie with paracord detailing, an object perfectly attractive but which is highly unlikely to perform at retail, made me think: Has the time has come to declare a voluntary moratorium on performative leather runway pieces? If I had a dollar for all the leather shirts, pants, and shorts I have seen at (especially menswear) fashion shows that almost certainly never go on to be produced, let alone worn...and they seem especially absurd in Spring collections. This is not criticism specific to Boss, however. Wilts talked backstage about the \u201cindividuality of fashion now\u201d and it is to his credit that within the context of such a large corporate concern as Boss\u2014and one so associated with providing corporate attire\u2014he presented many pieces you could imagine appealing to an eclectic range of customers."}, {"Designer": "Agnona", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "A big part of what makes Agnona so very special is its fabrication, the details of which can be challenging to glean when the clothes are whooshing past at speed. Happily, the label\u2019s designer, Simon Holloway, is on hand and willing to dig deep into the granular data. Take the trenchcoat in Look 13: \u201cThat\u2019s in a silk dupioni woven on an antique narrow loom. There are only four of them left, and when a part breaks down, we have to remake it from scratch.\u201d Or the check tailored looks that ran through the midsection of the show: \u201cThese are all in patterns taken from the Agnona archive and made in double-face Century cashmere.\u201d As for the attractive double-breasted, short-sleeve, shirting-reminiscent wrap dress of Look 34: \u201cIt\u2019s a yarn-dyed crepe de Chine in a candy stripe. And the belt is napa wrapped around cork.\u201d These were a few of the ingredients in a collection that saw Holloway zero in on Milan\u2019s golden age intersection of fashion and industrial design, the late \u201970s to early \u201980s. He said: \u201cIt was before everyone became obsessed with shoes and handbags, and fashion was all about daywear, which the Italians did better than anyone else.\u201d His starting point had been a grainy, wide-angle photo of baggy pants\u2013wearing Milanese clustering outside the first Memphis Group exhibition in 1981. This was the source of the pastel color story in the last third or so of a show that followed a first two-thirds as neutral as Switzerland. The attention to period silhouette here was precise in its \u201cimportant\u201d shouldered and low-skirted jackets, but these were also shapes you could imagine working in the world today. Although doubtless mind-meltingly expensive, there was a satisfying sense of roughness in the slubbiness of its silks and the texture of its piqu\u00e9 that contrasted pleasingly with the impeccable leather, voile, and cashmere.

But imagine if we applied it to things, art, food, music, or\u2014God forbid\u2014clothes: that would be horrendous. Liking some stuff and disliking other stuff is both a by-product and definition of individual identity. And knowing and loving stuff by the people you live among is cultural identity.

From this outsider\u2019s perspective, it reflected the full spectrum of a cultural taste that runs from the awe-inspiringly sublime (Renaissance art, cinema, cannoli) to the pretty ridiculous (soulful saxophone house, Temptation Island, Matteo Salvini). It seemed incredible that the same runway could host the eye-straining naffness of a look of hot pink floral silk short shorts tied by scarlet leather cord with a fluoro green sequined sweater, alongside a completely composed white crepe suit cut with Palladian precision. There was an albeit glittery, grungy conviction to a full-skirted, oversize paisley-printed organza dress worn above raised sole-glittered oxfords that seemed incompatible with the beautifully made but showgirl-cheesy dresses in nude lace feathers. We\u2019ve already seen palms this season, of course, but here they were finely expressed, flipped 90 degrees and monochromed on a long silk skirt: It was nice. By contrast, a quilted embroidered parka came in colors best worn to attract intervention.

As spaces go, it was positively monumental. That put a lot of pressure on the clothes, but this collection was as good as Missoni gets. Maybe that\u2019s because it sprung from personal inspiration. Backstage, Angela explained, \u201cWhere I started was this idea of a man and a woman\u2014a couple\u2014exchanging clothes. That couple\u2014who was in my brain from when I was a young teenager\u2014was Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin.

Just suits and dandyish separates for the guys, and for the girls bohemian dresses with the occasional slouched-on shirt or masculine jacket worn over the top. So simple it almost sounds basic, but that\u2019s where the house signature knits come in. Space-dyes, stripes, zigzags, polka dots, crochet, patchwork, ombr\u00e9s\u2014they were all in play. More often than not several came together in one outfit. Layering like this can be intimidating to the uninitiated: Does this go with this? That with that? Missoni said not to overthink it. \u201cI want it to be joyful; I want it to be happy and light\u2014light in weight and light in spirit, and easy in the mix, also.\u201d Some of the models carried crocheted and beaded basket bags as Birkin once did, with flowers cut from Angela\u2019s garden this morning. They were utterly winning. On their finale tours, the models reemerged carrying Little Sun portable solar-powered lamps by Olafur Eliasson. Each time a Little Sun is purchased, according to the website, the social business \u201cdelivers one to someone living off the grid at a much lower, locally affordable price.\u201d Yesterday\u2019s Global Climate Strike didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Angela: \u201cWe cannot strike, we\u2019re all working, so I called Olafur and asked for a thousand lamps so we can be hand-to-hand with the sun, so we can spread the ethos\u201d about climate action.

In an effort to raise awareness about the Kalash and to provide their community with income, Jean collaborated with the Chitral Women\u2019s Handicrafts Center, founded by the 22-year-old Karishma Ali, on her Spring 2020 collection.

According to a press release, it was the first time the embroideries were ever produced for use outside the Kalash community. Jean should be more than proud of her ability to use her fashion for good. Her activism goes far beyond slogan tees and hashtags and actually incites economic and social change. But when it comes to innovating in design, Jean\u2019s collections have become somewhat repetitive.

There was also a section of appealingly textured squidgy handbags. Long, strapless silk dresses were layered over opaque pants with necklaces of cascading woven beads. Another parachute pant, this one smoky gray, was worn with a pale green bow, a ruffle-edge vest, and a necklace of a long, looping metallic cord. The earthiest we got for around 20 looks were the brown accents and the pragmatic wearability of much of it. Then a sleeveless Nehru-collar shirt and long skirt in brown with green abstract foliage curls signaled a shift that led via double-leg black pinafore culottes to an increasingly lush series of diffuse tropical leaf prints, metallic coruscations, and those mineral flourishings played out in tulle scrap scarves and hems.

The intimacy of the venue and the daylight that floods its courtyard served to force us to look again at the work of a designer who has been so scrutinized over the years.

As far as obsessions go, she found a kindred spirit in the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama and her immersive polka-dotted universe. Battaglia further hybridized the look with full-on doses of Carmen Miranda\u2013esque frills, flounces, and ruches, lavished on the calypso sleeves of crop tops matching high-waist bell-bottoms or on long, billowy, A-line, off-the shoulder dresses. In the designer\u2019s vision of elegance, going total look is the ultimate option, so she coordinated almost every piece with matching foulards, sunglasses, bags, platforms, and cute slippers from her newly launched shoe line.

At this presentation, held in a stylized imagining of a Swiss house, he mentioned an excellent Bally initiative this year to remove around a ton of rubbish from the upper reaches of Mount Everest. He added that the company is working hard to pivot its operations to ensure they are, from base to peak, environmentally irreproachable, but conceded that it is a work in progress. That there were only 10 looks for each gender presented here was also to infer a leaner, more resource-conscious outlook from this venerable brand. Yet Girotto admitted that, of course, much more was on offer behind the scenes. And when I visited Bally in June, the then-commercial-facing showroom was packed to the rafters with much, much more menswear merchandise than was on display this week. Many of Milan\u2019s most successful fashion executives live just across the Swiss border in Lugano. This is apparently solely for tax reasons, but if Bally\u2019s vision of a typical Swiss house is accurate, perhaps there\u2019s more to it. Models lolled around on sofas, mattresses, or even reclined on banks of mussed grass in an appealingly textured clapboard structure (which reps assured was all to be recycled and reused). For women stand-out garments included a long black dress in irregular, diagonally pitched panels of silk and lace, whose slant reflected the line of the kitten heel worn with it, as well as some typically sharp suiting. (Bally is really excellent at this.) For men there was a lovely zippered compartment jacket in ombr\u00e9-textured orange leather, an Alpine-print double-faced shirt, and some substantial double-faced khaki pants.

Shapes for him are defined by an elaborate, almost cerebral take on fabrications, whose manufacturing process, often handcrafted, he personally oversees. The Spring collection read as another chapter in his very personal narrative; the starting point was a photographic printing process called lumen, where an image is created on sensitive paper exposed to sunlight. The outcome is hard to control, abstract, and often has a pictorial, poetic quality. Colangelo tried to capture these mutating, unpredictable visuals, working on a \u201cdistorted color palette,\u201d as he called it\u2014ombr\u00e9 dyes, faint floral shadows, diluted shades of watercolor transparency. Textures were also approached with the same mind-set\u2014think: warped laser-cut leather strips woven into nets, then knotted on elongated cady tunics. Or else jacquard fabrics with inserts of elastic fibers \u201ccreating an imbalance,\u201d as the designer put it. While the work on textures was extremely complex and technically challenging, shapes were wisely kept simple, following Colangelo\u2019s penchant for a modernist, pared-down aesthetic. Tunic dresses, overcoats, and soft-tailored pantsuits were loose and roomy, with plays of geometric cuts and contrasting inserts giving lightness. Colangelo is a skilled, experienced designer; his work is complex and subtle, so much so that it could go undetected. To fully appreciate his craft, you have to look at it closely.

As it marked the 10-year anniversary of the label, Spring 2020 was a collection Giorgetti has been gestating for six months, stripping away the kitschy excess and honing in on his brand DNA. For the first time, he said backstage, he worked without an inspiration, instead reflecting on the best of his decade in fashion. What that meant on the runway was a varied and exciting lineup of ruffles, colors, and quirk. Things started off with the designer\u2019s pastel tweeds, subverted from their prim connotations with blooming bows and awkward, boxy silhouettes. Then he segued into frilly little knits with a homespun feel worn over transparent chiffon frocks and pieces printed with artwork by Todd Bienvenu. The pieces shoppers will go wild for came later: Lady Di blouses with gigantic ruffles that jutted over the shoulders and revealed an exposed back; worn with bike shorts and bobby socks, the tops felt instantly covetable. The same silhouette translated into watercolor florals and belted frocks with an Yves Saint Laurent spirit. If these irreverent pieces were Giorgetti hitting his stride, his lace suiting and asymmetrical fringe felt like slight falters. Although maybe it\u2019s all about context. His show was the first to be held in the Triennale\u2019s Giorgio de Chirico space, set among the Surrealist sculptor\u2019s Bagni Misteriosi works.

But for Spring 2020, his fourth runway for this Italian heritage brand, he thought he\u2019d give the Vara a go. Andrew\u2019s interpretation, which has been dubbed the Viva, has a pointier toe and a longer vamp. He paired them with ankle-length socks, which lent the looks they were worn with a youthful esprit. The Vara isn\u2019t the only house icon Andrew considered for Spring. Ferragamo funded the recent rehabbing of Florence\u2019s Neptune Fountain\u2014Fendi did the same for the Trevi in Rome, and Tod\u2019s CEO Diego Della Valle has supported the refurbishment of the Colosseum. Andrew took photographs of the fountain\u2019s famous marble statue and re-created them as a print for overalls and camp shirts and as a velvet d\u00e9vor\u00e9 motif on a summery dress (for men they made their debut at Ferragamo\u2019s Pitti Uomo show in Florence\u2019s Piazza della Signoria). Why not capitalize on the company\u2019s good works? In any case, the Neptune motif jibed with the general direction of the season. Inspired by a photo of himself and his brother as young boys on holiday, Andrew wanted to conjure the laid-back spirit of summertime in Italy. One way he did that was to resurrect Ferragamo\u2019s swim collection, which had been dormant for about a decade. Elsewhere he tried to get at the feeling with construction: Dresses were bubble-skirted, and the back was cut away on sweaters and coats to create lightness. Leather is the Ferragamo patrimony, but there was perhaps too much of it to maintain the intended effervescent mood; even cut paper-thin and away from the body, the material isn\u2019t ideal for the heat. A straightforward jumpsuit in khaki or black and a breezy striped caftan that played to Andrew\u2019s minimalist strengths were naturally better suited for summer travel. Their spareness made a fine canvas for the soft-structured tote and accordion clutch that accessorized them.

So many people went hunting for that green dress, and a still nascent Google was so ill-equipped to handle the traffic, Google Images was born. It was a boon for the company, and the implications for Versace and co. were mega. You could argue it was the end of fashion as an insular industry and the start of fashion as entertainment. At a press conference before her show today, Donatella said, \u201cWe all follow technology; it\u2019s at the center of our lives today, but 20 years ago it wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m proud that we inspired Google Images.\u201d Her new Spring collection celebrated the milestone. Versace brought the jungle prints and Google provided the Tilt Brush technology that created the digital art projections playing on the walls of the makeshift Pantheon built for the occasion\u2014and Lopez is what made it all click. After the final model made her circle, pictures of J.Lo in the iconic number scrolled by on the walls, then Donatella said, \u201cOkay, Google, now show me the real jungle dress,\u201d and out Lopez glided in an even more naked version than the original, as bronzed, buff, and gorgeous as ever. Needless to say, it was mere minutes before she was a trending topic and the new dress was near the top of a Jennifer Lopez Google Image search. On the runway the energy couldn\u2019t have been higher. The crowd was on its feet for a better view\u2014and a better camera angle\u2014the moment she made her entrance. The surprise guest factor energized Donatella. This was the sharpest and sexiest she\u2019s gone in some time. It was definitely less merchandised than last season\u2019s outing, and in that sense it felt quite late \u201990s. Go back and look at the original jungle-print show and what strikes you is how streamlined and unaccessorized the overall aesthetic is. There are other similarities. Though the prints were the ostensible story then and now\u2014after all, prints are what register in images on a screen (that\u2019s one small way technology has changed fashion; there\u2019s plenty more)\u2014the designer didn\u2019t ignore black in either case.

Interestingly, a particular kind of \u201990s sexinesss\u2014heavy on the black and the stilettos\u2014is trending in Milan. With this collection, Donatella confirmed that she has a more vital claim to the era than just about anybody.

The municipality had never before granted permission to hold a fashion show there; the designer was rightfully quite proud. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of doing a monochromatic collection for a long time,\u201d said De Vincenzo, known for his eclectic textural work and experimental medley of color and pattern combinations. \u201cWhat I had in mind was a sort of human rainbow, and here I am, with 47 models, who in sequence will give life to a diluted, stretched rainbow wave.\u201d Each model sported a monochromatic look, going through the entire spectrum from black to pink. This reduced approach forced De Vincenzo to focus on texture, giving a more interesting depth to surfaces without reverting to prints, patterns, or other pyrotechnics. As he is a conceptually risk-taking designer, the challenge was clearly enticing. De Vincenzo indulged his penchant for elaborate textural work; fabrics were waffled, pleated, fringed, or waved, in a plethora of kinetic solutions and tridimensional, expressive juxtapositions. \u201cLook at this classic silk cady, one of the flattest, less exciting fabrics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was pliss\u00e9-d, twisted, lasered, and embossed, and now it looks like an ice cream.\u201d To bring home his point, De Vincenzo had models walking along the docks carrying ice cream cones matching the color of their dresses. The gesture looked a bit preposterous, distracting from the intricate construction of the outfits and the outstanding work on textures. Each outfit was unique, spanning from body-con silhouettes to hourglass shapes to billowy volumes. If at times the styling felt a bit overdone (and the glittery, chunky, high-heel platforms made it hard for the models to negotiate the long catwalk), the designer kept the rhythm interesting, with a variety of graphic, feminine shapes. \u201cThis show is about differences and diversity,\u201d said De Vincenzo. \u201cFashion speaks to every woman; I want to speak to every woman. No discrimination. Who is the woman who buys my clothes? Sometimes it\u2019s just unexpected\u2014perhaps it\u2019s a woman I would have never imagined would like what I do.

Behind the iron gate of the historic Palazzo Berri-Meregalli, Molly Molloy, Kristin Forss, and Lucinda Chambers are building Colville into one of those labels. The trio has insider credibility to spare\u2014having worked together at Marni\u2014and style too. Chambers was Consuelo Castiglioni\u2019s longtime stylist, and she\u2019s fashion-famous for her eclectic layering and innate sense of cool. But there\u2019s more than that working in their favor. Without all the resources of a giant conglomerate behind them, Molloy, Forss, and Chambers are resourceful in their approach to things. They work collaboratively with a Colombian women\u2019s group on charming woven bags, and they\u2019re sourcing vintage silk scarves and old shell jackets from the \u201990s and turning them into graceful dresses and clever sleeved shrugs respectively. Social responsibility and upcycling are buzzwords that fashion companies use to rationalize the hyper-production of endless stuff. But this isn\u2019t marketing speak at Colville. It\u2019s built into its collective way of doing things. Molloy, Forss, and Chambers are really, truly close to the product. Customers can feel that. And for that product, it\u2019s not anonymous. There\u2019s a sleeveless jacket whose tailoring registers as classic, but their trousers are distinctive: high-waisted and belted. Hailing as they do from Marni, the Colville trio has a flair for bold floral prints and off-kilter silhouettes, like an upside-down shirt whose sleeves drape below the hips and a trompe l\u2019oeil skirt that looks like a folded-over dress. No one else is doing raincoats made from boat sails; they call them their \u201ccrisps package\u201d coats. And those upcycled scarf dresses and shell jackets-turned-shrugs are one of a kinds. They\u2019ve also done a small collection of jewelry.

To celebrate the relocation, Ravizza staged a series of delightful tableaux vivants, with a live piano playing in the background. In the Spring collection, leather took pride of place; maxi trenchcoats in soft black napa with patent leather inserts had a \u201970s feel; classic biker jackets were given a romantic twist, worn with tiered maxi skirts in dark animalier-printed organza. The same feminine approach graced long, billowy organza dresses, which nicely contrasted with black sharp-cut tailored blazers worn over see-through tulle-net skirts to sexy effect. Fur was reduced to discreet details; Ravizza opted for ponyskin or shaved lambskin mimicking astrakhan as an eco-friendly alternative for a bathrobe-inspired belted trench. It was a vibrant, energizing shade of flame red, part of a reduced color palette that included black, white, and silver. Focusing on easy yet modern leather pieces was a smart choice for Ravizza.

Bravo to a major Italian house for putting sustainability front and center! And kudos to Risso for showing a collection that had charm and beauty by the bucketload and upcycled textiles, organic cottons, and \u201crecuperated\u201d leathers. He wanted to create a \u201cjoyous protest\u201d\u2014\u201can homage to nature and our sense of humanity\u201d\u2014and he succeeded. Risso loves metaphors, and he often starts his collection from a rather abstract narrative place. This collection began with him imagining a tropical disease\u2014ergo the jungle setting\u2014that leaves its victims hallucinatory, dizzy, trepidatious, or succumbing to a \u201cbeautiful vertigo\u201d (\u201cthe WTF of this particular and hard moment\u201d). He wanted to create looks that cause \u201cecstatic sensations\u201d and \u201cnice shivers.\u201d He wanted, essentially, to make fashion that gets under your skin. The results are deeply romantic: balloon-smock tops paired with fit-and-flare skirts from which ruffled petticoats spill. Some are in lustrous satins, raw edged and weighty in the best way. Others are in prints of deliberately naive, semi-fauvist paintings done by Risso and his team in the studio. The colors are bold\u2014green ivy and wicked magenta, say. The silhouettes are conservative (long of line, neo-Edwardian, or \u201950s couture) but slashed and exploded. Many of the pieces are aprons (masquerading as dresses) paired with full skirts. Sweaters hang asymmetrically. It is territory shared in the fashion landscape by Junya Watanabe, Raf Simons, and Molly Goddard, but it\u2019s totally Risso and so right for Marni.

The cut and vibe of both these items were perfection: pristine but easy, patterned but somehow neutral. There wasn\u2019t an editor in the room, male or female, who didn\u2019t sit under the thought bubble \u201cI want to be that girl.\u201d The finale was Veronica Etro at her best\u2014old-world, bohemian, cultured, and feminist. And her conviction that the shirt is due for a return (\u201cwe are all full of tee shirts\u201d) was the best part of this collection. There were two shirts that ruled the catwalk today: one, a classic men\u2019s piece with sharp cuffs and a shirttail hem; two, a massive blouse in dotted swiss or cotton lace, piratical and romantic in the extreme. Both were positioned as wardrobe essentials for a groovy vixen who alights in a paisley, animalia-themed hot air balloon (there were three on the runway) to follow dudes in bands to gigs the world over. Yes, this was a collection devoted to festival girls\u2014groupies, actually\u2014but only the great ones (Birkin, Pallenberg, Rampling, Bissett), those leggy British beauties who, in the \u201960s, floated effortlessly between Pune and Tangier, Formentera and Monterey. This is not unfamiliar territory in fashion, of course, but it is a historical landscape that Etro has some claim to. Haute hippie heritage chic is basically the DNA of the house. And they do all the basics of this look well: ruffly, floaty dresses in mini and maxi lengths; intricate Silk Road\u2013like vests and boleros; kimono-esque robes and wicked obis; velvet jackets, just because; pirate boots and gladiator sandals festooned with metal butterflies. This season the news was the shirts, tailoring in general (which included an elegant and seasonless three-piece suit in brocade), and the sweaters, which were multi-textural, appliqu\u00e9d, and fringed. The knitted coats were extraordinary, actually: artisanal in the extreme and all the more collectible for it. Toss one over a tailored suit for extra warmth on a brisk summer night, and you would always feel chic and original. Toss one over a stripy shirt and paisley jeans, and you would feel like the luckiest girl alive. Now all you need is a ride in a balloon to the Isle of Wight.

The seaside was the theme, though it wasn\u2019t a first-degree interpretation; there was nothing so obvious as marini\u00e8re stripes, for instance. Instead Grazia Malagoli and her team started with the concept of sails: their triangular shapes and the ropes used to manipulate them. The approach made for some very appealing summer dresses\u2014wrapped, asymmetrical, and breezy. A few were accented with leather collars, cuffs, or harnesses\u2014Malagoli described them as leather bijoux. These worked best when they played a minor role. A shoulder-covering harness counteracted the inherent ease of the swingy trapeze dress it accessorized. Absent marini\u00e8re stripes, Malagoli and company turned to other codes of the sea. A leather peacoat with poncho-like proportions opened the show, and later there was a sun-bleached blue fisherman\u2019s sweater and a loose interpretation of navy dress whites minus the insignia. Applying the seasonal theme to Sportmax\u2019s sartorial DNA, shorts replaced pants as an accompaniment to jackets, and in some cases, jackets were subtly deconstructed to enhance their sense of movement.

Light leather outerwear obviously played a prominent part: Au courant sporty bombers were given a sleek feel and paired with elongated culottes; slightly oversize dusters and overcoats in bonded leather or anaconda looked easy and unfussy. Slim day dresses had asymmetrical napa inserts and plays on pleats enhancing the movement, while fine, soft-tailored pantsuits retained a sharp-cut \u201990s feel.

She expanded on her tentlike shapes, some with pleats, others with ruffles, and also tried out some new materials and flourishes, like Sangallo lace (printed, of course), paillettes, and feathers.

It felt like a gesture conveying a subtle message\u2014a desire to keep the noise of the outside world at bay, allowing space to focus on the convictions, ideas, and beliefs that truly matter. Despite her delicate, patrician looks, the designer certainly has conviction to spare. Plan C, the young label she launched three seasons ago, is growing steadily and fast. \u201cBut not too fast,\u201d said her father, Gianni Castiglioni, who invested in his daughter\u2019s collections after exiting Marni together with wife Consuelo. \u201cWe pay close attention to production and distribution, picking the right partners and growing organically,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a savvy strategy for a niche label, which allows Carolina to pursue her own vision while carving a space in the marketplace. It\u2019s a luxury not many young designers can afford today. Carolina might benefit from the family fashion expertise, but the look is her own. \u201cI design only what I like to wear,\u201d she said firmly. The staples of Plan C style are clearly defined: a flair for sportswear and workwear revisited with an artsy touch and Milanese practicality; a penchant for clear construction and vintage utilitarian shapes, smoothed by an off-kilter, almost awkward sense of romance. This season, the oversize volumes that in previous collections felt a bit overblown and challenging were toned down; the silhouette was controlled yet more feminine, with plays on pliss\u00e9, fringe, and glossy finishes creating a sense of movement. Floral prints were wallpaper-y and exuberant, gracing maxi jumpsuits and billowy organza tiered dresses and worn under military-inspired belted jackets in Japanese canvas and trenchcoats with detachable color-blocked life jackets. The tomboyish attitude Carolina favors was tempered by a vibrant color palette of jade green, emerald green, and sunflower yellow. Small niche labels are what keep today\u2019s fashion landscape lively and creative. Their points of difference energize the industry, bringing the conversation forward while appealing to customers looking for something unique.

Tordini was taken with the notion of these vaguely illicit, highly art-directed, and deeply romantic spaces, because, although the Milanese love a nightspot, theirs are rarely so discreet. And so today, over a decade later, Tordini and Gilda Ambrosio, her partner in Attico, created one of their own. They took over a labyrinthian Chinese restaurant, filled it with chaise longues, wild tropical blooms, velvet cushions, lanterns galore, and an amusing cast of actors and performers, and created a clever and convincing backdrop for their Spring/Summer offerings for Attico. When you make clothes for the club, why not make the club as well? Tordini and Ambrosio are, first and foremost, storytellers. Each season they begin with a narrative that is entirely their own, and then they give their protagonist a wardrobe. This season they began with a working girl, an office-bound creature, someone who trudges the corridors of power by day in a strong-shouldered blazer and microskirt of opulent jacquard or crisp cotton, and tossing on a trench, chandelier earrings, cocktail rings, and some big sunglasses when the clock strikes six. She might wear a simple tee under the jacket; she might swap the thigh-high skirt for an \u201980s-influenced baggy trouser. Her shoes could be a kitten-heeled boot, a nifty slide, or a sandal secured by skinny cords tipped with Swarovski crystal balls. . . . Yes, disco balls, because as hard as they tried to imagine the Attico woman at the office, the designers knew almost immediately that this was a lost cause. The Attico woman marches out of the office, whispers a code word to a bouncer, and finds her way to the dance floor in a New York minute. In the Uber en route, she will swap the tee for a feathered bra top, or pull on a strapless brocade micro-frock with a plumage sprouting beguilingly from the right breast. Her pants are now zebra-striped, as are her boots, and her torso is cloaked in lavender maribou. If she\u2019s really lucky, she\u2019ll figure out a way to shimmy into a flapper-ish mini with ombr\u00e9 crystal fringe on the front and retro kinky lingerie finishings on the back\u2014sounds complicated yet looks effortless and hot, coming and going. The big-shouldered jackets are there to get one safely home at night (she needn\u2019t borrow his when hers is so much better). Most of the clothes are sequined and feathered and built for a certain type of fun and a certain type of girl. Attico continues to tell the story of that sort of girl more convincingly than their peers in fashion, mostly because it is theirs alone to tell because it comes from a highly personal place.

The project was a long time in development (Margherita was appointed last October), so a low-key launch was not what she had in mind. Picking up on the trend of fashion experiences, she booked a sidewalk caf\u00e9; hired hip-hop dancers; stocked a newsstand with branded M Missoni T-shirts, scarves, and macram\u00e9 iPhone pouches; and took us all on a tram ride around the center of Milan. At each stop, more M Missoni\u2013clad models hopped on. It was an eclectic bunch, 70-some people of all ages, colors, and sizes cast from the street, along with friends of the family, such as Bianca Brandolini d\u2019Adda, Elisa Sednaoui, and Jessica Hart. By the end of the ride, it was a regular M Missoni clown car, stuffed to bursting with an energetic, playful mix of space-dye, tie-dye, the famous house zigzag pattern, and a surprising amount of prints. Margherita said her project started with research: \u201cI discovered in this process how much bigger Missoni once was. I wanted to give new life to discarded parts of the house heritage.\u201d In some cases, she meant that quite literally. She used yarn from the stockpiles left over from previous seasons for knitwear. Other pieces were fashioned from fabrics originally made from the company\u2019s home collection. A black-and-white print that looked not unlike Keith Haring\u2019s iconic scribbles was drawn by her late grandfather Tai. What distinguished it all from the main collection\u2014and what will make it successful\u2014was its everyday-ness. These weren\u2019t empty runway gestures. Margherita came across a comment her grandfather once made\u2014\u201cIn the future, everyone will wear a tracksuit\u201d\u2014and kept it in mind while developing the pieces, but there was much more on offer besides tie-dyed sweaters and logo track pants. The magic was in the mix: a sequined tank dress over a striped ribbed sweater, a windowpane blazer worn with Lurex-shot crocheted pants, a mixed-floral midi skirt topped by a shrunken knit cropped well above the navel. The collection will be available in sizes XS to XXL, meaning that men will be able to fit into it if they want to.

Or, as was the case this season, on a thin sheet of water. Harrison and Haas\u2019s Spring 2020 collection for Galvan was inspired by the legendary choreographer Pina Bausch and her work titled Vollmond, a dance piece that takes place on a water-washed floor. This season, the clothes certainly move and flow: Textures include buttery Lurex, wisp-thin patchwork lace, delicate sequins, and fluid silk. Overall, the collection is glamorous, as Galvan collections typically are, but this season also saw a slightly more streamlined point of view from Harrison and Haas. Aside from the bold purple lace and metallic sequins, there were simpler pieces, including a pretty burnt orange version of one of its most popular slip dresses, as well as a pale blue stretchy ruffled-hem skirt and matching silk camisole. There were more separates this time around, and it was nice to see Harrison and Haas break a bit from the best-selling evening and occasion dresses. It\u2019s a sign of things to come for Galvan, perhaps, as it has been rapidly expanding in the last year or so, widening the range of its bridal offering and introducing a bag line.

It\u2019s the sort of bodacious piece that, while appropriate for working out, would be favored by women famous for their walks from the gym to the car. The catsuit was part of the activewear segment of the Spring collection.

From there the design team segued into glamorous vacationwear. The caftans, flowing skirts, and scarf tops were perfectly Pucci\u2014and maybe a little expectedly so, with sunset colors and a poolside aura.

Reps from one major department store reported that they can\u2019t keep the pieces in stock. But you know how you can really tell that Lee\u2019s making an impact? The world got its first glimpse of his vision for Bottega Veneta via look book last December, when the brand released its Pre-Fall images, but we\u2019re already seeing other designers taking cues from him. Walking into the Via Senato show space tonight, you could sense the heat around the brand and parent company Kering\u2019s endorsement of Lee. Underneath the Perspex runway an elaborate intrecciato floor had been laid\u2014intrecciato being the house\u2019s proprietary woven-leather motif. And above it guests sat on plump cushions that picked up on the pouch clutch\u2019s pillow-like shape (if that sounds like a little throwaway thing, you try perching on hard metal benches for a month). Lee\u2019s got accessories bona fides, without question, but does he have the ready-to-wear to back it up? Spring marks his second runway outing, and what it tells us is that he\u2019s a designer with conviction\u2014there\u2019s no wavering. He extrapolated on the pieces that worked for Fall, showing many iterations of clingy ribbed-knit dresses with interesting twisting elements and cutouts. Men got sweater versions with similar skin-baring details. And without changing course he reconsidered the items that were less successful. The leather pieces, which ranged from anoraks to all-in-ones to trenches, had a lighter aspect this time around. The women\u2019s tailoring, which was more extreme a season ago, was softened somewhat too. His new ideas coalesced loosely around the notion of sportiness. There were lots of leather basketball shorts for the guys and a couple pairs of knee-length shorts for the girls as well. A pair of monkey-and-pineapple-motif scarf tops, the collection\u2019s one brief foray into print, seemed to come out of nowhere. They didn\u2019t quite gel with the rest of the lineup, but as Lee continues to build and round out his Bottega Veneta, he shouldn\u2019t tamp down on that instinct to experiment.

Choosing to go at it alone is difficult on many levels, but it gives designers freedom of expression and the possibility to carve out their own creative vision. For Teodoro, this choice has proven successful so far; his clientele and his business are expanding in a sustainable, organic way. For Spring, he worked on a compact collection which had a less sculptural feel than usual. He traded the architectural, rigorous approach he favors for more sensual, languid silhouettes. Inspired by East Asian art and neoclassical curlicued stuccoed decorations, he had them reproduced on large foulards in light cottons and silks, cut into roomy caftans with exquisite pleated details, or into beautifully elaborated draped column dresses, slightly disheveled and undone. The designer is never literal in his references; the sense of exotic sensuality infused in layered, ruffled long dresses in see-through chiffon was counterbalanced by sharp, \u201990s-inspired tailoring. A fine example was a black tuxedo, its billowy sleeves and see-through back made of sheer black organza; it seamlessly blended rigorous cut and feminine lightness."}, {"Designer": "Luisa Beccaria", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Who says that shows in Milan aren\u2019t entertaining enough?

Models seemed to enjoy playing in the sun, hitting the shuttlecock with thin, elegant rackets; in pure Beccaria fashion, the net was made not with ordinary rope, but handmade white crocheted lace. \u201cIt\u2019s like what happens in real life,\u201d mused Beccaria. \u201cYou try always to hit the ball, sending it back to the other player.\u201d Beccaria and daughter Lucilla have to be given credit for a consistent vision, which encompasses not only fashion but also their entire lifestyle. They are the best ambassadors for their label, living the kind of life their dresses are made for. Yet behind their dreamy, ethereal concoctions of tulle, fil coupe, and embroidered organza, there\u2019s a lot of care and hard work. And life isn\u2019t just an endless series of garden parties, debutante balls, and royal weddings, for which they design sensational numbers of exquisite allure. Their collections also offer more sensible daywear options, obviously filtered through the Beccarias\u2019 romantic lens. For Spring, there were fresh, short scalloped dresses in broderie anglaise; prim pleated skirts in practical stretch cotton; and little sundresses with ruffled skirts in crisp poplin, cut in roomy yet feminine shapes that could fit diverse body types. \u201cWe dress mothers and daughters, different generations,\u201d said Lucilla. \u201cOur creations are beautifully age-friendly.\u201d Diversity was also an issue the designers addressed head-on this season, casting fresh-faced models of various ethnicities, who all looked ravishing in their creations.

The collection wasn\u2019t about the folklore-tinged Greece of tourist board adverts, though\u2014no modest tavernas or barefoot sirtakis on the beach. Rather it was Aristotle Onassis sailing to Skorpios on his yacht, with an upper-crust crew in tow. Think stylish women who love a change of outfit several times a day, even when the yacht stops in a port for lunch at a simple taverna. In the collection, the summery, optimistic, fresh feel of crisp white cotton sundresses printed with geometric motifs contrasted with the glamour of jewel-toned pouf bloomers and bustiers in silk duchesse, heart-shape-embroidered with sparkling crystals and topped with feathered hats. \u201cI love feathers, they\u2019re so dreamy,\u201d chirped Ponti backstage. Sure, but it looked as if she\u2019d overdosed on them, lavishly trimming the sleeves of dramatic black numbers or the hem of \u201960s-inspired trapeze dresses. They seemed more fit for a society swan holidaying in Palm Beach than on a small, unpretentious Greek island. There was a lot else going on in the show, which felt like a medley of Vivetta\u2019s greatest hits; at times, an abundance of visual information seemed to dilute Ponti\u2019s message. The best part was the shirting, where the surrealist verve she favors was displayed with humorous grace on elongated masculine poplin shirts or striped shirt-blazers encrusted with appliqu\u00e9s of Greek statues, lips, hands, and cameos, or else embroidered with cut-out florals. Paired with macram\u00e9 miniskirts, Swarovski-embellished micro-shorts, or slim capri pants, they hit the right tone of cheerful, imaginative freshness. On an interesting note, the show marked a collaboration between Ponti and French artist Garance Vall\u00e9e, who envisioned a set installation with a sculptural quality.

A double-face, vaguely psychedelic, floral-print Lycra shirt\u2019s collar and cuffs were etched in mink. A long, floral Lycra robe-jacket featured overlaid panels of dyed floral-pattern fur, which matched fur-floral beach totes. Wide-weave bags in brown ribbons of leather were intertwined with ribbons of yellow-dyed fur. Brown suede wrap dresses and trenches, lightly perforated to let the breeze pass through, were engagingly loose. A long, Fendi-brown micro-check skirt made of opaque organza was worn beneath a wide-gauge knit racer-back tank with a dipping side-split hem. Also opaque yet still visible was an imprint of Venturini Fendi\u2019s own personal style in the superlight organic washed-cotton workwear pieces\u2014most of all the jacket worn by Selena Forrest\u2014which the designer said she had placed against synthetic twists (such as Forrest\u2019s shiny green-check organza shirt) to mirror the day-to-day yin and yang of digital life and real. The use of some relatively humble materials\u2014a white terry skirt beneath that fur Lycra shirt, the quilted cotton \u201cshower curtain\u201d floral dress at the end\u2014reflected her will to make a collection that would be desired as much for its wearability as its editorial appeal.

Efisio has inherited the love for a good narrative and the energy and bravado to translate it into slightly madcap yet cohesive collections. His aesthetic is imbued with a downtown, irreverent vibe\u2014but despite his efforts to differentiate himself from the poetic, elaborate vision of his father, Antonio, a bit of surreal whimsy has rubbed off on him. For Spring, the conversation he imagined between two strong female personalities, albeit incongruous (\u201cBon-Ton meets disco,\u201d he said), had a sort of fresh appeal, addressing obliquely and with a light, humorous hand relevant themes of race and women\u2019s empowerment. As for the clothes, they looked upbeat and cheerfully feminine, graced by a Warhol-inspired, blown-up flower print in bright colors; short minidresses had a late-\u201960s vibe, while the street-sporty attitude was smoothed in favor of a more girly approach. Sweatshirts and hoodies had brocade details. Diana Ross\u2013inspired long, tentlike dresses were eye-catching, with ruffles and volants galore.

Lennon and Ono\u2019s \u201cbed-in\u201d was the stated starting point, all plush white sheets and pointed displays of protest, but it was the idea of a happy marriage of opposites that the MM6 design team took to heart. Tailored blazers were slashed at the sides to allow for cupcake layers of white tulle to spill out. Menswear-inspired suits collided with women\u2019s lingerie details. (Though the collection is womens wear, some looks were shown on men and will be produced in men\u2019s sizing.) Leather with cotton with denim with lace\u2014it was a mash-up of opposites living in harmony that was, more than some other recent MM6 collections, especially reverent to the thoughtful, intentional work of the brand\u2019s namesake.

Boots were made with tin-can heels, and sweatshirts were sprayed with Just Margiela, inspired by the way cars are decorated for just-married couples. Other graphics included a Better Half hoodie and a bouquet of roses superimposed on a circle dress\u2014be your own better half and be your own bouquet, they seemed to say. Maybe the big message here was that for all the unity and community we strive for, sometimes you just gotta be the star of your own show.

A pair of men\u2019s briefs in see-through nude net tulle arrived encased in a clear PVC envelope. Slightly puzzled by the message, I asked the designer backstage to expand on the subject. \u201cIt\u2019s just a provocation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it can come across as a not-too politically correct statement. The briefs are masculine but can also be worn by a woman. So what? There\u2019s too much bigotry and moralism around these days. There\u2019s zero tolerance for too many things. I think it\u2019s time to say basta!\u201d Dell\u2019Acqua rounded the message by referencing the famous collection du scandale, designed by Yves Saint Laurent in 1971\u2014at the time it made waves with its overt erotic tones, while launching the couturier into the fashion stratosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite collections of all time,\u201d said Dell\u2019Acqua. Its spirit of sophisticated transgression appealed to the designer, resonating with his penchant for insouciant eroticism. The coed Spring collection, a first for Dell\u2019Acqua, had un undone, provocative feel, with a certain disheveled polish thrown in for good measure. Flowing dresses in microfloral-printed, washed, sweet-hued chiffon\u2014primrose, candy pink, pea green\u2014looked deceptively demure, but their billowy sleeves were slit to reveal the arms with apparent nonchalance. Pleated skirts were buttoned-unbuttoned askew on one side, exposing the legs. Floral shirtdresses were worn as if they were one-shouldered; diagonal slits on bodices revealed a lingerie top underneath. Even tailored blazers got their dose of unraveling, with sleeves mercilessly cut open. The look felt pretty sensual, confident, and alluringly elegant, without crossing the line into being too obviously, boringly seductive. Lately Dell\u2019Acqua has introduced an atelier-like feel in his No. 21 collections, working on more substantial volumes with rich, luxurious fabrics like cady, gazar, silk cloqu\u00e9, and duchesse, yet he has kept the attitude modern, feminine, and unfussy. Here he continued the play on short balloon shapes and abbreviated hourglass silhouettes embroidered with crystal ribbons, nicely contrasting the fluidity of drapings and asymmetries or the playful strictness of tailoring. It made for a convincing exercise in style dynamics. Menswear was infused with a feminine, nonconformist vibe; suits were cut sharp but softened by micro-floral allover prints and worn with baggy, slouchy Bermudas or overstretched, open-cut-sleeve knits. As for the invitation briefs, they\u2019ve apparently proved a success. \u201cThey\u2019re in great demand!

The husband-and-wife duo explored natural raffia detailing in their new collection, in vivid counterpoint to the sharp tailoring that the house is known for. Minimalism may be at the essence of the brand, but that aesthetic can lean antiseptic and cold. At a moment when consumers are examining their designer purchases more closely than ever, evidence of the hand is not just a point of distinction, it\u2019s a way to exhibit heart and soul. To make a connection. The Meiers were indeed thinking about connections with this show. A pair of prints\u2014one of fish, the other virgins\u2014were designed to represent their Pisces (Lucie) and Virgo (Luke) signs: They\u2019re astrological opposites. The notion of opposites was another organizing principle. They liked the look of a tailored two-button jacket over a silk slip dress or a draped jersey dress in a new-for-them marble print, and they also paired long silk tunics embroidered with sequins in the shapes of birds over narrow trousers: structure and flou; soft and hard. It can be difficult to wrestle the stiffness out of the Sander legacy, so these were meaningful steps forward for the duo. Backstage they discussed the Viennese Secession movement of the 1900s and the psychedelic movement of the 1960s. Their liveliest print yet, that swirling marble motif, took cues from both eras. The way forward for the Meiers is to put the blinders on to outside influences (the #oldCeline-Loewe spectrum that they travel on is crowded) and to zero in on what really matters (at 60 looks the show was quite a few looks too long). First and foremost they should follow the colorful creative instinct that saw them step out of their comfort zone."}, {"Designer": "Marchesa", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "In the Marchesa showroom, you expect to see a few things: ruffles, 3-D flowers, and layer upon layer of floor-sweeping tulle. Spring 2020 was almost sleek in comparison, with its newly languid, curve-skimming lines. Georgina Chapman\u2014now the solo designer of Marchesa, following cofounder Keren Craig\u2019s departure this summer\u2014found her inspiration in portrait photographer Ruth Harriet Louise, the only female photographer working in Hollywood in the \u201920s. Her famous portraits of Greta Garbo, Nina Mae McKinney, and Joan Crawford were tacked on Chapman\u2019s mood board and captured the freer, slimmer look women embraced at the time. There were other snippets of \u201920s-era fashion, moody flower arrangements, and, of course, tons of Jazz Age glitz. A few looks had sparkling trompe l\u2019oeil embroideries, like the opening number: a sheer column covered in beads with a built-in satin shawl artfully draped around the bust. Another glittering \u201cnaked dress\u201d appeared to have a black satin skirt knotted at the waist, but in fact it was all one piece. Other gowns simply felt lighter, as if they\u2019d had some stuffing removed, such as the narrow beige column with fluttering marabou feathers and the vaguely Grecian sky blue dress with appliqu\u00e9d flowers twisting around the torso. Not every look was so streamlined\u2014fans of Marchesa\u2019s signature ball skirts will still find a few here\u2014but the new direction felt refreshing and relevant. Chapman is attuned to women\u2019s changing tastes, and many of them want something less fussy and traditional. One dress occupied a nice middle ground between past and present: an ombr\u00e9 gown with cascading ruffles. From afar, it looked like many Marchesa dresses we\u2019ve seen before, but peer closer and the edges were left unfinished and fraying. It lent a raw, unprecious quality to something quite familiar, and it\u2019s a concept Chapman should continue to explore in the coming seasons."}, {"Designer": "Alberta Ferretti", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood may be divisive, but there\u2019s one thing we can all agree on, right?

Though Alberta Ferretti didn\u2019t quote her specifically, elements of the designer\u2019s new Spring show could\u2019ve been taken from Pussycat\u2019s playbook, among them the coveralls, the midriff-exposing crop tops, and the rainbow palette. For the last couple of years, Ferretti has been reorienting her label around daywear and giving it a determinedly youthful aspect. That came across more than ever in this new collection, with its retro \u201970s lean. It\u2019s the kids that didn\u2019t experience an era the first time around who embrace its second and third iterations and so on down the line. Ferretti worked to modernize the show\u2019s \u201970s impulses, by, say, pairing a suede mini with an of-this-moment striped button-down. But the pieces that stood out were the ones that bore her signature crafty detailing: a whipstitched suede jacket, a butterfly motif slip dress pieced together from many different colors of silk, the intensely embroidered half-shirts. Nobody needs Alberta Ferretti pleated chinos, however. The abstracted black-and-white animal print pieces also felt like outliers. Ferretti\u2019s evening grouping came in d\u00e9grad\u00e9 shades of blue and black.

Creative directors at big companies get comfortable issuing commands; Zanini has no one to order around but himself. But the risk is paying off.

Honest and unpretentious but hardly plain, they wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed, especially not when accessorized with the crystal drop earrings and extra-long necklaces Zanini made in collaboration with the jeweler Ilenia Corti.

She started the habit as she grew out of her kinder wear outfits in the 1920s, all the way until she stopped buying clothes in the 1980s. He said: \u201cI only found out about it after she passed away. It was an archive of prints and patterns and textures. The past was sacred to her.\u201d As a tribute to Mathilde, this collection combined both her lifetime and that of her grandson in clothes. The sailor collar looks near the end were reminiscent of Mathilde\u2019s school uniform and the blue floral emblematic of the folk pottery tradition of her Transylvanian birthplace. The grayish patched pieces\u2014skirt, waistcoat, and first men\u2019s look\u2014were made of swatches of fabrics taken from past Arbesser collections. He said he stitched them together before running them through his washing machine (hence the gray), and added: \u201cThis is my story in fabric.\u201d The collection reflected the layers of meaning behind it in a marvelously gathered black-on-white polka dot dress with an irregularly beaded hem, within whose pattern softer, larger, yellow dots were hidden. From his own box of fashion memories, Arbesser took past motifs\u2014the punchy paint splash florals, the diamond check, those layered polka dots, the big scrunchy sun hat\u2014and presented them afresh. To signify the personal nature of his material, the designer presented his initials as shadowed solids on prints reminiscent of Sesame Street alphabet education animations. Maybe it was because he was so familiar with so many of the ingredients at his fingertips that Arbesser was able to shape such an especially interesting and attractive collection today. He only rarely presented variations on the same look more than once, yet there was still a coherence in the whole that gave it a distinct sense of identity and authorship. Arbesser said afterwards: \u201cThere is so much of everything. So the only way to do this is to be personal and to tell a story that is a real story. Otherwise there is no point.\u201d He also added that Mathilde, who could be quite \u201charsh,\u201d used to tell him: \u201cWhat you think is beautiful doesn\u2019t mean it is beautiful: other people have different taste.\u201d That\u2019s quite true, of course.

Pared-down dusters, monochrome layered pailette-scattered pleated skirts, sleek leather short-suits, rich berry-toned linen suits, and irregularly striped marini\u00e8re sweaters were all part of a gently referential dance between \u201990s grunge and minimalism (very softly whispered) and the tailoring prowess of the house. \u201cI think that tastes are becoming more streamlined and simple\u2014still chic and luxurious\u2014but more attuned to volumes and shapes rather than elaborate details as they have been in the last four or five years,\u201d said Cucinelli. He expanded on this statement by citing Jil Sander, Yohji Yamamoto, and Giorgio Armani as the prime examples of this design philosophy he had followed in the \u201980s and \u201990s. One thing that\u2019s certain is the notion of buying a single precious garment (or boot) that will serve you for life, rather than opting for a semi-precious fancy that will be worn for a season, is the direction in which consumers are\u2014and should\u2014be shifting. Much in this collection, those Opera knits especially, were evidence that Brunello Cucinelli is a prime destination for the enlightened shopper."}, {"Designer": "Prada", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "At Prada, the beauty always lies in the details. Here are a few from this afternoon\u2019s showing of the Spring/Summer 2020 women\u2019s collection. The industrial hangar-like space in the Fondazione was striped with orange paint, the massive columns covered in gold foil, and the glossy floor hand-tiled in funky geometric patterns rendered in those deliberately naive off-pastels that, when thrown together, look fabulously sophisticated. It was nerdy and joyful, a mix of natural light and high gloss. And the same could be said for the eclectic and starry front row: here, Nicole Kidman; there, A$AP Rocky; and over yonder, Wes Anderson, whose museum show opens tomorrow night at the Prada complex, and who has long championed the sherbet hues. The first model out was Freja Beha Erichsen, the legendary cool girl of fashion so very Prada in her helplessly timeless hipness. From the get-go, this was the brand in familiar yet intriguing top form. And then there were the clothes: spare, elegant, a smidgen \u201970s, a hint \u201950s, unabashedly adorned yet beguiling for the esoteric gals among us. The core items include a tailored jacket, long of line, fabulous in double-face, with belt loops that suggest a waist without being insistent; a dress in cheesecloth, slightly transparent and possibly finished with gold sequin swirls or a necklace of enormous shells; a skirt, pencil or pleated or in embroidered leather, that bisects the shins and is sleek as hell; serious grey wool trousers with a hint of a flare; and summer knits in stripes, chevrons, and skinny cables to keep everything close to the body\u2014vaguely artisanal and graphic yet soft. For lovers of Prada, this is the dream wardrobe: elegant, irreverent, unapologetically pretty, and devoid of conceptual gimmicks. What makes it fresh is how it is worn: Every look involves a mix of textures (macram\u00e9, straw, velvet, calf, patent, rope, bugle beads, paillettes) and context (a waft-y beach dress with a solid pump, an office suit with a macram\u00e9 holiday bag, a silk cocktail dress with a whopping snakeskin platform). For Miuccia Prada, these juxtapositions mean everything for Spring. Her starting point for this collection was that \u201cthe person should be more important than the clothes,\u201d and further, that \u201cpersonal style is more important than clothes.\u201d She was also hoping to make a point about simplicity, non-disposability, and \u201cdoing less.\u201d Timeless hipness is the goal here: Invest wisely in a few items and wear how you like, anywhere and with anything. Grab some shells and call them pearls. Glossiness abounds, even in dark times."}, {"Designer": "Y\u2019s", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Each season, the Y\u2019s studio seems determined to find new ways to recast the label\u2019s core offering of white shirts and black gabardine. Comprised of two sub-groupings, Black and Pink, the former remains dedicated to artisanal experimentation, and the latter is more fashion-focused. Within Black, what was described as \u201ca meeting between bohemian and urban\u201d played out as macram\u00e9, fishnet, and crochet techniques that introduced both texture and movement, depending on how the piece was constructed and/or styled. For instance, the handmade macram\u00e9 knots were noticeably loose and chunky, which offered interesting surface detail for a bag, but might prove unwieldy as a top layer. Crochet, meanwhile, was integrated as tone-on-tone incrustations, creating a noticeably craft-y effect. As yet another novelty, an inky marble print took cues from the Japanese marbling technique Suminagashi, which dates back to the ninth century, but appeared thoroughly circa 2020 as a roomy hooded parka. Among the Pink looks, a punk-inspired attitude counterintuitively coexisted with smocking details. You could see how girls with non-conformist style might find interest in these ample thrift-store pieces\u2014and how they might lend themselves well to magazine editorials channeling a certain raw allure. But they also might have diverged too much from how people perceive Y\u2019s. Then again, this might be deliberate, especially given the label\u2019s strategic split-personality approach."}, {"Designer": "Peter Pilotto", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos decamped to Milan this season, swapping their usual London location for a deep dive into the Milanese fashion zeitgeist\u2014which somehow seemed to rub off on the collection. Trading their usual elaborate silhouettes for more streamlined, utility-friendly shapes, they took a turn towards a decidedly simpler, straightforward aesthetic. \u201cBeing in Milan seemed like a natural step to take,\u201d explained Peter Pilotto, who\u2019s half-Italian. \u201cRecently we\u2019ve come to Italy often working on leather goods, and fabrics have been made in Italy since the start of the label; we\u2019re also producing part of the collection here.\u201d A rich textural work on materials like lurex, brocades, and jacquards together with a whimsical sense of color and a play on elaborate yet feminine shapes have always been at the creative core of the designers\u2019 vision. The added bonus of a high-energy artsy vibe has kept things interesting and progressive. \u201cWe\u2019re known for our occasion dressing, perfect for cocktails and parties,\u201d explained Christopher de Vos. \u201cThis season, we wanted to explore a more everyday, utilitarian look. Probably it has to do with us spending so much time here, mixing pleasure and leisure. Exploring the Italian feel for practicality.\u201d On the catwalk, there were plenty of desirable, practical looks which would easily fit into any wardrobe. Separates abounded: oversized polo and bowling silk shirts in bright colors; workwear-inspired roomy, boxy jackets in washed denim; soft-tailored blazers in shiny satin; crisp silk dusters in beautiful shades of acid green and sapphire blue. Worn with abstract printed tops and slouchy, easy pants and Bermudas, they looked, well, easy and sensible. For the first time, a small menswear offer was also included in the show. \u201cThey\u2019re almost gender-neutral pieces that can be worn both by guys and girls,\u201d said Pilotto. Here again, the silhouettes were relaxed and fluid, energized by lysergic colors and symbolist-inspired, smudged-floral prints. Yet as the show progressed, one was yearning for a bit of drama\u2014or at least a jolt of British irreverence and sense of humor which, injected into the Milanese flair for discipline, could\u2019ve produced an unruly, off-kilter, emotional mix. The best part of the collection was actually when the designers let their expressive, imaginative side do the talking. A play on draping, twisting, and asymmetries looked compelling, gracing short dresses with flowing lateral panels and belted sashes, keeping silhouettes lissome and dynamic with askew-knotted details. The all-over print and fabrication mix added an optimistic, sunny, slightly over-the-top theatrical vibe, hitting a high note and feeling true to the label\u2019s spirit. The disciplined Milan would\u2019ve definitely welcomed a dash of witty, entertaining flamboyance."}, {"Designer": "Reem Acra", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The Emmy Awards take place this weekend, and chances are you will see some of Reem Acra\u2019s megawatt creations from her Spring 2020 lookbook on the red carpet. Sure, Acra is not reinventing the wheel of awards ceremony dressing, but her celebrity clients will be happy. There were her signature big-volume gowns, but they were a little more remixed than usual, particularly thanks to their refreshing, lighter colors. One standout had a high neck and a lush skirt that came in a hue of soft seafoam. Acra also experimented with layering. In the evening dress sphere, layering sounds like an odd concept\u2060\u2014can it get bulky?\u2060 heavy?\u2014but the designer nailed the idea. A halter dress with a Moroccan tile print and a jewel-embroidered collar was styled with a thin tulle overlay, almost as if a light film of smoke beautifully enveloped the model. Acra\u2019s small yet conceptual additions, such as the tulle overlay, help her pieces stand out from the red carpet designer pack. That being said, when she does think outside of the traditional red carpet box, the results are quirky and, yes, still chic. She made a deconstructed windbreaker out of silk taffeta that had a hood and blooming bishop sleeves. It sits oddly on the hanger, but on the body, it\u2019s both bizarre and cool. (I tried it on.) It makes a person feel like a fantastical royal in a medieval court. Maybe it\u2019s not a look for every celebrity to try, but I would applaud one for taking the risk. In one instance, Acra whipped up a clingy column dress with a high neck in a stunning shade of Tiffany blue. (Think: Jackie O in the \u201960s.) She mentioned that the fabric was 10 years old; it was left over from a custom job for a private client. While she did not intentionally mean to upcycle, it\u2019s a moment of a designer exploring the zero-waste concept by digging into her archives. Considering all the talk about fashion\u2019s impact on the environment, Acra should think about using more of her extra material in current collections."}, {"Designer": "Assembly New York", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Making the old feel new again is Greg Armas\u2019s specialty; since he founded Assembly New York, his eye for vintage has largely informed his designs for men and women. Spring 2020 found him thinking about early rave culture, which thrived on reworking 9-to-5 style for after-hours with wild accessories. He interpreted the concept quite literally by mixing his signature suits and shirting with chunky boots and shield sunglasses. There was a new, graphic energy in the zebra stripes and tie-dyed jeans, too, but if you took everything apart, each piece was still inherently wearable. That\u2019s another Armas specialty: clothes that are easy to wear in \u201creal life,\u201d but still feel interesting. On that note, an oversize, single-sleeved white button-down would pair just as well over a tank and trousers (as shown here) as with jeans. Less intuitive was the abstract bandeau-and-skirt set, but Assembly customers who enjoy layering will get a kick out of Armas\u2019s suggestion to layer a clashing blouse underneath. The designer said he felt he took the biggest risk with color: \u201cI like to challenge myself every season,\u201d he explained. \u201cAqua and lavender are tones that I\u2019ve never really played with.\u201d On the men\u2019s side, Armas pointed out a classic blazer embroidered with real keys, a nod to \u201clatchkey kids\u201d who wore house keys around their necks when their parents worked late. He even included one of his own keys, which opens a longtime friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles. \u201cIf you were a kid, you may have only had one, but if you\u2019re a bit older, you might have five or six different keys, which are all represented on this special tuxedo jacket,\u201d he said. The concept was mirrored on a pair of jeans as well. Those keys weren\u2019t the central story of Spring, but they added a nice personal touch. Armas\u2019s love of vintage extends beyond those retro concepts and silhouettes: This season, he reported that 90 percent of the fabrics were upcycled or repurposed. It\u2019s a New Age trend rooted in the past, and it\u2019s gaining popularity this season as fashion attempts to address its massive impact on the environment."}, {"Designer": "Charlotte Knowles", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "What\u2019s underwear is outerwear these days\u2014you only have to look at paparazzi images of Gigi Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski, and Kendall Jenner for proof. This young generation isn\u2019t so much burning their bras as they are wearing it under a smart blazer to Sunday brunch. Charlotte Knowles and her design partner Alexandre Arsenault are leaning into that idea with gusto with their new label. Still, lingerie right now comes with a much sportier edge. Where push-up balconettes shaped the look of the early aughts, a sporty, spandex-ed silhouette is the look of now. To wit, Lily McMenamy opened the show in nude cycling shorts and a strapless bustier top that seemed to mine the sweet spot between athleisure, shapewear, and the club. Arsenault and Knowles, however, think of their second-skin clothes in more radical terms. Entitled Venom, the Spring collection was conceived as a kind of armor, or what they\u2019re calling \u201cmilitarized corsetry.\u201d Speaking backstage, Arsenault described the collection \u201cas a reaction to the current climate. Our woman is fighting for her place in the world. She is tough and dangerous.\u201d Look closely and you\u2019ll find there were indeed tactical details to their bodycon layers: with velcro-strap closures, the crop tops were reminiscent of tactical vests; ditto for the teeny-tiny bikini tops that were layered over mesh tops. As an alternative to camouflage, Charlotte Knowles posited woozy bleeding checks and bleached-out floral prints. They added a cool touch to mesh turtlenecks and cowl-neck dresses that were layered over kicky leggings. As the craze for vintage Jean Paul Gaultier reaches critical mass, thanks in no small part to Kim Kardashian West\u2019s ongoing obsession, this London-based label is poised to take the look in a new and ecologically sound direction\u2014the bodysuits and swim were made from regenerated nylon. Given the label\u2019s pointed messaging, it was somewhat disappointing to find the casting lacking in a body-positive spirit. With brands like Savage x Fenty and Chromat making space for inclusive sizing, the notion that lingerie\u2014or lingerie-inspired clothing, in this case\u2014should conform to supermodel beauty standards is thoroughly old fashioned. With that in mind, it would have been nice to see the label\u2019s skintight clothing and bustiers filled out with a range of body types."}, {"Designer": "Palmer Harding", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "As Levi Palmer explained it, a selection of dilapidated Soviet-era Russian bus stops provided the inspiration for this Palmer Harding collection. That makes it sound way less appealing than it was. Matthew Harding\u2019s preamble about the collection hardly made you want to scramble to pre-order either: \u201cThere is a lot of balance between optimism and pessimism, working to find a balance between not being naive about all the troubling uncertainties of now and not allowing them to jam you up.\u201d Once we got to the racks, however, things became brighter. One particular depressing but architecturally impressive bus stop, all floating folds of Brutalist concrete and wan wasteland, inspired the pair to focus on extraction pleating (in which you cut out a panel of the fabric before pleating around it). This created a very interesting modular cinching effect on a white shirt, and some equally innovative effects on pleated shorts. Another influence was the photography of William Eggleston\u2014 the designers were drawn to his play of bright color against mundane subject\u2014and an example of this was a bishop-sleeve collarless shirt whose green and red exactly mirrored the pink and green of an Eggleston shot. Knitwear, a growing category for the brand, included a long dress in shadowy, angled stripes. A full, folded shoulder and back detail that proved a hit last season was carried over in jackets and jersey tops. The designers have merged what was their vacation line into their main, and for Spring it featured full-volume separates in neutral-tone check seersucker. A long chambray dress boasted that reliable staple, a set of phantom sleeves knotted to work as a belt. A very restrained red, white, and blue color story and the beaten bottle-top buttons on a khaki denim jacket meant to be worn against shorts offered the quietest touch of Americana. Said Palmer, \u201cWe wanted it in there but without going MAGA.\u201d Oh, Lordy: That troubling uncertainty just crept in again."}, {"Designer": "Marysia", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "On a particularly warm day during New York Fashion Week, a designer said the most important color in fashion right now is\u2026brown. It\u2019s true that earth tones have been trending on and off the runway for a few seasons, and even swimwear designers are taking note, hence Marysia Reeves\u2019s announcement. Her Spring 2020 collection ignored the rules of \u201cwhat sells\u201d in swim\u2014typically bright colors and prints\u2014in favor of rich camel, chocolate, and cream. The season\u2019s \u201cstatement color\u201d was the palest, iciest blue, hardly a statement at all. There were items not pictured here in more classic shades of red and deep green, but Reeves had enough newness to keep the look book hyper-focused. One bit of news was the range of ruched one-pieces and \u201cswim dresses,\u201d which were a simpler, more covered-up foil to Reeves\u2019s signature scalloped bikinis. Bigger news was the continued evolution of her ready-to-wear. Spring felt like a big leap from breezy dresses and cover-ups to full-on, realistic daywear\u2014and even a bit of eveningwear. The prettiest dress was also the fanciest: a drop-waist pleated satin midi-dress in that barely-there shade of blue. The idea is that the Marysia customer who needs a new swimsuit for her vacation likely needs a low-key party dress too. She\u2019ll be intrigued by the soft, \u201940s-ish cotton dress in a graphic print inspired by sea urchins too, and certain girls will find ways to simply wear the swimsuits as \u201creal clothes.\u201d In subtle neutrals, it\u2019s easy to justify styling a Marysia bandeau or rashguard as a top, perhaps with one of her new billowing, drop-waist maxiskirts or macram\u00e9 sarongs. It\u2019s tempting to make the argument that fashion\u2019s embrace of earth tones jibes with our growing concern for the planet and a desire to reconnect with nature. It\u2019s only now that the industry is getting serious about sustainability, but the idea makes sense. For designers whose businesses revolve around women going on vacation, as Reeves\u2019s does, it might be even more important to start tackling the sustainability issue. The carbon footprint of a flight to Kauai or Bali is significant, but if you're going, you can at least pack some consciously made clothes and swimsuits in your carry-on. In 2020, Reeves is making that a bigger priority than ever and hopes her customer is interested in making some changes too."}, {"Designer": "Julien Macdonald", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "At the end, as Olivia Newton John sang \u201cXanadu\u201d over a seriously amped-up beat, the crowd just couldn\u2019t wait to be on the runway. They thronged the parquet of Southwark Cathedral\u2013a place of worship that has surely seen such frenzied devotion as this\u2014while Julien Macdonald, Gabriela Gonzalez, and their models were still doing their final circuit. The show was perfectly calibrated to get those guests on their feet and whooping. Before it began, the music was pumping and the cocktails powerful. For those who were not under the influence, there was the intoxicating proximity to influencers: Photographers jostled to shoot Lottie Moss, Sabrina Elba, Munroe Bergdorf, Victoria Hervey, Hana Cross, Ed Westwick, Mary Charteris, and many others. This whetted the appetite. However, the most potent ingredient of all in Macdonald\u2019s hot-show recipe was, of course, the clothes. Since the withdrawal of Roberto Cavalli from fashion, there is arguably nobody who produces such unabashedly uncut \u201cglamour\u201d as Julien Macdonald. There is Balmain, and there is Versace, of course, but va-va-voom is just part of their arsenals; with Macdonald it is everything. Gabriela Gonzalez, who shared the billing for this collection and walked the runway with him, is a Mexico City\u2013based horse breeder, socialite, and Macdonald customer with whom he has been friends for five years. As he explained on a visit to his studio before the show: \u201cGabriela said it was her dream to do this, and I thought, Why not? I\u2019ll only ever do it once.\u201d The occasional pastel look, normally outside of Macdonald\u2019s spectrum, was included for Gonzalez, and he said he envisioned all of the looks with her in mind. The marble-print resort-meets-swimwear that was cut in among the main collection added a much-appreciated-by-the-audience element of male cleavage to the mix. As was evident in the studio, there is serious substance behind the apparent lack of it in these dresses. Macdonald\u2019s finely knit sheaths, some delicately upholstered with feather or bead in order to jiggle up and down with the beat of the wearer\u2019s walk, are crafted by hand with painstaking care and extreme skill using vintage machines, something he is rightly proud of. His clients appreciate it too. He said: \u201cWhat happens the next day is every dress has been frozen by somebody. Madonna, J.Lo, Ciara, Gwen Stefani . . . they all freeze dresses.\u201d No wonder.

With the country on the brink of a no-deal Brexit and the possibility of an early general election on the horizon as well, Britain\u2019s place in the world has never been more unstable. At Richard Quinn\u2019s show this evening, that troubling dissonance was instantly soothed by the sound of the Philharmonia Orchestra and the Bach Choir. Quinn clearly understands the healing power of music\u2014his shows have played host to a number of life-affirming musical performances in the past, including one by British singer Freya Ridings. But more than that, he believes the runway should uplift and inspire. \u201cA fashion sanctuary, where we can all come and celebrate,\u201d was how he put it in the show notes. There is no denying the allure of his escapist vision. Quinn\u2019s clothes conjure a couture fantasy, with unabashedly extravagant shapes and lavish embellishments. This season the look veered between thigh-grazing confectionary frocks and a more dramatic voluminous silhouette that tumbled to the ground and swept the floor. The floral cocktail dresses of last season were even frothier this time around, bold in the shoulder and replete with handfuls of bows along the sleeves. If that sexy, legs-for-days line evoked frivolity, then the longer, grander gowns readdressed the balance. Though wiped clean of his signature floral prints, the yellow silk charmeuse number sculpted into the shape of a rose across the chest seemed to perfectly exemplify Quinn\u2019s maximalist aesthetic. Quinn has a history of anonymous castings; more often than not, a model\u2019s identity is obscured by a swath of print fabric to match her outfit. He did away with the masks for Spring. Save for the cropped curly wigs, there was nothing to disguise the women on his runway. It was a good thing too, given the cross-generational lineup that included \u201990s runway stars such as Jacquetta Wheeler and Erin O\u2019Connor, who looked especially striking in a long, billowing rose-print dress with balloon sleeves. Undoubtedly the most adorable models to walk the runway in the label\u2019s two-year history were the little schoolgirls dressed in matching marabou-feather hoods and pink and white painterly floral dresses. Quinn\u2019s fantastic surprise finale featured a stunning tableau of exquisite crystal-studded bridal looks in the mold of his eveningwear.

At this show Zhang returned to a signature Chinese garment on which he has worked before, the cheongsam, to incorporate its architecture in sleekly cut minidresses, jackets in floral jacquards, and a marabou-fringed pajama suit. Cheongsam apart, this collection was marked by its abundance of dresses clad in tiers of ruffles whose edges were set with tiny pearlescent beads. They also edged the wedding veils worn with some of the looks. The beads made for an engaging delineation, and even when variations of the trick were repeated again and again and again, the visual message Zhang was stressing was easy on the eye.

Over the last year or so, she\u2019s used her show space for creative play (think, Pina Bausch\u2013style dance performances), or in the case of Fall 2019, a public forum for feminist voices. Her latest act was born out of a conversation with Sharon Horgan, the award-winning actor, writer, and producer. Together they conceived of a series of theatrical vignettes scripted to bring a slice of the real world to the runway. The scenes were universally familiar: a dinner party conversation gone wrong; an awkward breakup, for example. Still, there was a wry, irreverent tone to Horgan\u2019s dialogue that brought a sense of levity to the drama. Lee rarely strays from her key dress silhouettes, though she does like to experiment with color and prints. Worn by models who wafted past the drama unfolding on the catwalks, the zebra-stripe day pieces stood out the most; one sundress tiered with orange, yellow, and blue stripes in particular was a scene-stealer. As for the actresses in the show, there was nothing costumey about their smart navy blue belted dresses. Though you could imagine them being just as comfortable in the label\u2019s newer red carpet looks, including a kelly green short-sleeved floor-length gown that was cinched at the waist with a skinny tonal belt.

His knowledge of the craft of cutting and draping, acquired in Paris at Givenchy, his European instinct for sophisticated sexiness and his affinity for modern fabrics are some of his natural strengths. That, and his proven track record in bringing diversity to the runway and garnering the following of a youth audience. Notwithstanding the corporate responsibility of somehow finding ways to represent the Britishness of Burberry to the world (the most confusing of tasks when even the British themselves are notoriously divided over what on earth that signifies) the more Tisci permits himself to be true to his personal sensibilities, the more the collection moves towards a distinctive signature. After three seasons, he says, the market has started to respond. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a big job. When I arrived, I wanted to go slowly. Now I start to feel more comfortable in my place, to understand a different London,\u201d he said after the show. \u201cThe trench and the check are going to be forever-icons of the house, but society changed, the world is changing and now people want to wear different things\u2014and it doesn\u2019t matter which country it comes from. So the globalization of style is a different approach for me today.\u201d Specifically, he said, \u201cTailoring has started to do super-well, especially for women; the chiffon blouses, sport things and the eveningwear which was not developed before.\u201d Zoom to the suits\u2014inside-out sartorial fits, with the white bindings showing, and to the run of developments in gray jersey, used in tailoring (women\u2019s and men\u2019s), coats and slinky but classy dresses. Allora: this is very much an Italian way of designing, with an innate awareness of how to dress smartly in a warm climate, utilizing the subtle structure of modern fabrics. Monochrome, grays and khakis were Tisci\u2019s through line for most of the show, with many variations of tonal tailoring ranging from modern businessperson suiting to short, leggy skirt suits with dippy hems in back. It helped that he\u2019d dropped the distinction between the bourgeois and the edgy youth looks which had divided previous showings. This looked closer to elevation and consideration of design values across generations\u2014a wise move when persuading customers to invest in a luxury fashion brand. For young guys, to be sure, there were heartland Tisci-isms in the oversized rugby shirts, but the one pair of the baggy shorts that have been his signature since Givenchy days came covered in white lace and with a lace panel fluttering from the back of the matching T-shirt. Along with Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton and Kim Jones at Dior, Tisci is moving the Burberry culture towards a new kind of decorative masculinity. Genuine voices and authentic skills are what make designers stand out today\u2014and in a competitive climate, the powers of true fashion leaders, rather than mere brand operatives, are at a premium. Where Tisci says he connects with Burberry\u2019s heritage is in the Victorian roots of its founder. Gothic Victorianism was an obsession of the young Italian from the outset of his career. We saw it surface amongst the white lace dresses he showed among the pretty, feathered and besparkled eveningwear: an appealing reclaiming of his own background in haute couture. And there was an accessory certain to get people talking: a merge of baseball cap and Victorian bonnet. From side view, the face-concealing peaks triggered audience members to draw comparisons to Handmaid\u2019s Tale headgear. It was purely accidental. Asked about it, Tisci drew a blank. He\u2019s not watched the series.

A regular fixture on Malone\u2019s front row, Nellie was among a circle of strong women who have influenced him. In the show notes, the designer described the creative process as a means of exploring and overcoming his grief. The doodles and handwritten notes printed on long-sleeved mesh tees were touching reminders of his relationship with his grandmother. Though she had no formal education, Nellie had a wealth of fashion knowledge. Her love of corsetry showed up in subtle ways via the ruching along a pale blue body-con turtleneck top and moss green, nip-waisted sleeveless blazers. With a sizeable bespoke business, Malone is deeply connected to the craft of making clothes; he turned the inner workings of his tailoring inside out, and those curvilinear lines wrapped the body in flattering ways along pencil skirts and crombie coats. There was a marked emphasis on eveningwear this season, with a series of impressive floor-sweeping dresses fashioned from deadstock dancewear fabric. Malone\u2019s growing private clientele of fashion insiders and art world types will likely appreciate this youthful, unorthodox, upcycled approach to black tie. The off-the-shoulder asymmetric red ball gown was a good example, and would get all the right attention at an art gala. Like many of his European fashion peers in London, Malone is personally affected by the looming prospect of a no-deal Brexit as an Irish passport holder. Though his status in the U.K. is far from secure, he\u2019s committed to staking his claim here, despite the uncertainty that his business could face on the other end of this critical juncture in the country\u2019s history. Backstage, he made his political feelings quite clear with a shirt that read, quite simply: \u201cFuck Boris.\u201d Similarly, he\u2019s taken a strong stance in the shifting sands of the fashion system, announcing at today\u2019s show that he will no longer be working on a conventional schedule. Moving forward, his collections will be numbered, not tethered to traditional seasons. It\u2019s a bold move on his part, but one that makes sense for several reasons. Beyond aligning with his sustainable production values, it affords him the time and space to amplify the specialness of his one-of-a-kind clothes and better serve the women who have supported him from the beginning."}, {"Designer": "Sports Banger", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "When a model blinded by the mask of his hot pink recycled-pool-toy hazmat suit veers off the runway and hits your laptop with a wheel-wide replica ecstasy pill, well then that\u2019s quite an unusual fashion show. The same applies when the photographer Gavin Watson\u2014of Skins and Raving \u201989\u2014opens it dressed as a town crier decrying modern culture in the sweariest of terms, or when the comedian Diane Chorley struts past in a top printed with Kate Moss as the queen and a judge\u2019s wig made of five-pound notes created by sometime Gaga and Bj\u00f6rk collaborator Fred Butler. It is also surprising when the models snatch iPhones from the front row while wearing outfits made from reassembled child-size Moncler jackets and tiny, doll-size leather trousers and jackets. And as for the vogueing section... This was the second show from Sports Banger, a fast-growing guerilla collective effort whose hub is the Tottenham-based bootlegger Jonny Banger. Held in a very North London industrial unit late on Sunday night, it collided politics, music, hedonism, humor, and fashion to uproarious effect. The product was a show that felt akin to, say, going to Blitz, the Wag, Kinky Gerlinky, Taboo, or Soul II Soul way back when, or maybe spitting and snarling with the punks in the \u201970s, or losing your sweet mind at Shoom in \u201988 or Castlemorton in \u201992: Something was happening here. The early part of the show used a big bloke wearing billboards to signal four past themes in Banger\u2019s guise of bootleg T-shirt designer. British tabloid targets Tulisa Contostavlos and Nigella Lawson, both past subjects of supportive Banger T-shirts, were two of them: a velour tracksuit printed in tabloid splashes (front-page stories) screaming about Lawson made by Banger\u2019s neighbor Luis Tottenham Textiles was especially funny. The Nike Swoosh x NHS design in support of British health-service workers featured a dress worn by Natalie Amoatin, who was cured of sickle cell disease at age 14 by pioneering NHS treatment. A Tottenham-based NHS midwife, who kept her mask on for anonymity, wore scrubs printed with legal letters that Banger received complaining of copyright infringement as well as letters from NHS workers in support. There were also designs casting F-based judgment on Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the policies of his Conservative Party. After the politics, an interlude: Ballroom scene dancers from Paris and London emerged in trash-bag blouses and trash-can hats (the collection was entitled Pop Culture Is Trash) and did their thing un-be-lievably to the accompaniment of an MC named Taboo, choreographed by Emanuelle Soum, aka Elle Miyake Mugler. Banger said afterward: \u201cOften when they do vogueing in fashion, it is white females. We wanted to rep what it is; butch black gay men femme.\u201d In between some raucously worn high-camp dresses, some made of pool toys and studio scraps, others referencing Thierry Mugler and Fantazia raves, there was the phone-snatching Moncler section as modeled by rappers Black Josh and Chunky. Banger said the point was to highlight the wave of London \u201cmoped muggings,\u201d in which young kids steal phones to buy designer clothes. The Moncler look, made of counterfeits he\u2019d bought in Manchester, was quite genius. All through the show the sound system at the end of the runway was doing its thing. My bench was bouncing. And at the end of it, an audience that had laughed and screamed throughout the show screamed for more. Outside, Banger name-checked the designers\u2014Maria Bracher, Max Allen, and Ancuta Sarca\u2014who had helped him build this hilarious and excellent show. He said: \u201cThis has been the work of a lot of people who\u2019ve come together and had fun. And we\u2019re starting to think let\u2019s just focus on the fashion, and try and build a team, and do wages and make a fashion house\u2014and use it to smash heads together.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Christopher Kane", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "More joy! Christopher Kane and his sister, Tammy, newly independent, are constantly celebrating their coded complicities on their Instagram feeds and in their collections these days. The slogan they\u2019ve adopted, drawn from the title of the 1970s Masters and Johnson sex manual, has spun off to mean everything from pure spontaneous enjoyment of life\u2019s little moments to the key to their design methods\u2014which always embed a surreptitious sexual motive somewhere in their designs. Eco-Sexual was the title of the Spring collection. \u201cIt\u2019s about people who love nature,\u201d declared Christopher. \u201cMaking love in nature. Being in touch with the earth. Sleeping with the stars! We\u2019ve had a lot of fun coming up with words for it in the studio.\u201d One of the starting points was a photograph they\u2019d taken this glorious summer of a re-wilded area of their local park, London Fields. Blown-up images of wildflowers were projected on the walls of the show space and used as prints at the opening of the presentation. The reproductive forces of nature\u2014whether in botany or human behavior\u2014have always been an obsession for the designer. As far as he\u2019s concerned, the pleasure principles that drive us to want to dress up are on that seamless continuum\u2014he has no taboos, whether it\u2019s about what goes on behind suburban closed doors, on disco floors, or indeed in the sublimated desire of a woman to magnetize a room with the power of her chic. All these facets from Kane\u2019s encyclopedia of the erotic were on display here. A black cage dress with petal-like cutouts, bolted together with silver studs. Frills and flounces suspended from thread-fine straps. Nature as captured in classic paisley patterns and floriform white eyelet dresses and blouses reminiscent of Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u2019s Art Nouveau. A comeback of the sheer neon lace dresses and the slinky silver chain mail Kane made girls lust after at the beginning of his career. Just as pulse-racingly hot today. High fashion that sends out irresistible but covert seduction signals is really the genius of Christopher Kane. On that kind of wavelength, it would be hard to beat the impact of, say, the combination of a black tuxedo jacket with matching rectangular crystal brooches on either lapel, shrugged over a floor-length cerise lace dress with a plunging neckline. Throughout Kane\u2019s career, his female fans have testified to the fact that his work doesn\u2019t date\u2014separates such as these will likely be kept and worn again and again. But loving the planet? Giving that as a topical message for our times begs an obvious question. How much care does Kane take over minimizing the environmental impact of his company? Since leaving the Kering group, Kane says he\u2019s absorbed the sustainability standards of the corporation (which are some of the best in that echelon of the industry) into his own company. Over time, he and his sister will make sure they continue to improve on that front.

Camilla Freeman-Topper and her brother Marc Freeman launched their line in 2003 from their hometown of Sydney. Like many fashion labels born in Australia, the easy, breezy, beachy aesthetic was their bread and butter for many years. It can be difficult for a surf-and-sun-born Aussie brand to break away from that characteristic and grow into a global fashion brand, but after 15 years of perpetually tweaking, perfecting, and upgrading materials, Freeman-Topper and her brother deserve props for successfully turning the Camilla and Marc label into something that holds up far away from the beaches of Sydney and can sit comfortably among other popular, high-end contemporary labels across the globe. Their Spring 2020 collection made this abundantly clear. Freeman-Topper spoke lovingly and proudly about this season\u2019s designs over the phone from Australia, where they\u2019re still based. She talked about the strong tailoring, the architectural silhouettes, and the custom prints they\u2019ve developed recently. Indeed, it is probably their most cohesive and sophisticated lineup yet: The A-line skirting, structured blazers, voluminous dresses, and soft color palette mixed with vibrant patterns to make up an effortlessly cool and sharp everyday wardrobe. Everything is wearable but with runway-level style and quality, which can be a difficult formula to pull off if you\u2019re trying to keep the price point reasonable and appeal to a slightly more mass audience. If Camilla and Marc can adhere to that strategy and not go too far into the capital-F fashion territory, then they\u2019ll continue on a path that leads them forward and further from their humble beginnings at the beach."}, {"Designer": "Phoebe English", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "How many designers have ever put a statement of mea culpa at the heart of their show? None, right. Phoebe English is the first.

Her designs, for men and women, have a deceptive simplicity which belies the thoughtfulness that goes into the zero-waste pattern cutting, upcycled scraps pieced together from earlier collections, and the overdyeing with organic indigo she does to freshen the look of what went before.

Crystal decoration has emerged as a theme of the season in many collections; here, he wrought it into a terrific combination of jeweled bras tied on with rope straps and chunky belts worn to one side of the hip. Reiteration of variations on a theme are persuasive in his work. Cotton canvas dresses had holes surrounded by crystal embroidery ripped into one side. The futuristic goddesses had drapey asymmetrical tunics, sometimes in print, sometimes in gold and silver lam\u00e9. A growing sophistication is a mark of how far Anderson has come.

One: the almost complete disappearance of the waist. Two: the mass conversion of women to ankle-length skirts for every moment of the day (as amply demonstrated by many showgoers). Three: the arrival of single, retina-vibrating jolts of color in outfits\u2014and the special art of splashing on a clash with a scarf or suchlike. Erdem Moralioglu\u2019s collection tied all of the above together as his as a long, stately procession of women began to tread on platform sandals along the gravel of a wide, tree-lined path in a London square. Seeing them silhouetted against the green led to yet another thought: how perfectly they fit into the scenery, like guests at a particularly well-dressed summer wedding. This socially attuned design is, of course, Erdem\u2019s talent (his own wedding to Philip Joseph a couple of weeks ago was a fully begowned affair), but he always arrives at his collections through the biographies of particular people. This time, it was the multi-episodic life of Tina Modotti, whom he characterized as \u201ca romantic and revolutionary, a woman of principle. Each outfit was like a postcard from a part of her life.\u201d Stylistically, what fascinated him was studying Modotti\u2019s phases. Born in Italy, she became a silent movie actress in Hollywood and a photographer and communist in Mexico (she traveled to Russia with the Mexican Communist Party), before meeting an early death in suspicious circumstances. \u201cShe found a cause that she believed was right, fought for it, and eventually suffered the biggest consequence,\u201d he said. The pictures of Modotti\u2019s life inspired Erdem\u2019s voluminous proportions, the exaggerated shape of yoke blouses, rose embroideries, and the fringed shawls he tailored to sit on the shoulders without slipping. \u201cIt was the waistless-ness, tiers, the combination of Victorian dress and traditional dress that interested me,\u201d he said. As for the pops of color? Erdem had spent time at the Casa Luis Barrag\u00e1n in Mexico City.

Afterward Becker said there were quite a few pieces he found extremely winning, before adding that he\u2019d come along at the invitation of a friend who has invested in the brand. What a wise investment that might prove if handled right. One of Yousefzada\u2019s baseline talents is tailoring\u2014his pants are fetishized by clients for their cut and comfort\u2014and here he presented two zingily colored suits, yellow and green, with foliage tracings in jacquard that were centered by wide, bow-tied belts. Partially obscured beneath a topcoat in the Indonesian-touched botanical print that recurred here and there was a double-breasted bronze floral short suit that had both slouch and structure. Yousefzada is also adept at crafting high-impact eventwear, and for Spring, even in what was ostensibly a day section, he played with arresting silhouettes. A dress that fell in draped panels, like pools between waterfalls flowing down to the left ankle, was constructed of a washed striped cotton; this modest fabric cut in such an elaborate structure made it doubly look-twice. Becker filmed an open-back minidress built in loops of black organza that was a patently smashing choice for ruling any room.

Have a swipe through: Here, we see a new, concise, but sensual minimalism; the taste for black, for one-shoulder asymmetry, and the shadowy transparency that links her to a fresh matrix of energy on the rise across fashion. Lele\u2019s fusion of traditional Indian dress with the specific sensibility of an English girl is part of a new wave of vitality surfacing through art schools into British fashion\u2014the creative electricity inherent in the imaginations of second- and third-generation immigrants in the U.K. \u201cIt\u2019s about being from two places, and not really knowing if you\u2019re from here or there,\u201d she said. \u201cThese ideas of these skeletons of your identity . . . the damping down of the identity you go through as a teenager\u2014and then finding your confidence to grow into a woman and find yourself.\u201d Her family memory of saris and the traditional bodices worn with them are concisely synthesized into her own experience as a fashion- and music-aware \u201990s girl who was a teen metalhead. \u201cI did architecture before I did fashion,\u201d she said. \u201cI was drawn to minimalism. I think I was shying away from my own culture\u2014literally doing the opposite. I love Helmut Lang and Martin Margiela, how amazing it was that they could do something so nuanced and clever with a little touch or gesture.\u201d Her expression of the consciousness of an English girl with a foot in two cultures is subtle and sexy: A place where vestigial Lang-like harnesses are indivisible from the asymmetry and delicacy of South Asian dress and its underpinnings; where modern body-conscious stretch dresses echo Indian madras checks; where slit skirts and skin-baring wraparound crop tops signal hip sensuality and strength. \u201cI bleached and distressed saris and overlaid them with sheer black fabric,\u201d said Lele. \u201cThe lime green shorts, checked trousers\u2014all the prints were from saris.\u201d It was a slick black tailored rubber coat, fastened high, that opened the show, however. A flashback to Lele\u2019s days as a Slayer and Black Sabbath fan, whose parents tolerated her days of thrashing a drum kit in her bedroom provided she kept up with her schoolwork.Which she certainly did\u2014all the way to a master\u2019s degree in fashion from the Royal College of Art, from whence she graduated in 2016. Identity and intersectionality are at the essential core of what makes fashion interesting and relevant today. Yes, Lele stands with that generational band of like-minders who are putting minimalism back on the map this season. But her creative intelligence is just as importantly a culmination of Indian and British postcolonial heritage, which has never been manifested on a London runway from a female perspective until this moment. \u201cI thought, How can I make a really nuanced version of it that I\u2019ve never seen before?\u201d she said. \u201cIt was important to me to show that you can do that.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Roksanda", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "One of the benches under Junya Ishigami\u2019s slate-roof pavilion at the Serpentine Gallery was populated entirely by a group of well-behaved schoolgirls, who Roksanda Ilincic said afterward was comprised of her 9-year-old daughter, Efimia, and her classmates. What a lucky bunch: They missed Monday morning class and got to see firsthand a show that must have seemed inspirational. Efimia\u2019s mother is a wonderful colorist of a designer who has long been a go-to source of statuesque, clean-lined gowns brushstroked in arresting tones. At her Serpentine shows\u2014this was her third\u2014she has moved on to consider all the art forms her venue encompasses. She said: \u201cI want to combine architecture, art, and fashion. This is happening a lot here in London at the moment; it is one of the positive things coming out of other negative things.\u201d That tangerine runway, then, was a nod to Christo and Jeanne-Claude\u2019s 2016 installation The Floating Piers on Italy\u2019s Lake Iseo, while the backdrop behind the models was Ishigami\u2019s textured roof. The collection started plainly slate-toned with some loose dungarees cut from superfine tailoring cotton and some suiting featuring detachable inner jackets and sash details. These looks and their cousins, sometimes cut in jersey, represented an extra artist contamination in its echo of some of the menswear experiments we saw in Paris back in June. Soon enough Ilincic began dabbing color at the canvas in front of her via oversize work shirts in scarlet and pink. A long, flowing jersey dress in pink hung below a mustard scarf and was worn beneath a cashmere camel coat that featured a double-face belt in pink and camel. Another long dress, this time in washed-out apricot, boasted a vivid red scarf: Ilincic said here she was playing with inspiration drawn from artist Mary Weatherford\u2019s neon intersected paintings. She had already hinted at the voluminous experiments ahead thanks to ruffle-shoulder shifts in either Weatherford-inspired prints on overpainted pliss\u00e9 or hot red cotton. She turned that volume up some more with bulbously elegant gowns in metal-stiffened taffeta, one in bare sackcloth, one in soft lilac that played against another scarf, another in green. Other enjoyable details included a long jersey dress cut in vertical bolts of ochre tones and oversize 1980s-style track jackets, some printed, others in Ilincic\u2019s woozy colors. It is another designer, Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino, whose recent sensational experiments in billowing volume and retina-roasting color have made some of the grander pieces we saw here feel in sync with a wider fashion movement right now. Yet they never seemed derivative, just in tune.

This season he chose another path, one which at first seemed less exciting but grew steadily to mesmerize. At the far end of the runway, two musicians, Candida Valentino and Michael Ormiston, played gongs, wind chimes, and birdcalls to weave a blissed-out soundscape. The collection that came out in front of them was a lengthy meditation on Indian tradition, heartily Ashish-ified. Embroideries from Rajasthan and Shisha mirror work, especially prevalent in Gujarat, the designer said, were the two main decorative subjects. The mirror work\u2014small circular mirrors embroidered onto the fabric behind them\u2014was applied to denim pieces in mixed-wash panels or cotton jersey tracksuits. It was also re-created on the majority of pieces in this collection using Ashish\u2019s beloved sequins. The results of both variations were very beautiful, wave after wave of glinting colored horizontal stripes on simple, almost uniform garments beneath them. The Rajasthani embroideries were more of a jumbled kaleidoscope and just as compelling. Ashish said he had mixed fabrics made by himself with vintage patches sourced from India to create collage garments that sometimes resembled \u201960s-era hippy trailwear. As the musicians softly repeated their abstract mantras, the atmosphere in the room became so hushed you could hear the clack-clack-clack of the beads bashing together on a mixed material coat as it passed by. The jewelry, handmade by Ashish from discarded woodprint blocks and other objects he had picked up here and there, clacked and thwacked satisfyingly too. Near the end, a witchy woman held aloft a branch from which streamed incense smoke. Ashish had quoted the \u201csex guru\u201d and meditation cult leader Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (aka Osho) on his press release, and the back of one black sweatshirt featured 19 suggestions (all of which began with the letter f) once made in a lecture by Rajneesh\u2019s right-hand woman, Ma Anand Sheela.

The opening looks in a metallic floral pliss\u00e9 that sometimes cocooned the body and sometimes furled up and out into space were, like so many pieces here, meant to express the movement of the body in dance. The safari-like looks were a gentle reference to the colonized context of the dances in South America (under Spanish rule) and Japan (under the US, post-war) that Chalayan had been especially interested in. The trenchcoat with three rods, each nearly three feet or so, inserted in each arm was an experiment in dynamic potential of movement in the limbs. Lightly printed foliage dresses in fabric pulled taut by hoops were again solid sketches of motion, and the branded walking sticks were a bit of an aside into support. As Chalayan said, and often says, the themes behind his collections are not the point but merely part of his process in making the product. Here, there were many strong final examples of them. Dress number 14 for instance, a loose blue piece gathered at the midriff, felt like no great statement. Its origin seemed unrelated to that theme, but its beauty prompted your eye to dance across it nonetheless. Whatever the complications of his cerebral twists and turns, at the end of it Chalayan always services his original passion: the clothes."}, {"Designer": "Emilia Wickstead", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "When Jo March tells Laurie Laurence she wishes big hats were in fashion so she could protect her face from the sun, he delivers some top-drawer dressing advice. \u201cWhy mind the fashion?

It wasn\u2019t that this was a literal\u2014or at least overly literal\u2014take on 1860s attire but more that in Alcott, and the on-herself-based character of Jo, Wickstead found a kindred spirit. Alcott lived in hidebound times in which propriety was paramount. Wickstead is a very proper designer: Her clothes are for sure made to appear ladylike, perhaps sometimes even tantamount to prim, but what the designer relayed today was that under even the most apparently put-together and fashion-minding exterior can beat the heart of an iconoclast. Electrically toned gingham shirting shapes split south from the collar to reveal the navel without ever going so de trop as to do anything more than bolster the bosom. Caped-hem evening dresses in boiled-candy shades ballooned as if steroid enhanced at the arm. A ruched, puff-shoulder dress with a full skirt that fell in vertical lines of pink and orange was almost sickly but certainly sweet. This collection took conventional, classic lady dressing and pushed it to a beyond that made you question the starting point. The blancmange trio at the finale was perhaps too much, and we have seen these hyper-volumized soft scoop excesses too often elsewhere recently for them to feel fresh. But when Wickstead added a harness to an otherwise horse-trial-appropriate look or raised the hem on her wide-kicked tailored pants to an extreme height, she captured the essence of poor rejected Laurie\u2019s sound advice: Don\u2019t mind the fashion.

Anyone who isn\u2019t of a Celtic European background or indeed a folklore specialist would not have had a single inkling about the wellspring of Rocha\u2019s latest collection. There were many left openmouthed and clueless in the postshow congregation backstage. Nevertheless, among the mesmerizing visuals\u2014the delicate blue-and-white ruffles and the echoes of starchy tablecloths, net curtains, and doilies\u2014there were hints of something raw and ritualistic: blasts of folk music, straw sashes, crocheted raffia, a peculiar woven 3D symbol hanging from girls\u2019 shoulders. Come showtime one never has to hunt too far to feel the shadow of something dark among the prettiness at Simone Rocha. On the surface this was truly one of her prettiest collections, what with its trapezoid volumes, sheer leg-o\u2019-mutton sleeves, shirting smocks, and eyelet-edged cuffs. Lovely palette too: after the china prints came sugar pink, dark red, and faded chintzy antique prints. Shown in the round\u2014the stage of a flaking theater at Alexandra Palace\u2014you caught the profiles of bubble dresses, new silhouettes ballooning outward to be gathered in at knee level. A swift trawl of the internet gleans something of the deeply rooted pre-Christian wren-boy tradition\u2014the day-after-Christmas parade when men dress in straw outfits, vie to capture a wren, and knock on neighborhood doors to demand money. Some of the girls in Rocha\u2019s show had wren feathers painted on their foreheads. The burgeoning straw became basket bags. The new ballooning silhouettes\u2014kind indeed to womanly bodies\u2014were nevertheless gleaned from a sinister thought: \u201cthe outline of the bird,\u201d said Rocha. Once she said it, you saw: the profile of a bird\u2019s crop and tail, blown up, in motion. Retrofitting what is seen in a fashion show with knowledge of a designer\u2019s inspirations isn\u2019t strictly necessary. This collection is what it is: a multilayered treasury of signature Rocha clothes, satin ballet slippers, sparkly headdresses, and summer raffia bags. Pointing to something that is ancient, Irish, and unknown across the water in England may or may not have significance in these times of Brexit.

(Bear with me, there\u2019s a method to this madness.) Victoria Beckham was up after Margaret Howell, and outside her show was a quiet and respectful demonstration from the London chapter of Extinction Rebellion. Pre\u2013London shows, there was plenty of chatter about the eco-activist group shutting down the city\u2019s Fashion Week. So far that hasn\u2019t happened, but truth be told does it even need to? Anyone attending the run of Spring 2020 shows can\u2019t not be thinking about the environmental impact of fashion and what it means to be seeing new clothes at a time when we\u2019re consuming and discarding at an ever faster clip. There\u2019s a growing sense that whatever we buy from now on\u2014and a moment of unflinching, cold-light-of-day reality here: continue to buy we will\u2014had better come with some value, some staying power, some sense of it making a meaningful contribution to our wardrobes. This brings us to\u2014you knew we\u2019d get there eventually\u2014Margaret Howell, a designer whose long-standing raison d\u2019\u00eatre has been to go slow and steady while others around her were losing their heads going fast and frenetic. Her collection for next season, regardless of whether it\u2019s for women or for men (she showed both on her runway, at the Rambert dance school in the shadow of the National Theatre), demonstrated yet again her enviably strong and definitive handwriting\u2014utilitarian, tailored, unfussy\u2014which, by its thoughtful and considerate inclusivity, allows for all sorts of individual entry points into her look. Hers is a vocabulary of clothes\u2014the trench, the shirt, the blazer\u2014she reexamines and reinvents by fractional degrees, the easier to keep and make your own. For Spring 2020 that means plenty of suiting, with higher buttoning; looser-cut jackets worn with tapering trousers tucked into slouchy socks and flat leather sandals; and other times substantially collared shirts atop fluid Bermuda shorts, again with the omnipresent socks-and-sandals combo. Often they came out in mirror-image gender pairings, effectively the same outfit on a guy, then a girl, or vice versa. Howell has long presented the case for the notion of gender irrelevance, prioritizing a sense of naturalness and comfort over the artifice and affect of fashion; so the olive cotton parka on a guy was cut with the same swinging ease as a drop-waisted dress worn by a woman. There was also a terrific \u201950s abstract linear print that evoked the work of textile designer Lucienne Day, whose graphic patterns appeared at another time when Britain was undergoing a moment of profound change and self-examination. Who\u2019s to say if there wasn\u2019t a sly nod to the current landscape of the United Kingdom as it renegotiates where it is in the world, but the one certainty is that Howell\u2019s clothes exuded a sense of relevance and realness to our lives today. Any one of the looks in this show could have walked straight off the runway onto the street\u2014and last for years to come. Right now that feels like the very best way to be and no higher compliment to pay."}, {"Designer": "Victoria Beckham", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "When you think about it, the landscape of fashion is populated with female British designers and self-starting fashion entrepreneurs, and Victoria Beckham graduated to that disparate sisterhood a decade ago. Happy anniversary, VB! Only today people scurried to make her show in the middle of a Londonwide circuit that included Simone Rocha, Margaret Howell, Emilia Wickstead, and Phoebe English. Their common denominator? Being certain and direct, each in her own way. The Victoria Beckham way? Enveloping women in empathy, attainable easy-chic solutions, and the charming force field of her self-irony. For Spring, Beckham\u2019s options were essentially whittled down to neat-and-together tailoring with a slight \u201970s flavor and flowy, waist-free silk ankle-length dresses. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of focus on dresses,\u201d said Beckham in a preview at her West London HQ. \u201cI like the ruffles that dance as you\u2019re moving. There\u2019s a lot of volume. The patterns are much more complicated, but they feel very light and flattering\u2014you feel very little in them.\u201d In the olden days of Victoria Beckham, feeling \u201cvery little\u201d meant being encased in power-meshed body-con knee-length dresses. (See how far she\u2019s come by checking out her first show, reviewed by Nicole Phelps in 2009.) With time Beckham has gone with the general flow (which is now very liberatingly flowy, thanks to the influence of Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino), while always\u2014to her credit\u2014scrutinizing why and how any garment translates as practicable and relatable to a laywoman. She has that rationale down pat now, and it\u2019s instructive. \u201cThe silhouettes aren\u2019t complicated, so I like to express myself by wearing color,\u201d she said. \u201cI only used to wear black when I was younger, and I never understood when certain people used to say they didn\u2019t like you wearing black. But then I got it\u2014color is so much more flattering!\u201d It was a hot September day, and the audience couldn\u2019t help but fixate on the vibrant airiness of the dresses Beckham dealt out singly in vibrant purple, leaf green, lemon, cinnamon, or pale beige. \u201cIf I can give women the confidence to wear greens and purples or windowpane checks, I think it\u2019s great,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes you feel so good and confident.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Roland Mouret", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Backstage before his really rather wonderful Spring 2020 show, Roland Mouret came to chat for a moment, clutching a hanger. He held it up. \u201cAfter the Galaxy, this,\u201d he said, raising the hanger a little higher to be in the line of vision, \u201cis going to be the biggest thing for me. It\u2019s my baby.\u201d To be clear, there was nothing on said hanger, no Galaxy redux, the career-defining dress that women went crazy for\u2014really, really crazy for\u2014more than a decade ago. But in the time since Mouret designed that dress, well, we all know what has happened. We live and breathe and think about it every single day\u2014the terrible rise of populist, far-right politics; current and impending climate catastrophe; a crueler era\u2014and designers, well Mouret at least, are not immune to all the same stuff we drive ourselves to distraction thinking about. That hanger is something Mouret developed with a company called Arch & Hook. It\u2019s sustainable. Eighty percent of it is manufactured out of recycled marine plastics, a positive step in fighting the environmental impact made by so many aspects of the fashion industry. It\u2019s one thing he can do\u2014has done\u2014to make a difference. And potentially quite a huge difference at that, when you consider how many hangers end up as landfill. Mouret has always been a designer who is many things, as instinctual as he is thoughtful, as pragmatic as he is a sensualist. The rapidly evolving and devolving world around him is something he feels an unavoidable duty to respond to. \u201cYou wake up in the morning as a designer,\u201d he said during that backstage chat, \u201cand think, How am I going to design another outfit? What\u2019s the point of it? Even if we love our jobs, we can\u2019t avoid that question. And at the end of the day, it comes back to people. We love people.\u201d And this is where the counterpoint to the seriousness of his sustainability initiative with the hanger comes in. Mouret understands that the clothes we wear, the clothes suspended from those very hangers, still need to touch us heart, mind, and soul, perhaps now more than ever. For all the weightiness of the times we live in, Mouret responded with lightness and loveliness. The former could be seen in the fabrics, with shimmering aqueous celadon sequins rendered as a sinuous second-skin dress or a jacket casually thrown over the arm of a diaphanous navy shirt and slouchy lilac trousers. Crumpled, relaxed Berber striped cottons were used for a shirtdress with a matching cross-body hammock bag, or for a rather inventive new pants shape which echoed pajamas, the hems wrapped and knotted at the ankles. As to the latter, the loveliness, it was all about the silhouette: softer, gentler, easier; a response, Mouret said, to draping fabric so his clothes can work for everyone, whatever their shape, size, or gender. As with last season, he showed on all sorts of gorgeous gals, a convincing exercise in body positivity, and quite a few guys too. Mouret\u2019s always had a knack of empathizing with those wearing his clothes\u2014the Galaxy dress from all those years ago was proof of that\u2014but for Spring, that ability of his saw him excel."}, {"Designer": "Duro Olowu", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Duro Olowu is well known for dressing women in the art world. The muses he looks to for inspiration reflect the discerning tastes of his stylish clientele. This season he drew on the work of Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, who is perhaps most famous for being Picasso\u2019s romantic partner, though the 97-year-old French painter, art critic, and author is a creative force in her own right. Olowu came across a recently reissued collection of her travel sketches, and her colorful impressions of India, Senegal, and Italy from the late \u201970s and early \u201980s informed his new collection. The soft pale blue and green tones of a belted cropped jacket and maxi skirt with gently ruffled hem were evocative of the faded yet glorious frescoes you find in Venice, a nice counterpoint to the rich, saturated palette that is Olowu\u2019s signature. One particularly eye-catching coat in that series was spliced with panels of pale pink made from vintage interior fabric that Olowu came across on a trip to Lille, in northern France. It was upcycling done with a sophisticated hand. The designer has been working a more graphic line into his repertoire of expressive prints lately too, and this season there was an array of micro-stripe motifs collaged to flattering effect along trench coats and bias-cut silk satin dresses. In addition to Gilot\u2019s sketches, Olowu was also looking at the photography of Beth Lesser, especially her fantastic images of the Jamaican scene of the 1980s. The wide-leg suiting in primary colors and slouchy pajama sets had an attitude and sense of ease that was straight out of the dancehall. Olowu is a master of mixed-media dressing, and for Spring there were several terrific examples to choose from, including a languid silk georgette frock tiered with several painterly floral layers. Beyond the familiar evening silhouettes, the new apron shape with double straps and pockets jutting out at the hip cut a striking figure. With its darkly romantic assemblage of brocades, the piece offered an arresting and modern portrait of a lady."}, {"Designer": "David Koma", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "There\u2019s nothing quite like watching a model powerfully strut by in a sequined, zebra-stripe catsuit at 10 a.m. on a Sunday. Amplified by the dozen women in crystal cocktail frocks in the front row, it was a sight to jolt even the most passive, dismissive viewer out of the real world and into the world of fashion. It\u2019s there that David Koma thrives. The designer works in the old method of singular inspiration and variations on a theme, taking a trip to Kenya as the jumping-off point for his collection of elaborate beadwork, sequined fringe, and raffia ruffles. He went so far as to make jewelry and belt buckles in the shape of zebras and rhinos, leaving last season\u2019s butterflies and ruffs forgotten in the past. It\u2019s this devotion to a motif that can make Koma\u2019s work lean too heavily into costume, resulting in collections that exclusively provide the sort of party frocks intended for post-10 p.m. life. Where Koma thrives is in his construction; his bustiers and corsets are so tight and curved they function as a second skin. (No wonder they\u2019re a favorite in Hollywood.) For Spring, beadwork and embellishment were deeply considered, as usual, as were the many darts and slices that cut into Koma\u2019s denim daywear\u2014a welcome addition to his cocktail-centric oeuvre. Were we to take the beige sequined trench as him staking a claim to 9-to-5 dressing? Not quite, according to the designer, though it would be something smart to consider.

Nobody conveyed the mood better than Luka Sabbat, who slouched and slumped down the runway in a washed black jumpsuit, emoting an exacting I-don\u2019t-give-a attitude at the bright hour of 9:00 a.m.\u2014if anyone could sell this vision of leisure life, it was him. Zinko had a larger point to her collection, though, about sustainability. Much of her fabrications were leftovers from past seasons or recollected from thrift stores. She used vintage bandanas to make knotted tops, trousers, and suiting, and built pockets into everything so that one could carry a reusable water bottle or a packed salad wherever one goes. The effort is valiant, especially considering Extinction Rebellion\u2019s protests and demonstrations throughout London Fashion Week this season. For a designer of Zinko\u2019s means to get serious about environmentalism is really saying something, though what she said herself says it all.

In Nichol\u2019s daughter\u2019s case, she sees color when she reads numbers or letters. This was the starting point for the designer\u2019s very personal collection, which she mostly constructed on her own. Nichol\u2019s clothes this season are a bit crafty, and she is deeply proud of them. At the preview for Spring 2020, she spoke about asking her daughter to read the colors of her muses\u2019 names.

The garments themselves are beautiful, not only because of the handiwork in the mismatched top stitching and the delicate bows and ruffles decorating the backs and necklines, but also because they are, as a group, a departure from Nichol\u2019s typically goth-like work. She did design a new line of black leather hats and bags, as well as a cropped leather jacket with ankle-length fringe, but mostly this new collection had a dreamier, more romantic approach.

I\u2019m fascinated by people\u2019s lives. And I want my clothes to live in their lives, and their wardrobes.\u201d Rejina Pyo said this after her show, yet there\u2019s no doubt her clothes are highly crafted, highly curated, and highly conceptualized\u2014and sometimes that means fantasy. Thus, tonight\u2019s collection did contain a few fantasy twists that would be hard to translate to real women\u2019s lives\u2014most notably, the two skirts skirted with undulating triple handles that Pyo said were a take on glass blowing, and the crushed, oversize millinery. The vast majority of it, however, was indeed shaped to fit in everyday existence while simultaneously elevating it. Before we veered into the punchy orange check dress and suit, or the wonderful vertically gathered puckered silk orange dress worn under a backward-button trench shirt, there was a meaningful section of appealing looks often featuring deep, square necklines joined by Pyo\u2019s mixed-up, hand-carved buttons. All these pieces were in neutral shades, often in linen; rather than shouting weakly of fantasy unrealized, they whispered potently of reality enhanced. This collection was also notable for introducing a \u201cunisex\u201d element, which Pyo\u2019s notes said was designed to be shared. It was mostly modeled on men here, and in fact, you could have maybe just have cut to the chase and called it menswear. Hawaiian printed or patched mixed-wash denim, muted color shackets, and gently appealing knit polos were part of what felt like a far more tentative version of the reality Pyo is realizing in her true-life vision of for-women\u2014not \u201cunisex\u201d\u2014clothing. One real-life influence for Pyo was the 90-something White Cube artist Etel Adnan. Pyo said: \u201cI was thinking of how at that point in your life, how free you would be to express yourself, not really thinking about other things, because you are at the point of mortality and that gives you ultimate freedom . . . that really inspired me.\u201d So did she design this collection as if it could be her last? \u201cNo! It was more about being true to yourself and enjoying life.\u201d While the womenswear expressed a spirit both emboldened and at liberty, the men\u2019s, for now, felt a bit mutedly hidebound.

Her magical creations are also unmatched in the fashion sphere for their haunting beauty and carefully wrought craftsmanship. Findikoglu\u2019s popularity and profits are thanks to her uncompromising aesthetic taste; the world she has created in her name is one where history and historical dress fuse with artistry, the occult, the supernatural, and the perverse. For many designers, this would be enough: to have a cult following (literally) and be among the wisest, most inspired young designers in the game. But Findikoglu is intent on doing more with her label. For Spring 2020, she created a mass ritual to summon awareness about climate change, complete with a poem, talismanic structures, and a peace sign stamped on to the wall of her show space in what seemed to be blood. Communing with nature and its spirits has been crucial to Findikoglu\u2019s work since day one, but now she is putting her creative energy where her mouth is, so to speak. She estimates that 60 to 75 percent of her collection shown on the catwalk today was sustainably made, using up-cycled vintage garments or handmade techniques from her native Turkey to eliminate waste. Her moir\u00e9 skirts, in shades of dusty rose, were hand-woven and dyed in Turkey by a women\u2019s collective, resulting in variance in the colors between bolts of fabric. That irregularity played into the design, with Findikoglu staggering waistbands and hems to reflect the fragmented nature of her materials. Elsewhere, she turned studio scraps into three-dimensional floral embellishments and turned vintage skirts into a lively cape worn with some of the store tags still hanging. Her dedication to sustainability led her to examine the work of her spiritual predecessor Vivienne Westwood. The two are quite kindred spirits, equally passionate about the environment and firm in their distinctive style. If a male model with \u201cVivienne Says Buy Less\u201d scrawled on his chest in red lipstick was the obvious homage to Dame Viv, Findikoglu\u2019s mini crinis, deconstructed gray check suiting, and subversively sexy button-off trousers were the more niche ties to Westwood\u2019s oeuvre. But saving the planet and talking to the spirit world wasn\u2019t enough, either. Findikoglu also issued herself a surprising design challenge this season: assess the waist. Since the start of her brand, she has built most of her garments to be tightly cinched by corset, darts, or belt to accentuate the female form. For Spring 2020, she spoke about rethinking the area from the sternum to the hipbone, letting it be wild, unencumbered, and free. Backstage after the show, she motioned to the model wearing her first look: A red cross top and low-slung blue jacquard skirt. \u201cThis elongated skinny look is something I have never done before, and I\u2019m pleased that I can still make it look theatrical but minimal at the same time,\u201d she said. In addition to the many hip-hugging skirts, Findikoglu also cropped her corsets to look more like breastplates, accentuating the midsection and letting it breathe. It\u2019s there, of course, between the ribs and the hips that life is born, which is perhaps why one model came out with a baby clad in black frills harnessed to her torso. \u201cThere are a lot of fresh shapes in this collection that I have never explored before,\u201d Findikoglu continued. \u201cI\u2019m quite proud of myself.\u201d The feeling is much deserved."}, {"Designer": "Toga", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "\u201cI wanted to invest more time into producing unnecessary things and see what would come out of the process.

Notably unnecessary were the pieces featuring body-cladding paracord mesh which made the models resemble ensnared marine life in discarded netting, flipping and flapping fatedly across the runway for breath. Yet, on the whole, Furuta\u2019s experiments in the uncalled-for produced liberatingly twisted innovation. The show was held at the Royal Institute of British Architects, and here Furuta fittingly set about her work both totally au fait with the established facades of clothing and with a total determination to disrupt them. A vaguely dull, businesslike opening of executive-touched workwear was enlivened by oversize arms and cutouts. A similarly cut out blue brocade dress was padded with spongy panels of frothing ruffle. The collar and placket of an otherwise uninteresting white work shirt were spiked with twisted metal pins. Controversially, a few looks bordered on the conventional, such as a tailored olive pant below a scarfed and soft tailored navy blazer.

Halpern stands out in London as a young designer who seriously specializes in non-ironic full-on eveningwear\u2014he\u2019s found his market in the United States, the Middle East, and anywhere there are women who will go all-out in the glamour stakes. What he has going for him is a widening repertoire of shapes which give an equal share of options across generations and body types. It\u2019s not just corseted tops and disco flares anymore; now, there are generous volumes, capes, and a showstopper which was created from masses of micro-pleaded animal-print chiffon."}, {"Designer": "Molly Goddard", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "From the moment she appeared on the London scene five years ago, Molly Goddard has been synonymous with an ethereal kind of romanticism. The light, airy tulle layers on which this designer has built her brand, however, belie a steely design focus. And today, she showed her mettle with her most confident and exquisite collection to date. Nearly always voluminous and often ruffled, Goddard\u2019s signatures are unmistakable; in fact, you can almost recognize the rustle of her clothes with your eyes closed. Such was the case at her show this afternoon, where models in full-skirted looks literally brushed past editors and buyers sat in tightly packed rows. In a moment when experiences have taken a backseat to fashion, it was an intimate reminder that nothing beats the frisson of carefully considered clothing. Rather than conjure some elaborate theme, Goddard spent her time refining her technical know-how for Spring. The main goal was to find ways to blow up the silhouettes that have become familiar in her repertoire without any hidden tricks or underpinnings. The new pieces appeared effortlessly light, buoyed by new pattern-cutting techniques and expert layering with sheer ruched dresses that alluded to skin worn over billowing ankle-length skirts. There was a charming allure to the more casual looks as well, including the sweaters tied with ribbon that revealed a sliver of the upper arm, paired with micro-floral-printed bubble skirts that were gently raised over one knee. After the unapologetic nakedness on the New York shows, this subtle brand of seduction was especially persuasive. Goddard worked with denim for the first time this season, though the results were far from basic. Embellished with 3-D flowers and cut to the ankle in ever-increasing circles, the raw denim frock carried all the lightness of her tulle looks. Though Goddard doesn\u2019t plan on launching accessories just yet, the new studded crossbody bags were another reminder of her range. Whatever move she decides to make next, surely sky\u2019s the limit for this talented young designer."}, {"Designer": "Sharon Wauchob", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Sharon Wauchob has been in experimentation mode since she moved to London from Paris a few years ago. After presenting at men\u2019s Fashion Week last June, she staged her first show on the women\u2019s schedule in London today at a light-filled church in Marylebone. The Irish designer cut her teeth on Savile Row, and in that sense, the idea of gender-fluidity comes naturally. So it came as no surprise to see Pose star Billy Porter sitting front row at her show. Since his groundbreaking turn in a tuxedo dress at the Oscars, the actor has shaken up the idea of red carpet dressing, bringing a sense of play and creative expression to Hollywood, where rules are rarely broken. His eye was immediately drawn to the sheer shirting and trench coats that were finished with draped scarves across the chest and worn by male, female, and gender non-binary models on the runway. With a cross-generational lineup of friends and family that included artists, writers, dancers, and veteran runway stars such as Jacquetta Wheeler, Wauchob\u2019s casting stood out from the shows in London where runways still tend to be populated by new faces. Though the collection itself wasn\u2019t radically new in its offering, that human element brought a welcome soulfulness and sense of reality to her evening clothes. The couture techniques she\u2019s been refining for the past few seasons in her atelier held sway in the context of a runway presentation.

I\u2019ll take the liberty of condensing what the couple said in their Hackney Road studio: It\u2019s what they do with denim\u2014they were the ones who triggered the whole holey, shredded jeans trend with their first show in 2010\u2014and then asymmetrical sloppy knits, and subsequently, a cool kind of glamour that\u2019s wearable on the street. Above all that, however, their main community pull is that they stand for the right of young women to take up more space in the world. They gave over the beginning of their show to the video-screened thoughts of some of those M\u2019A girls, the diverse gang of friends and models who they\u2019ve gathered through their online enterprise. They\u2019d simply asked them to imagine what they\u2019d want to tell their daughters of the future. The unrehearsed answers\u2014an effective, reflexive device for verbalizing what we should all recognize in ourselves\u2014were incredibly moving to watch. An approximate sampling, scribbled down in the moment: \u201cYou find happiness when you discover what\u2019s special about yourself,\u201d said someone. \u201cShe is very loved, no matter what she thinks,\u201d said another. \u201cThis is my body forever, so love it,\u201d offered a third. Occupying our rightful space\u2014well, that\u2019s a bigger issue than the clothes we wear, but how good when fashion converts itself into a platform for powering it onwards. In this show, there were indeed space-occupying shapes: big, strapless bubbles; long, large skirts springing from the waist; swaggering, size-ignoring taffeta coats and brocade suits. The go-to Marques\u2019Almeida jeans, too, have turned wide and high-waisted, and super-wantable in black or red, or their classic blue. Above and beyond style, for today\u2019s generation, it\u2019s genuine values that will make the difference in attracting and keeping loyalty. When there\u2019s so much stuff to choose between today, \u2018community\u2019 means something far deeper than concocting marketing lip service\u2014even when it gets to feminism, new generations are increasingly quick to smell out algorithmic rats. So to the question that every citizen-consumer is asking now: What about the issue of sustainability\u2014particularly around the denim production which is at the core of Marques\u2019Almeida? Will there be rivers running black, red, green, and blue if we buy their jeans? Not now, pledged Almeida. \u201cWe\u2019re using an Ozone Denim factory.

Though the stylist and former creative director of Interview has major fashion credentials\u2014the list of brands he has worked with behind the scenes is extensive and includes Alexander Wang, Valentino, and Christian Dior, to name a few\u2014this marks his first time in the driving seat as designer. That said, his appointment isn\u2019t the first of its kind. As the fashion landscape reorders itself, designers from markedly nontraditional backgrounds are coming to the fore: Rihanna and Victoria Beckham come to mind, not to mention the famous twin sisters of stealth style behind The Row. And with emerging labels like Colville, cocreated by former British Vogue fashion director Lucinda Chambers, and Wardrobe.NYC from Australian Vogue\u2019s Christine Centenera, a new generation of editor turned designers is making their mark. For Templer, the mission at Ports was to re-examine the most familiar things in a woman\u2019s wardrobe, starting with shirt dressing. Where you\u2019d normally expect a stylist to take a reductive approach, Templer pushed a distinctive maximalism from the first look with a silk maxidress that was collaged with Matisse-inspired prints on one side and soft pleats on the other. That sense of exuberance continued through to pajama suits that were spliced with different floral panels and zebra prints of varying scale. The traditional two-piece suit was reimagined as a jumpsuit or layered up in unexpected ways. In fact, it was sometimes difficult to tell where one pair of pants ended and another began. Taken apart, the simplest remixed staples resonated the most, like a trench coat cut with a red check motif along one arm. Ports is not a brand known for its accessories, though Templer is hoping to change that. The sensible yet eye-catching low-heeled sandals and double-sided handbags had a compelling real world appeal. As the conversation around who creates fashion is expanding, an equally important one is happening around the depiction of who wears those clothes. With that in mind, it would have been nice to see a surprise beyond the straightforward model casting on the runway at Ports today."}, {"Designer": "Warm", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Is there anything better than golden hour in the summer? Maybe one thing: golden hour on the beach. To the uninitiated, it\u2019s that perfect time of day just before sunset, when the light is soft and glowy, the air is still warm, and the sky looks like a painting. Warm\u2019s Winnie Beattie, who spent most of her summer surfing in Amagansett, New York, with her three boys, says that golden hour always fills her with a sense of anticipation: There\u2019s usually a dinner or beach party to go to, or maybe just a calm evening at home. She was thinking about those relaxed, happy feelings when she designed Spring, and she lifted the palette from her own photographs of Hamptons sunsets. The print she engineered for her first look blended shades of blush, lavender, and peach, mimicking the sky before sunset; later in the collection, it deepened to violet and navy, the colors of \u201cblue hour,\u201d when the sun has dipped far below the horizon. Color is an important part of Beattie\u2019s design process; her customers come to her for unusual combinations (like this season\u2019s ruffled blouse in turquoise, orange, and lilac), patchworked florals, and vintage-inspired tropical motifs. They\u2019re unlike the prints you see elsewhere and lend an emotional, gotta-have-it quality to Beattie\u2019s easy, wearable silhouettes. That\u2019s why Spring\u2019s departures were the solid pieces, like an acid-wash tangerine jean and a white sleeveless shirtdress with multicolored smocking around the waist. Beattie said the detail reminded her of what she wore as a kid, and the vaguely preppy silhouette was new for Warm, too. She wanted to bring in a few classic touches without getting into fussy, country club territory; a similar button-front dress in nubby cream-colored raw silk nailed the elegant, yet beachy balance nicely."}, {"Designer": "Markus Lupfer", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "This collection was shot alongside a large, melting ice cube to symbolize both environmental concerns and the heat Markus Lupfer wanted its wearers to beat next summer. The designer concedes that he has not been among the first to put sustainable practice to the fore, but he is moving in that direction. This collection contained organic cotton T-shirts, and more, he promised, is to follow. The designs on those T-shirts were circling dolphins, part of an aquatic-themed collection. Prints included an \u201cunderwater garden\u201d print (basically fish among flowers) and a cute school-of-fish print. These were deployed on light white viscose sundresses, or patched onto crispy poplin shirts or printed in appealing color combinations on irregular pleat patch crepe day dresses. Fictional Lupfer marine-resort patches were stitched onto the pockets of pink or khaki drawstringed work shirts in corduroy, which were hung alongside matching carpenter\u2019s pants. The designer had reworked his lip logo into a broderie anglaise, used winningly in wide skirts or as patched high capelets on T-shirts."}, {"Designer": "Vivienne Westwood", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "This season Vivienne Westwood opted not to show this second line with all the accompanying brouhaha a Westwood show entails, but to instead let the clothes do the talking. This was a good call, because during a speed date in her Conduit Street showroom, they proved themselves extremely articulate. True, it was Westwood\u2019s highly capable (and just as highly heeled) rep, Laura McCuaig, who let us know that between Fall 2017\u2019s collection and this one, the amount of styles in this coed collection have been reduced by 50 percent in womenswear and 32 percent in men\u2019s. This was to emphasize that when Westwood tells us to buy less, she is also being sure to make less (although McCuaig did not have a sense of whether the overall amount of pieces produced has been similarly slashed). The collection was an artful mishmash. Westwood\u2019s main inspiration was apparently the stand-up theater of Italy\u2019s commedia dell\u2019arte as well as the also Italian, but more recent, character of Pinocchio, Carlo Collodi\u2019s lying puppet. Had Westwood been in the room, I would have expected a lengthy reference to Boris Johnson at this point. However, as mentioned, this evening it was all clothes and no soapbox. Pinocchio somehow led to the irregular circles that reappeared here and there throughout the collection, sometimes colored in on a hand-scrawled Sharpie print on deconstructed shirt-shifts, sometimes overlaid on digitally printed Dutch Delft china and fruit still-life digital prints. Some really interesting dresses in shirting cotton were made in fractured shards of paneling that recalled broken glass. A construction system termed \u201ccocoon\u201d saw more panels of shirting fabric, this time organically circular and shirred at the seam, interconnected to make suggestively oversize collage garments that added cup size and bolstered hip and fairly winked a come-hither hello at you from the mannequin. Also entertaining was the so-called drunken tartan pieces for both genders that took that venerable Scottish pattern but gave it the woozy skew-whiff aspect of a one Scotch too many. Another wantable were the updated \u201calien\u201d pants with a drooping waistline saved by an internal corseted cinch at the navel. I could give you the blah blah blah on the various sustainable attributes of the rayon, cotton, linen, and more in this collection, all of which was outlined\u2014as usual recently\u2014in the excellently thorough accompanying document. Just suffice it to say that while Westwood\u2019s rhetoric can be jumbled to the extent that it pollutes the message she is so dedicated to spreading, there is no question that when it comes to production, she practices what she preaches."}, {"Designer": "Hillier Bartley", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Bourgeois dress codes have been making a comeback lately, mostly of the Parisian, 1970s variety. Hillier Bartley is proposing a decidedly English take on that idea for Spring, partly inspired by Lady Diana. Though it\u2019s been over 20 years since her untimely passing, the number of tribute accounts dedicated to the princess and her style is only growing. Indeed, that distinctive mix of fashion classics (Ferragamo pumps, pie-crust blouses) and athletic basics (cycling shorts, baseball caps) appears to be more relevant than ever. Fast becoming a signature for the label, the Hillier Bartley mom jeans were very much in Diana\u2019s wheelhouse, and this season they came with a cool mock-croc leather waistband. Add to that a number of other chic wardrobe staples, including a merino turtleneck sweater in pale pink, a simple white monogram pocket tee, and a crisp black shirtdress that wouldn\u2019t be wildly out of place in Kate Middleton\u2019s wardrobe. Elsewhere, a more anarchic spirit won out. Hillier Bartley is known for its subversive tailoring, and for Spring it was best exemplified by a double-breasted Prince of Wales\u2013check suit with eye-catching zig-zag fringing across the back. The matching fringed tuxedo pants were a showstopper even sans blazer, and they looked especially good with one of the brand\u2019s asymmetrical long-sleeved white shirts, a punkish silhouette that first emerged for Fall. Accessories designer Katie Hiller has been slowly building out the brand\u2019s handbag business, and the new triple-pocket structured style hit the sweet spot between ladylike and utilitarian. Designed to be worn two-by-two and finished with sparkling gold chains, the label\u2019s new belts are the kind of instantly transformative pieces that will easily carry into the new season."}, {"Designer": "RTA", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Much of what Eli Azran does at RtA can be classified as \u201cgoing-out\u201d clothes.

But Azran, who was a CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Finalist in 2017, isn\u2019t only dressing one kind of woman. At his Spring 2020 presentation in New York, he spoke about versatility and sportswear. Azran\u2019s latest collection definitely nods to the Pretty Young Thing nightlife scene with the black and white leather one-shoulder micro-minidresses and the red zebra prints, but this season he focused a bit more on everyday separates and his tailoring skills. The paper-bag pants and skirt silhouettes made an impression, as did the boyfriend-cut jean shorts and very L.A.-ish plaid button-down shirts. The blazers were nicely cut, and the denim offering was strong. Cool-girl dresses and tops were well represented, but where Azran excelled this season was with his more approachable pieces."}, {"Designer": "J.

There were no nods to trends here, or silhouettes that others are doing. It was pure Mendel in execution and conception. The starting point was Venetian glass, which shares with Mendel\u2019s work weightlessness, transparency, and intricate detailing. (His father was a Venetian glass collector.) One of the lightest looks was a white mesh-patterned tulle enlivened by hand embellishments of cord and beads. Classic and undeniably pretty was a pleated pink dress with an enormous bow at the empire waist. For daytime there were white lace dresses to wear with sandals or over pants and, unexpectedly, some smashing print dresses. The purest expression of Mendel\u2019s craft, and most resonant with his Venetian theme, was a black dress with beaded horsehair appliqu\u00e9s topped by a cape bolero that would be the belle of any ball."}, {"Designer": "Marta Jakubowski", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Marta Jakubowski\u2019s notes told of a strong woman striding out \u201cwith determination in her step.\u201d Making the best of a bleak situation is self-evidently the theme of our times. This young feminist\u2019s recommendation is that we might do it while armed with lavender power-shoulders, multi-draped tailoring, and minds fixed on Marlene Dietrich. It\u2019s always good to think about Dietrich at any time, but especially now: a self-invented goddess of high glamour and gender transgressor who rose above the horrors of fascism and war in Europe. For Jakubowski, who is Polish but was raised in Germany before coming to finish her education at the Royal College of Art in London, Dietrich might have a special resonance; her reinterpretation of Dietrich\u2019s classic movie star gowns concluded the show. Technical cutting skills are very much a strength of German fashion education, and Jakubowski has always used hers to subvert generic wardrobe templates. Sometimes that can lead her into a state where there\u2019s just too much going on to offer her peers the easy solutions needed for getting on with life. When she calms it down\u2014as she did with a white tuxedo coat-dress, for example\u2014the clarity shows her potential. What so many designers miss is the wide-open goal which yawns in the space Phoebe Philo once occupied at Celine. Disenfranchised Philophiles have money and very few young places to spend it. As soon as designers like Jakubowski wake up to the fact that they could fill in some of that gap, the better all round.

Taking inspiration from the state of Francis Bacon\u2019s studio at 7 Reece Mews\u2014a room that would have given Marie Kondo palpitations but of which Bacon said: \u201cI feel at home here in this chaos because the chaos suggests images to me\u201d\u2014Morena littered his own studio with artistic chaos and invited his models to pose as if for a painting. In a color palette inspired by the saturated tones of an Andalusian sunset, Morena brushed some compelling shapes: a fitted red jersey dress was violently zigzagged from shoulder to hip to hem with red ruffle; a flamenco-touched long spaghetti-strapped dress in scarlet lace became increasingly opaque as it fell to the ankle; a high-slit dress in soft blue organza lace was made from a bolt of material the designer had purchased but not used in a previous season, one of a few examples of repurposed pieces here; and a maroon dress in knitted organza panels was intersected by five contours of lace ruffle, while another in coral was sliced from the neck to the calf by another ruffle, this one in dramatically face-framing cream lace. Morena\u2019s creative chaos also contained some tailoring: high-cut jackets with dramatically full lace arms worn with pants cut to the ribcage, an interesting skirted purple evening pant, and a semi-sheer lace and lurex pajama suit.

Also like that one, the new offering wears its inspirations more lightly than it did in the past. You\u2019d have to look very closely to discern the origins of the prints. Designer Sofia Sanchez de Betak worked hard at abstracting and obscuring them. Either that or she worked in solids; the chalky pastels suit the season. It\u2019s smart to expand and evolve in a crowded market. What hasn\u2019t changed is the general aesthetic. These are dresses and easy pieces to pack for vacation getaways or to conjure that spirit without having to go through airport security. At a showroom appointment, Sanchez de Betak wore the lean jumpsuit that opens the look book. It\u2019s another nice development. Like the shirt dress that follows a few looks later, it has a more streamlined cut and mien\u2014lighter on the frills than other items here. Not that she\u2019s given up on the little details. A white cotton peasant dress was elaborately hand-embroidered in multicolor flowers\u2014so elaborately that Sanchez de Betak produced a print version more in keeping with Chufy\u2019s typical price range.

An ironic geographical swap in the current Brexit mess, if ever there was one.

It\u2019s sobering to think that there\u2019s a generation that has come to adulthood in the last three years who\u2019ve known almost nothing but scarily divisive times, and hardly surprising that Bovan was early on prefiguring dystopian scenarios in his shows. The secret of his charm, however, is that he\u2019s equally a reacher for jolly escapism, a believer in living in the country, and a new-generation practitioner of old-fashioned home crafts. \u201cTo be honest, there\u2019s something just around the corner that we all know will be quite severe,\u201d he commented. \u201cBut here we all are in London, making fabulous shows, which of course I love.\u201d Perhaps only such a mind can throw motocross trousers, military flight suits, ditsy Liberty florals, hospital scrubs, and thoughts of Bloomsbury Group Edwardiana into the melting pot. What came out of the melee was actually the cleanest, slickest collection he\u2019s ever made, proving that he can indeed cut a complicated pair of patchworked trousers and tailor a bomber jacket, as well as go all out with the wonky romanticism of the Liberty print dresses and puff-sleeved blouses he\u2019s made his own. Within it all, you could see quite clearly what will sell: that new design of trousers, the Liberty print skirt with a flippy hem made flippier by means of a boned hemline, the leg o\u2019 mutton\u2013sleeve tops, and quite possibly the flat lozenge-shaped bags he\u2019s fixed on belts.

Probably many have been deterred from going into business because of mounting levels of student debt\u2014and possibly the feeling that the standard runway show isn\u2019t the best way of starting up. Whatever\u2019s behind it, the situation points to the fact that the U.K. should be making an effort to retain the talent it has educated.

That daywear looked young, fresh, and jaunty and included pretty dresses in intensely printed poplins edged with embroidered detailing; attractive soft-washed structured denim dresses, shorts, jeans, and jackets (some printed); jersey kimonos; ruffled blouses galore; strap-backed jumpsuits and matching tailored jackets; and sparkling beaded lace dresses. Simpler, shorter, lighter, and cheaper only added up to a lesser collection if you were heavily committed to Temperley\u2019s evening pieces.

In late April, she received a call asking her to make the white sleeveless coat-dress that the Duchess of Sussex would wear to present newborn Archie to the world with Prince Harry on May 8. That royal endorsement came fast on the heels of her winning the BFC/Vogue Fashion Fund prize on May 1, and just weeks after she\u2019d shown her stellar Fall collection amid the exhibition she curated for the Serpentine Galleries. Next, it was off to New York to collaborate with Solange Knowles on a music and fashion \u201cdevotional\u201d happening as part of Frieze. In addition to all that, her collaboration with Maria Grazia Chiuri for the Dior Marrakech show\u2014the Bar jacket tailoring she worked on with the house\u2014happened too.

A preternaturally calm personality (related, perhaps, to a summer spent at a yoga retreat in Mongolia), Wales Bonner has also found time to produce a Spring collection. \u201cIt\u2019s called Mambo, the third in a series exploring spirituality,\u201d she explains, making a sound as if designing and making it was some kind of test. \u201cIn the last six months I needed time for introspection, to have more visibility on all aspects of my business and to clarify my vision. Having a lot of opportunities\u2014which I\u2019ve been lucky to have\u2014can be distracting from building foundations, and so I\u2019ve really appreciated having the headspace of being serious and practical.\u201d What she means is that there\u2019s a look book rather than a show this time, but one which does equal justice to the fact that she is steadily defining and refining her cut and the composition of her clothes. As ever, she\u2019d been set off by reading an academic work, this time by Robert Farris Thompson, a Yale professor who is an authority on Cuban mambo culture. \u201cSo I was looking at Cuban culture in the \u201940s and \u201950s, borrowing from a black ballet dancer\u2019s wardrobe, and military details, and elements of evening wear.\u201d What emerges in the hand is the detail\u2014the elevated sophistication of her slim track-tuxedo pants, the volume of her wide-leg trousers with their \u201coutside\u201d pockets and the contrasting running stitch on the outside seams, the way belts are covered with macram\u00e9, the tiny roses embroidered on the pintucks of a fitted shirt. Probably it is the still, considered nature of Wales Bonner that makes the contemplation of these nuances assume significance\u2014her way of capturing a certain glamour, but \u201calways in a minimalist way,\u201d as she puts it. Her developing expertise\u2014the time she\u2019s devoting to upgrading fit\u2014is apparent, too, in the womenswear. On her rail, the effects of her learnings from working with Dior\u2019s tailoring atelier were tangible in the curved, darted, torso-tracing shaping of jackets and a checked shirt\u2014echoes of the Bar design, made easy. What about the question of sustainability? This season\u2019s stretch fabrics inevitably involve polyester. But Wales Bonner is working on that. By the time she has her next show in January, she pledges she\u2019ll be producing her clothes \u201cin a fully sustainable Italian factory that Katharine Hamnett uses.\u201d Hamnett\u2014lest we forget\u2014was one of fashion\u2019s first sustainability pioneers.

Their starting point was Urania, a Greek goddess of astronomy and a symbol of the female connection with the ephemeral, emotional world. From there, they connected with the circle through the work of Rosie Grace Ward, having the artist build metal amulets to adorn the shoulders of their bias garments. (Ward\u2019s work also served as a set for their runway.) Leo Lionni\u2019s 1976 book Parallel Botany, of imagined organic shapes, inspired accessories that evoked a spiral, or a shell, or a constellation. To the fashion sisters Fanning, it\u2019s all connected under the aegis of divinity and perfection. If this all seems a little woo-woo and impractical, it\u2019s a testament to their ingenuity as designers that they can build abstract references into useful and compelling clothes. The sisters generate every garment from scratch, so that what might seem like a simple black tracksuit is actually an intarsia of circular satin shapes winding and pulsing around the body. Their knitwear comes with tiny juts and curves and their dresses, well, those are draped like classical garb with the carefree vibes of a modern woman. Modernity and ease are, in fact, chief on the designers\u2019 minds. They spoke backstage about wanting to make clothing that felt in and of their era.

His revival of a 1950s-through-to-1990s Belstaff produced a fishing vest\u2014chest-thumpingly named the Castmaster, in sidewalk-appropriate orange and riverbank-appropriate khaki\u2014that had this punter hooked (I\u2019ve since snagged a vintage example on eBay). It also included arms to make a very fine jacket. A corduroy collared Trialmaster in weathered patches of variously shaded khaki and olive cotton looked manly on its mannequin. A jacket with roughened metal fastenings in a nylon British Army woodland camo looked very fine as well, as did the beautifully treated green T-shirt worn layered under a shirt. Another four-pocket coat came in a thick olive canvas duck-piped in washed bridle leather. Freshly cooked and served on that mannequin, it looked like it has already enjoyed several eventful tours of duty\u2014an impression also given by Lehnhardt-Moore\u2019s super-attractive leather and waxed-cotton courier and overnight bags, respectively. Yet another revived jacket, named the XL 500, originally built for Belstaff\u2019s motorsport of trial racing, was the inspiration for some pieces, which were delivered in waxed nylon. This offered the lightness and versatility of the synthetic fabric with the potential to, in time, acquire a pleasing patina offered by the waxing process. There was womenswear, too. This included a sort of garagiste jumpsuit, skirts, and shirts with hand-drawn doodles illustrating the ephemera seen and acquired on the customer\u2019s idealized journey, and lots of versions of the men\u2019s jackets. By this point, however, I was basically just fantasy personal shopping\u2014and not for womenswear. The presentation format of items on mannequins, plus the lack of much of a thesis beyond very finely observed heritage-led product for a broad demographic, meant this felt more like a super-privileged browse in which the logic behind a new logo and T-shirt graphic was laid out by the brain behind it rather than a sales assistant.

The designer talked about how it helped her slow down and, quite literally, stop and smell the roses. Mote seemed more relaxed than previously, and her new designs reflected this ease. That isn\u2019t to say that she hasn\u2019t been busy. Earlier this year, Mote opened her first brick-and-mortar store in L.A. Mote\u2019s Spring collection was born out of a desire for something softer, lighter, easier\u2014a feeling some of us New Yorkers can relate to, especially after eight days of fashion shows and appointments. The ease paid off. Mote\u2019s newest designs are some of her most impressive and thoughtful yet. She added ruffle and ruche detailing to her typically strong, architectural silhouettes, and utilized balloon sleeves and petal-like paneling on slips. The collection touched on popular trends like prairie dresses, but they felt distinctly like her more familiar work, with sculptural twists like a mismatched, off-the-shoulder sleeve or an asymmetrical drawstring detailing the torso. There was more color in Mote\u2019s palette than usual, including a pop of red that was really a departure for her.

Their story (which is covered in great detail in a recent oral history) began around 1999. (Back then Kai K\u00fchne was with them, and they were called As Four; the Three was added in 2006.) The group has always been interested in organic forms and is known for its use of curvilinear shapes. Over time they further explored technology and have become increasingly vocal about promoting peace and other issues they care about. All of these elements were at play this season. For Spring, the three designers turned their attention to the environmental crisis. \u201cPeople are more conscious of plants; they understand now that plants have feelings,\u201d said Asfour. \u201cWe wanted to celebrate plants,\u201d chimed in Donhauser, \u201cbecause,\u201d Asfour continued, \u201cwe are all part of one planet. We can\u2019t be separated from the plants.\u201d Threeasfour\u2019s Fall show was a redo (with updates) of its very first collection for As Four (you can see it here). This season they borrowed the title, \u201cHuman Plant,\u201d and reconsidered the concept of that 1999 lineup but took it \u201csomewhere completely new,\u201d said Asfour. Essentially they (re)turned to nature. The pieces, in the main, were inspired by leaves, though there was a beautiful pair of dresses that shared the stained-glass effect of butterfly wings, and patchworked bodysuits in neutral tones somewhat resembled mottled bark. There was no mistaking the third exit for anything other than a padded leaf that embraced the wearer. Still, this was more effective, and somehow seemed less literal, than the printed looks (the pattern was based on an algorithm of leaf veins), which were the least convincing overall. It\u2019s not easy keeping any brand going for two decades, let alone an avant-garde one like Threeasfour. Some of the sheer looks with curving seams exposed in an almost skeletal matter\u2014backstage, Gil spoke of the team\u2019s juxtaposition of anatomy and botany\u2014seemed like a candid statement of vulnerability. It wasn\u2019t a stretch to imagine seeing a sort of winged windbreaker on the street. The hero pieces (looks 22 and 26), however, were out of this world in that special Threeasfour way.

Rather than harden his grip on trendiness for Spring 2020, Adams Dolan loosened up, cutting a freer, more uninhibited look. He did it with the use of linen for lightness and lots of tiny pintucks that nipped shorts up to the hip or turned the sleeves of poet dresses into ballooning shapes. Some models, with their platform Teva sandals and hair wrapped in string, seemed almost like prepster mermaids dredged up from the shores of Martha\u2019s Vineyard.

He called this collection a \u201cnew American folktale\u201d after the show, explaining that the striped blazers that imply drug rugs are actually a reference to rowing attire, now cut to be a bit threadbare around the edges. Denim, the heart of his brand, was imagined as a pleated front dress or continued in languid, long suiting. For those who have followed the young talent since his graduation from Parsons, those sloped blazers and pooling trousers will recall his earliest work\u2014you know, the stuff that put him on Rihanna\u2019s radar? Of course, Rihanna has her own collection now, which is also, curiously, about denim blazers and catty skirts.

The brand built in the image of its founder, Batsheva Hay, has confounded the fashion and pop culture worlds since arriving on the scene in 2015. Is it modest? It is sexual? It is a fetish or a uniform or a performative expression of self? It is even fashion at all? Before her show at the New York Law School today, Hay explained that she was tired of answering everyone\u2019s questions\u2014read a little deeper and you get the sense that maybe she is peeved at having to find solutions to other people\u2019s problems or fascinations with her\u2014so she got someone else to do it. Actually it was a group: Jamieson Webster (a psychoanalyst), Chiara Bottici (a philosopher), and Melissa Ragona (an art historian and theorist), three academics in three diverse fields who would, a press release promised, \u201cengage critically with Batsheva\u2019s newest collection\u201d while models walked through a lecture hall in the law school. Writer and podcaster Aminatou Sow introduced and moderated the panel. \u201cThey make me feel like a pioneer woman who can\u2019t be fucked with,\u201d Sow said of Batsheva\u2019s garments. The lecture was called \u201cNeck, Wrist, and Ankle: Recurrence in Batsheva\u2019s Clothing.\u201d Each speaker presented her essay accompanied by a PowerPoint presentation of pertinent details and helpful quotes. It was the sort of high-level brainwork that liberal arts graduates turned women in the arts would relate to; the sort of high-level brainwork that pseudo-intellectuals would love to pretend to understand; and the sort of high-level brainwork that Insta-girls will screen-shot and quote on social media. So in many ways it was the sort of cerebral performance that has mass appeal. Hay\u2019s panel of critics laid out lots of excellent points too, including a description of her clothing as \u201cdefense of the tender areas of the body,\u201d a bit of praise for her garments for doing justice to \u201cunrecognized feminine labor,\u201d and a wise linguistic deconstruction of the words text and textile. So lots of rich, heady stuff here. Which was fantastic to watch unfold with a cast of celebrity friends like Melissa Gilbert, Kaitlyn Dever, Dianna Agron, Veronica Webb, and Gretchen Mol. But it was also a bit of a bummer because the perfectly tuned, incredibly self-aware performance distracted the audience from the clothes. Hay will readily admit she is not a trained designer, but her Spring collection advanced in leaps and bounds. She introduced new materials, like a slinky, semisheer chiffon and a black oil-slick rubberized nylon. Her silhouettes were more waisted than ever, tied and cinched with a wide belt. Separates abounded, such as kerchief-hem aprons and a tunic worn by Rory Culkin. One of the best pieces was a nightie style with an embroidered note on the leg that summed up the fever and the fury of Batsheva perfectly: Victorian Secret. Backstage before the show, Hay spoke about her home life as a reference for this collection. She works from her apartment and describes her time inside her space as when she is able to imagine freely, to dress freely, to be who she really is. She dreams in her home\u2014and maybe does a little self-analysis too. Her clothes give that promise to the world: to dress like no one is watching. The problem is, of course, that people are always watching, but this show was a testament to not letting others get in your way."}, {"Designer": "Marc Jacobs", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The models in Marc Jacobs\u2019s show emerged en masse from the far side of the Park Avenue Armory tonight, spilling out of a small door and spreading to fill the cavernous space. A chorus line of brilliant color, sparkle, flower prints, and Stephen Jones chapeaux, they got closer and closer and eventually breezed right past the audience. For a brief moment some thought it was over before it began. Jacobs is just perverse enough to do it, but he had clearly taken too much pleasure in the making of this collection not to let it last. His show came near the end of a Fashion Week cut from seven days to five by the new CFDA chairman, Tom Ford. Renaissance is too strong a word for the goings-on here in New York, but the runways have felt revitalized\u2014by the experiential approach designers are taking to their staging and by engaging clothes. This Jacobs collection was the capstone to that. And fun, too! Jacobs has been a big proponent of fun lately. His Instagram feed is a lively mix of dog pics, throwbacks, selfies, and #OOTDs, each one more inspired and fabulous than the last. He was just named to Vanity Fair\u2019s 2019 Best-Dressed List, and no wonder. Few people take as much delight in dressing up as he does, and what a wardrobe: Demna Gvasalia\u2019s Balenciaga, Prada, Rick Owens, the Savile Row tailor Huntsman\u2014Jacobs gives props to them all and then some. His new collection was sort of like Instagram\u2019s #OOTD tag (275 million posts and counting) come to life. Jacobs has eclectic tastes, and he let them roam far and wide here. There were odes to Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld, and to Shelley Duvall, Anita Pallenberg, and Ann Reinking in All That Jazz. Some of the models slinked across the Armory like a Bob Fosse dancer (props to choreographer Stephen Galloway). That attitude and sense of individuality was central to the collection\u2019s magic. The last look, a long jersey dress with a lace back, was lifted from a famous Jeanloup Sieff photo of Marina Schiano, who died just this week. In his program notes, Jacobs railed against design by \u201ccomputer or the cloud or the transient archives of the internet.\u201d Time marches on and the digital revolution will get all of us in the end, but that doesn\u2019t mean we have to go down quietly.

They were likely even more skeptical when they heard he\u2019s only 21. But Cooper is happy operating outside the confines of our so-called open-minded industry. He was just 18 when he launched his debut collection (his mom is still handling the finances!), but even then, he seemed to understand precisely where streetwear was headed: to the uppermost stratum of high fashion. Cooper\u2019s twist is to give streetwear staples\u2014bomber jackets, T-shirts, hoodies\u2014a luxe yet vaguely collegiate twist, a clever reminder that he didn\u2019t go college himself. For Spring 2020, he dreamed up a fictional high school called \u201cWater\u2019s Edge,\u201d located in a small town surrounded by nature\u2014maybe somewhere in California or the Pacific Northwest. Varsity jackets and T-shirts emblazoned with the \u201cschool crest\u201d or printed with hand-drawn patches were mixed with more outdoorsy gear like field jackets, utility vests, and nylon parkas. The REI vibe has been trending for a few seasons now\u2014all Cooper was missing was a pair of Tevas\u2014but the drawstring prairie skirts lent a surprisingly feminine touch. (They were styled with sweatshirts, not camisoles, naturally.) Cooper is careful not to get carried away with \u201cconcept pieces,\u201d though; he believes a key differentiator of his brand is that \u201cthere isn\u2019t anything here I can\u2019t make a thousand of.\u201d He\u2019s in the business of making product inspired by real, often anonymous people; earlier this year, he said he\u2019s \u201cinspired by things like classic workwear and people who wear clothing for function in daily life, not necessarily for fashion in the way we commonly think of it.\u201d He staged his presentation in the corporate offices of Havas Agency, a branding and advertising company he\u2019s worked with before. Guests walked past conference rooms filled with deliberating employees before making it to Cooper\u2019s space, where he\u2019d set up patches of astroturf and picnic tables to stage an after-school hang. His other 20-something and teenage friends were milling around, and you couldn\u2019t help but read into the contrast of the slick, corporate setting and young, enthusiastic kids. It said a lot about Cooper\u2019s position in the industry: You get the feeling he\u2019s not dying to stage a mega-show on the Fashion Week calendar, nor is he particularly concerned about social media value (his Instagram is an endless scroll of product shots, with zero selfies or vacation snaps).

Retired to the Caribbean after a long and fruitful career onscreen, the Oscar winner didn\u2019t abandon the excitement of her former life; instead, Colbert took Hollywood with her, turning Bellerive into a must-visit destination for her high-powered friends. Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow honeymooned there, Princess Margaret popped in on occasion, and so did Babe Paley and Slim Keith. The mystique surrounding Colbert and her tropical getaway still resonates nearly six decades later, so when it came time to craft their Spring 2020 collection, Mark Badgley and James Mischka looked to the era and its ambiance. \u201cThe way they entertained at night and dressed by night was beautiful; we saw photos, and it was so inspirational,\u201d said Badgley post-show. \u201cIt brought an ease to the glamour that we wanted to capture in the clothes.\u201d Bright florals and juicy shades of tangerine and lilac added to the tropical feel. Though the fabrics were handmade in Italy, the palette was based entirely on Barbados. \u201cWe did a lot of the palm colors of the vegetation from the island, plus the aqua and lagoon shades,\u201d said Mischka. \u201cWe hope it feels like you\u2019re on a vacation when you\u2019re wearing these clothes.\u201d A power suit on model Maria Borges that served as the opening look brought sumptuous florals into a boardroom setting, while belted mixed-print dresses and a series of breezy eyelet-covered pieces offered getaway vibes. Even the swimwear, with its ruffled bikini tops and punchy prints, was shown beneath coordinating blazers or lightweight coverups to highlight the quick change before making a jump into the pool. Nighttime is where Badgley Mischka truly shines and as the pair delved into eveningwear, things got interesting. Though they stayed true to the summery theme, the embellishment level went way up. Colbert\u2019s heyday was in the \u201930s and \u201940s, and the collection honored that by updating several popular vintage silhouettes: tiered dresses with ruffles, big shoulders, and puffed sleeves all featured. Throwbacks are always welcome, but the most exciting elements were strictly modern. White gowns detailed with three-dimensional flowers and the final look, with its flash of sparkle peeking out beneath transparent stripes, both seemed ideal for modern movie stars."}, {"Designer": "Yeohlee", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "When I arrived at Yeohlee Teng\u2019s studios on West 29th Street today, she joked that she was the \u201cQueen of Scraps.\u201d It goes without saying that Teng creates her collections using zero waste. She\u2019s been doing this for years, long before sustainability became a buzzword in the conversation about how wasteful fashion can get. Teng is so skilled at using all fabrics that her work has been taught in courses at fashion schools and exhibited in museums. If you look at any Yeohlee collection, you\u2019re probably looking at materials the designer has used from her beginnings in the early \u201980s. That\u2019s older than most of these young downtown folks creating clothes now. That said, Teng really knows how to make the most out of what she has, and it should be both studied and appreciated. There are lots of hands-on elements in her work, and many of the looks can be adjusted and worn different ways. Sometimes, when designers create hands-on looks, it feels complicated, and I wonder if the wearer even understands how to alter the pieces themselves. Teng makes it easy. Among her signature boyish silhouettes\u2014loose striped pants and breathy tops in black and white\u2014a favorite here was a \u201cflip\u201d tank. It was made from slate blue linen with a marsupial pouch in waxy gray linen. The pouch flipped not only over the front of the body but also behind the body. Teng mentioned she was thinking about putting a zipper on it to make it like a fanny pack (or backpack!). It transformed the groovy-sounding idea of \u201cconceptual\u201d into something that was actually both wearable and useable. You could put your wallet and keys in there.

Perhaps it was premature to call Fall 2019 her \u201cbreakthrough,\u201d because the term would be better applied to today\u2019s Spring 2020 show. Staged at The Players Club, a historic social club for actors in Gramercy Park, this was neither an immersive, celeb-studded mega-experience nor a soulless, run-of-the-mill runway show, the two extremes we\u2019ve come across this week. Instead, it was something lovelier in between: a beautiful setting with beautiful clothes, at once intimate and impactful. It\u2019s tempting to label Moscone a minimalist. Some of her pieces look simple\u2014the bias-cut LBD (worn by 90\u2019s model Natane Boudreau); the sleek suits; the oversize striped shirts. Look closer, though, and that stripe wasn\u2019t a printed cotton, but a semi-shiny ribbon jacquard. The satin cummerbund around the waist of a blazer had actually been hand-draped into and affixed to the jacket, an evolution of the twisting and knotting by hand that we\u2019ve seen in Moscone\u2019s dresses. She added that 99 percent of her blazers are now hand-constructed inside, a fact that may not resonate with the average consumer, but changes everything about the fit. Tailoring is central to Moscone\u2019s business, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily the highlight here. As a woman designer, it\u2019s more interesting to see her experiment with femininity and propose new twists on familiar tropes, like evening gowns. The ivory and lilac slip dresses with extra-long threads swishing behind the models prompted a few questions (Will the threads get tangled? What happens if they\u2019re caught in a door?), but they nailed the elegant yet tactile balance Moscone strives for. Every single thread had been painstakingly hand-stitched onto the dress. Couture details like that aren\u2019t unusual for a black-tie dress, of course, but the results are typically a lot fussier than this (think sequins, hand-beading, ornate patterns). Elsewhere, smocked cotton tunics were hand-embroidered with bunches of flowers for a bit of sweetness, and a few dresses came in a marbled print Moscone made in her apartment. No, this isn\u2019t a minimalist label at all; in fact, Moscone calls her approach \u201cmeticulous,\u201d with an eye toward timelessness rather than simplicity. \u201cI want these to be clothes you can wear now and in 30 years, with a relationship between material and craft and artistry,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the definition of true luxury\u2014it\u2019s anti-throwaway, anti-gluttony, anti-consumerism.\u201d Timeless doesn\u2019t always mean simple. For Moscone, it equates to something so special you\u2019d treasure it forever\u2014and wouldn\u2019t even consider throwing it out."}, {"Designer": "Hiraeth", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "It\u2019s tempting to see Spring 2020 as a turning point in fashion\u2019s sustainability conversation, but that\u2019s the key word: conversation. Designers large and small are talking about their impact this season, and many have started to make positive changes in their materials and production methods. But it will take time for things to change in a fundamental way. We\u2019re optimistic, though, particularly in light of one obvious truth: that this is a movement led by women. Well, of course it is. Maybe it has to do with women\u2019s instincts for protection and our greater emotional sensitivity, but there\u2019s also a fierceness in how today\u2019s women are rising up to tackle the status quo. Hiraeth, a new vegan line out of Los Angeles, is helmed by a trio of them: the actress Rooney Mara, Sara Schloat, and Chrys Wong. It launched quietly in early 2018, with a quite simple origin story: Mara, a longtime vegan, couldn\u2019t find great, non-leather shoes to wear, so she decided to make her own. Hiraeth\u2019s leatherette combat boots and loafers ground its frothy, more romantic clothes, all of which are made without fur, wool, alpaca, silk, or any animal-based material. For a young brand, Hiraeth established its aesthetic rather quickly, perhaps because it\u2019s all designed in Mara\u2019s image. Her preferred aesthetic is femininity with a bite and it\u2019s epitomized by the label's signature look: a pretty dress, a removable harness or peplum at the waist, and combat boots. For Spring 2020, Mara and her team expanded on the harness idea with a pale pink braided version (it looked like silk, but was a luxe alternative). There were more of their puffed-sleeve dresses here, with new experiments in transparency (an ivory lace dress felt less prim with its wrap-effect bodice) and gentle smocking along necklines and cuffs. \u201cIn an attempt to reduce our carbon footprint through importing raw materials every season, we started looking for people who create textures on plain fabrics right here in L.A.,\u201d Mara explained. \u201cOur search led us to one of the few existing pleating and smocking facilities still left in town. Most of them shut down in the last two decades because of outsourcing to China.\u201d A few of the smocked pieces came in a bouncy, almost sporty technical fabric, a departure from the label\u2019s more antique-y textures. \u201cThe feeling is a lot lighter, which feels appropriate for Spring,\u201d Schloat added. Celebrities like Sadie Sink and Sarah Paulson (and Mara, of course) have worn Hiraeth\u2019s evening wear, but they'll be drawn to its more casual propositions, too. There was an oversized jacket in Hiraeth\u2019s signature jacquard, and the ultra-light leatherette pants were so soft, you\u2019d swear they were \u201creal.\u201d By next fall, there will likely be more non-leather options to choose from, especially in footwear\u2014but don\u2019t expect Hiraeth to join the fashion calendar anytime soon. \u201cWe are still figuring out who we are as a brand and what we can excel at, and we want to grow slowly, in a more thoughtful way,\u201d Mara says. \u201cWe definitely want to be able to offer more shoes and accessories in the future\u2014I do feel that is where the biggest need for animal-free products is.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Dion Lee", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "A Dion Lee show has the potential to be very serious. The designer has incredibly highbrow, minimalist-hewing taste and works in a state of constant paring back\u2014sleeker colors, more simplified lines, and more structural forms. So imagine how exciting it was when it was revealed that the pocket bustier that opened the show was actually two fully functional pockets, worn like two micro bags over a model\u2019s bust. It was a rare bit of humor in Lee\u2019s work, but it was reflective of a larger loosening up the designer has experienced since moving to New York last year. Sensuality is starting to displace structure in his collections, and for Spring 2020, he made strides toward an easier, more fluid version of Dion Lee. His starting point this season was lingerie and the way it highlights and reveals parts of the body. A shoulder harness\u2014very reminiscent of a Helmut Lang version from the aughts\u2014defined the erogenous zone of the collection, worn by male and female models. (Spring also served to welcome Lee\u2019s menswear back to the catwalk.) His tight tanks have an instant appeal, as do his second-skin knits, the best of which was an olive green maxi dress with braiding around the waist and cuffs. For a rare experiment with color, print, and lightness, Lee channeled bandanas into halter tops and dresses in cherry red that, if the audience\u2019s reactions were any indication, have plenty of real-world potential. But it would be a shame for fans to hone in only on his dresses. Perhaps it was the reintroduction of men\u2019s, or maybe it was just a testament to our time, but Lee\u2019s pants, shorts, and suiting have never looked better. Loose, slouchy, but still crisp, his white board-shorts suit and low-slung pants felt genderless, well cut, and very of-the-moment. So of-the-moment, in fact, that at least a dozen guests showed up to Lee\u2019s rooftop show in this very uniform: white tank, black pants, sandals. Some were women, some were men, at least one was visibly pregnant. A tank-and-pants combo doesn\u2019t seem like the most revelatory fashion proposition, but in the hands of a tailor as deft as Lee, it can be just the thing to amplify one\u2019s daily wardrobe.

Joined by musicians Celia Babini and Storey Littleton, the trio gave the audience at Spring Studios a dream pop serenade with a tune written by Emily King especially for the event. The song helped to set the mood for a collection that skewed ethereal. Roche is a minimalist, but advocating for less doesn\u2019t mean eschewing fantasy. Inspired by the beauty of a pearl necklace spotted on a woman during a dinner party, and an equally alluring button glimpsed during a recent trip to Italy, the Roches played with reflective textures and delicate finery. \u201cI never knew that I loved pearls until that moment,\u201d Ryan shared backstage. \u201cIt started this whole vision about reflection.\u201d Garrett responded to the theme with equal enthusiasm. \u201cNow our whole house is filled with pearls,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an element that spoke to us both really strongly.\u201d A David Byrne-worthy wide shouldered trench on the model Marique Schimmel began a series of monochromatic looks that were defined by the subtlety of their details. Anyone can do a blazer or a slip dress, but Roche\u2019s materials and the attention paid to tailoring elevate the essentials. Standouts were plentiful. A pale blue gown with spaghetti straps and a touch of lace at the hemline was appealing, as were loose pants worn low on the hips. Bermuda shorts proved surprisingly versatile when paired with silk button-downs or cashmere sweaters. Blue jeans done in collaboration with SLVRLAKE Denim were a new addition, but Roche skipped the jackets in favor of a periwinkle trench worn with a matching crop top. Naturally, pearls were a focal point, appearing on buttons or as lengthy crossbody strands, but they made the biggest splash on the menswear looks.

Actor Rosario Dawson and fashion executive/Bottega Veneta alum Abrima Erwiah have been engaged with enacting change using fashion as their vehicle since founding Studio 189 in 2013. Their aim is to make great clothes and at the same time support women\u2019s empowerment, preserve traditional crafts, and champion sustainability. The two are recent recipients of the CFDA Lexus Award for their work in that area. Circularity is important to Studio 189\u2019s day-to-day operations; this season it was built into their show concept as well, which was Heritage. \u201cWe really wanted to go back and see where we all come from and highlight that we all have a shared history,\u201d said Erwiah. \u201cAnd then figure out how we can work together to think about the future.\u201d The live musical performances and dance sequences were about looking back to move forward. The opening, said Erwiah, \u201cwas kind of like calling on our ancestors and giving thank you.\u201d Many of the looks that followed were shown on pairs of models, which was another way to highlight the importance of connectedness. Dawson was feeling it; at one point she was standing in the aisle dancing and singing along. When was the last time you saw a designer do something like that at their own show? It was a joy to see. The clothes were similarly upbeat. There were many mixed prints, an explosion of glorious color, indigo dyes, embroideries, and patchwork. Ease is a keyword of Spring 2020, and Studio 189 achieved it in the liquid flow of wide-legged and high-waisted pants for men and women. It was also built into romantic ruffled dresses that were a welcome evolution from that Holly Hobbie look. These were maxi-length, with lovely sleeve details and full skirts that moved beautifully. It was easy to imagine how soft they would feel moving against one\u2019s skin, whatever color that might be. Studio 189\u2019s work is informed by African and African-American experiences, but Dawson and Erwiah\u2019s inclusiveness was shown by their diverse casting and their thinking. \u201cAs much as it might seem new to some people, I think what\u2019s so important, and why we wanted to call this show Heritage, is that it\u2019s a reflection and a recognition that so many things\u2014from style influence to actual raw materials\u2014have come from Africa,\u201d said Dawson. \u201cThis was a celebration, a recognition of how interconnected we\u2019ve always been. And it\u2019s about time that we recognize that, so it doesn\u2019t seem profound, and it doesn\u2019t seem out of the ordinary, to see all of these different people coming together in celebration of our shared heritage. It is very normal.\u201d Like other designers this season, Dawson and Erwiah were also thinking about identity. A woven fabric in red, white, and blue stripes, said the latter, was a way to ponder the question, \u201cWhat is American?\u201d A triangular batik print referenced a motif associated with freedom quilts. At the same time that they wanted to bring symbolism to life, said Erwiah, she and Dawson also \u201cjust wanted to have a beautiful fashion show.\u201d Studio 189 achieved both goals with clothes that please the eye and have, if you care to find it, a message of unity."}, {"Designer": "Apiece Apart", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "\u201cModern earthy\u201d is how Starr Hout and Laura Cramer like to describe the vibe at Apiece Apart. Fans of their canvas trousers, flowery maxidresses, and best-selling jumpsuits would likely agree with that sentiment. Think of them as clothes for the city dweller with an inner flower child. Spring 2020 found the duo thinking about the early days of their label, when the Japanese concept of wabi-sabi was their guiding influence. More than a decade later, they\u2019re combining it with prints and textures inspired by Bali; they jokingly called it a \u201cwabi-Bali\u201d feeling. It was most obvious in the floor-length cotton shirtdress printed all over with mauve-y ikat, as well as in the barefoot styling; they photographed the collection on a quiet beach in Long Island. The more abstracted prints in new, washed-out colors\u2014orange and teal, black and aqua\u2014felt Bali-esque, but this wasn\u2019t a particularly literal collection. In fact, much of it seemed to indulge the designers\u2019 tendencies for a cleaner, more pared-back minimalism. Rolled-up shorts and blouses came in their signature \u201ctypewriter fabric,\u201d a thin, crisp cotton. The palette was almost entirely cream and beige, with a hit of soft aqua in the form of their favorite sweatsuit, a puffed-sleeve pullover with matching joggers. Bold color has been the story at Apiece Apart over the past few seasons\u2014Fall\u2019s petunia corduroys and vibrant damask prints are arriving in stores now\u2014so Spring felt surprisingly restrained. It might not grab the attention of brand-new customers, but for diehard fans this collection will feel like a timely palette cleanser\u2014and, in a way, it\u2019s getting back to that \u201cmodern earthy\u201d thing with simple but not stark basics."}, {"Designer": "Lauren Manoogian", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "A few months ago, Lauren Manoogian took her Spring 2020 collection to Philip Johnson\u2019s Glass House in New Canaan, Connecticut.

It has a glass ceiling made of linear, sloped panels, inlaid brick floors, and an art collection that includes pieces by Robert Morris and Frank Stella. Manoogian\u2019s clothes fit in well in the minimalist space. This season, her collection was lighter, more attuned to movement, and softer both in terms of fit and texture. Tank and tunic dresses looked like fluid, fabric sculptures on the body, as did a lightweight jumpsuit with drawstrings at the neckline and ankles. Her accessories, too, were airier. She introduced a new two-strap, nearly naked sandal and a crossbody tote that almost molded to the torso. Worn head-to-toe, her garments are the sort of wardrobe pieces you might see on an effortlessly chic artist-mom living in Brooklyn\u2060\u2014someone who favors luxe comfort over anything else.

Since their 2014 launch, Laura Vassar and Kristopher Brock have evolved their vision, picked up a CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund prize, and scaled their distribution, trying lots of different ideas along the way. Meanwhile, they\u2019ve become one of New York Fashion Week\u2019s can\u2019t-miss shows, and this season they scored a new time slot on the coveted final day. Vassar explained that Spring was a study of the duo\u2019s strengths and signatures, which are happily vast: They make a great evening gown but also great jeans. It was nice to see denim back on the runway after so many seasons without it; here, straight-leg jeans were styled with intricately embroidered tops and voluminous silk jackets, a mix that captured the \u201craw and romantic, but not too precious\u201d balance the designers established years ago. That high-low, livable mix had been somewhat lost in recent seasons\u2014fall\u2019s tweed skirtsuits and pussy-bow dresses look prim in comparison\u2014and in general, this collection was a return to those roots. There were moments of major drama\u2014i.e., the billowing jacquard gown over rumpled trousers that opened the show\u2014interspersed with truly casual stuff, like the white poplin dress that followed. Not every woman needs an evening gown, after all, but most of us do need great jeans, unfussy day clothes, and maybe a tiered, floor-length shirtdress that works for any occasion. (On the setting in the Pierre Hotel ballroom, Vassar added that she was going for a bit of a Great Expectations vibe, marrying over-the-top grandeur with something less refined.) The most compelling developments were the subtle shifts in proportions. Brock and Vassar set the trend for the little puffed-sleeve corsets and bustier dresses that have trickled down to every layer of the market, but Spring\u2019s fuller, couture-ish shapes will be harder to copy. A strapless rose gown with a grosgrain ribbon cinched above the bust was essentially a sack dress, while a plum cocktail frock with pearl-encrusted straps came in a rounded, tulip-like shape. Both felt freeing in their less-restrictive, away-from-the-body contours. Other designers have been easing up their silhouettes this week, too, as if to give us just a little extra breathing room in the early days of an anxious new decade."}, {"Designer": "Whit", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Looking at Whit\u2019s clothes makes a person want to pick up their bags and leave New York. This is a good thing. The looks bring you back to yesteryear, a picturesque time when global warming wasn\u2019t in our vocabulary, everyone was always enjoying some sort of picnic, and there was no social media. Designer Whitney Pozgay is a bit of a model citizen, too. She always appears happy and positive, and, yes, cares about the environment. Pozgay uses mostly natural fibers, which are so soft they feel like a thousand cherubs kissing the skin, and tries to seek out mills that are eco-friendly. Her latest task was to find a mill that doesn\u2019t contribute to ink runoff, another problem that poses a challenge to sustainability. Pozgay decided to shoot the collection at the retro Silver Sands Motel in Greenport, New York, a marshy, vineyard-dotted area located on the North Fork of Long Island across the bay from the Hamptons. In this idyllic setting, her collection came to life. It is, after all, a sweet little motel that was built in the \u201950s and has a strong Americana vibe, just as Pozgay\u2019s clothes do. Sometimes, her pieces have a time-capsule effect and may appear unchanged from the inspiration of their vintage era, like a sweet floral print orange babydoll dress, but Pozgay usually adds modern touches to bring her clothes into 2019. Take what looked like a high-waisted skirt fit for Mad Men\u2019s Betty Draper, but was actually a pair of huge palazzo pants that would be at home in any cool Brooklyn woman\u2019s wardrobe. Another standout was the simplest of the bunch: A white dress with a paper bag waist and cut-outs at the hips. It was clean and pure. While Whit\u2019s pert ginghams, earth-loving materials, and groovy floral prints may not deserve a city\u2019s air pollution or frigid corporate life, they have a way of making the wearer feel alive and fresh, like they aren\u2019t caught up in the smog of 9-5 culture."}, {"Designer": "Naeem Khan", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "In 2016, the world lost one of its most visionary architects: Zaha Hadid. Known for her deconstructionist, space-age style, Hadid built the Guangzhou Opera House in China, the National Museum of 21st Century Art in Rome, and, in 2004, she became the first woman to receive the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. She was many things to many different people, but to designer Naeem Khan, she was a very dear friend. His spring 2020 show was dedicated to her and her legacy, which is why he decided to stage his runway inside the lobby of a residential building she once designed in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Khan was proud to point out that he lives just upstairs in one of the sleek, curvilinear apartments. \u201cI wanted to do something more personal, salon style,\u201d a relaxed, T-shirt-wearing Khan (he\u2019s usually in a sharp suit) said backstage. For him, this season was about nostalgia and remembrance: of Hadid, of his days designing along Halston, of the era in fashion during which show intimacy outweighed a large and glossy front row. But Khan referencing the past is nothing new. The majority of his designs\u2014the sparkly fringe minidresses, the slinky, sequin slips and gowns with hoods\u2014are still closely bound to the aesthetic he built during his Halston days. That\u2019s not to say they aren\u2019t relevant, because they certainly are. Someone like a Bella Hadid or an Emily Ratajkowski would look fantastic in his body-hugging black sequin gown with a deep V-neck and padded shoulders. The same can be said when you imagine 2020 women like them wearing Khan\u2019s liquid fuchsia silk dress. As per usual, Khan\u2019s handiwork with beading and embroidery was stunning. This collection was clearly a very touching and personal one for Khan, and even if it could have used a bit more evolution away from the past in terms of point-of-view, it felt unapologetically like him\u2014something that his fellow bold and fearless creative friend would have been very proud of."}, {"Designer": "Jahnkoy", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "If you\u2019ve never heard of Jahnkoy, Maria Kazakova's sui generis fashion line, I\u2019d highly recommend finding time in your Fashion Week schedule for a visit to FIT, which is currently hosting a retrospective of the young designer\u2019s work. The gallery charts Kazakova's evolution from Moscow-based fashion student to aspiring designer and artist picking up on the eclectic, international style of the London street scene, to recent Parsons grad and LVMH prize finalist refining an aesthetic that\u2019s as much mission as vision. Put simply, Kazakova wants to use fashion as a vehicle for solidarity. We\u2019ve been waiting for this. For ages now, the emphasis in the fashion world has been on an ideology of fashion as a form for self-expression\u2014an uplifting conceit, but one that, like any ideology, can become suffocating over time. How self-expressive is it, really, to purchase an identity off the rack, from a corporation that profits by selling you stuff their marketing campaigns proclaim will make you you? Kazakova isn\u2019t anti-corporate\u2014she collaborates with Puma\u2014but her athleisure gear, embellished with beading, weaving, and graphics inspired by traditional costume from her native Siberia, argues in favor of accepting, and then elaborating, a global uniform, because the fights ahead for the world\u2019s youth can\u2019t be waged by any singular individual; they require an us. Which all of this preamble is to say, Jahnkoy\u2014this debut RTW collection itself, and the unconventional way Kazakova chose to present it, with dancers freestyling in the clothes before joining together in a choreographed jam\u2014might tempt you to believe the woman behind it is cuckoo bananas. But there\u2019s a dead seriousness at work here. To wit, as Kazakova explained after her show, she created the vinyl press-on graphics all over the collection because she wanted there to be an element of each garment that was handmade in Crown Heights, where she now resides. The beading on the Puma sneakers and intricate weaving on the clothes were done elsewhere, and that\u2019s fine; as Kazakova sees it, such handwork is lingua franca, and her aim is to seek out artisans working in traditional ways throughout the world, and find ways to collaborate with them. Basically, she\u2019s using athleisure as a jet on which heritage trades can hitch a ride out of history and into the future. And in so doing, she\u2019s actually taking athleisure seriously as fashion. Rather than treating sporty looks as an accent, she has accepted them as a form durable, flexible and capacious enough to fold in other influences, e.g., traditional Siberian dress. The result, tonight, felt very new and very cool\u2014a scrambled language of familiar signs. Every so often, it decoded itself to read: I want that long quilted jacket, or, those long sweatskirts with Slavic designs all over them are pretty dope.

She\u2019s designing what she feels is authentic to who she is and mirrors what she wants out of fashion. The result for Spring was a collection that was heavily craft-oriented and fabulously technical. On first blush, Li\u2019s new lineup looked like something you might wear while gardening, or, better yet, drinking a mug of tea while looking out your window, imagining that if you had a little more time, you\u2019d probably have a garden. Spring\u2019s pieces took a second to grow on you, and they bloomed with meaning over the course of the show. One sumptuous cream sweater was activated by UV light, which soon revealed a print made from Li\u2019s name. A calf-length pleated skirt turned out to be made of the same windbreaker fabric as its companion jacket. Then there was the collection\u2019s tearjerker and highlight: a recurring photo print of Li\u2019s parents in their 20s. In it, her mother stands shoeless on a rock in a little batik dress as her dad grins beside her. Both the batik pattern and the photo were duplicated in several garments, paying homage to Li\u2019s past while leaning into the future. Li\u2019s labor is one of love and of patience.

Recently, he and McCollough have toggled between couture-ish experimentation and pared-way-down sportswear. This collection struck a satisfying medium, balancing structured tailoring with soft draping. Their dresses had a high wearability quotient, too. Not coincidentally, the designers said they took most of their inspiration from the women in their office, many of whom have started having children and, therefore, know a thing or two about balancing. \u201cThey\u2019re such badasses,\u201d Hernandez raved. He and McCollough also mentioned their own mothers, and said they conjured up youthful memories of how they used to dress for work, which explains the \u201980s-ish proportions of the jackets and pants with their strong shoulders and elevated waists.

Building a brand is an uphill struggle; having passed the 10-year mark with his fall 2019 collection, this designer seems to be enjoying the view. There was a new and refreshing airiness to his work for spring\u2014despite having one of the heaviest backstories. An optimist, Mohapatra had already set his palette of mango, blue, and pink shades when he discovered Nothing Personal, a book by Richard Avedon and James Baldwin that considered American identity in words and pictures. More than 50 years later, it\u2019s still a hot topic that\u2019s being examined in courtrooms and classrooms, and even on catwalks. This important 1960s work seemed to guide the Indian-born designer to focus on qualities like strength, originality, and diversity that he feels are most American. It was an examination that led to the collection being \u201cnothing but personal,\u201d as he put it. Mohapatra decided to demonstrate his \u201ccraft and what I really bring to the table. I decided,\u201d he said, \u201cnot to get bothered by what is expected of me so much.\u201d It felt like a window had been opened. This was one of Mohapatra\u2019s most confident and relaxed collections. Always partial to architectural shapes, in the past these have sometimes resulted in pieces that seem to house the body stiffly. Not this season. Pleated tulle let the light in, as did guipure lace and point d\u2019esprit. Rhinestones, some of which swung in pendant strands from cocktail sheaths, met their match in the diamond jewelry collection the designer introduced this season. Not low (as in high/low), but definitely not gala evening, were a Supima denim dress and luxe wide-legged jeans that could be dressed up or down. The use of cotton shirts to layer under a dress felt fresh here, and a shirtdress with a removable, glittering embroidered tulle top also gave the customer options for day and night. Many designers have been fixated on the 1980s of late; Mohapatra revisited the pouf silhouette of that era in a way that felt fresh, fun, and very him. There was honesty and transparency in this collection; the designer even revealed his alter ego via a custom pink and orange jacquard, which is better for show than the saleroom, that read \u201cB The One.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s my secret nom de plume on social media accounts where I can be political and sort of raise my voice,\u201d Mohapatra explained.

For Fall, they emphasized their tailoring; here, jackets played only a supporting role, topping a barely there wrapped chiffon minidress or a lace top and silk moir\u00e9 party shorts set. Last season\u2019s patchwork prints must have performed well, because Kim and Garcia revisited them in breezier shapes and lighter-weight materials. In general, the stronger the sense of hand and texture the better here. De la Renta would have recognized the very pretty embroidered linen dress and the woven raffia numbers.

The ride up was dark, grimy, and most of the exposed crevices probably hadn\u2019t been washed since the building was built. But the actual space where the show would be, a communal workshop, was quite refreshing. Most guests were dressed in fantastically bright and outrageous clothing.

They were illustrated with forget-me-not flowers and a longer flower, which my coworkers and I identified as heather, that appeared to be placed in a man\u2019s butt.

Solis wanted to take the clich\u00e9, meme\u2019d about phrase \u201cflorals for spring\u201d from the film The Devil Wears Prada and give it a darker varnish. He collaborated with London-based artist Bex Day to create the graphics. One dress had a swathe of fabric cutting across the image of a subject with flowers stuffed into her mouth, which felt sinister and fetish-minded. On a white silk dress, the graphic of a flower was blown up and blotted in verdant green and daffodil yellow, which looked quite elegant but was anchored with Solis\u2019s downtown mindset thanks to a cool leather fringe sash that cut across the body. The graphics were entertaining but not as strong as Solis\u2019s work with leather and denim, two things he wanted to focus on this season. (These will be the factors that will eventually separate him from the pack of ebbing downtown designers.) The coat in Look 2 had a deliciously creep-tastic feel. The leather plackets, separate from the rest of the coat, pointed upwards like devil\u2019s horns. The actual torso area of the coat had a sharply scooped-out bodice. The silhouette of many of the pants felt both nasty and cool. The bottom hems were elongated and sat in front of the foot; they dragged across the floor.

After the best-selling moto jackets, shearling coats, and puffers of seasons past, the cherry red leather trenchcoat that opened the show offered a cool new outerwear proposition and came in all manner of New Wave\u2013inflected bright colors. Vevers usually adds an artistic note to his clothes, and this season he partnered with the estate of Richard Bernstein, the artist behind Interview magazine\u2019s distinctive illustrated covers. A relatively new face of Coach, Michael B. Jordan was among the stars enjoying the action from the front row. The crew of high schoolers he brought as his guests today would have been hard-pressed to name the celebrities in Bernstein\u2019s portraits who appeared on tank tops and tees\u2014Michael J. Fox, Barbra Streisand, and Rob Lowe, all of whom Vevers idolized growing up. Having plucked one handbag style from the brand\u2019s 78-year history, Vevers took the opportunity to celebrate Coach\u2019s legacy, too. Denuded of charms, bells, and whistles, the classic lunch box\u2013size styles that were carried by models on the runway had an appealing simplicity. As the craze for teeny-tiny bags begins to tire, these could be the anti-It bags to relieve that fatigue."}, {"Designer": "Cynthia Rowley", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Today, a bird pooped on me during the Cynthia Rowley show. (At first I thought it was a stray droplet from an air conditioner, but no.) This felt like one of those ironic, existential moments. Fashion Week is the most well-heeled time of the year and I was sitting befouled (or befowled) on one of the most beautiful streets in New York, a section of Tribeca\u2019s Jay Street that has an old-timey overpass above it. (Rowley\u2019s team moved there a few months ago and call it one of the most Instagrammable spots in the city.) Birds aside, outdoor shows have a lot to be said for them: no tyrannical air conditioning, and it\u2019s fun to see the passersby curiously watching what is going on. In this case, there was so much commotion that onlookers were hanging off fire escapes to see what was happening street level. So what was going on? Rowley made the runway from a long carpet comprised of illustrations from Doctor Seuss\u2019s Oh, The Places You\u2019ll Go. (She had acquired the rights from the estate.) Down the carpet-runway floated a boho black peasant dress with groovy pastel florals. (Pretty!) A low-slung silk pant in a sweatpant silhouette that was swirled with chocolate brown, bronze, white, and pink added a needed masculine factor to the femme-forward collection. At times the florals felt too heavy-handed, as when printed all-over on an oversized boxy jacket, but the macram\u00e9 technique using trippy florals was, well, groovy. Rowley later noted that she\u2019ll be traveling to various international cities to show this collection, hence the Seuss reference. Fun fact: While trying to remove bird poop from myself, I asked my seatmate, a fellow journalist, for help. She mentioned that funnily enough, back in 2016, when Blake Lively attended the Cannes Film Festival wearing a pert leaf-print Cynthia Rowley dress, a bird pooped on her, too. What are the odds? Post-show, Rowley told me it means good luck. Coincidences aside, my seatmate also mentioned that Rowley has started making surfwear completely out of sustainable materials. \u201cThink about all of the microplastics in the ocean!\u201d she said. Rowley later confirmed this: she is substituting petrochemicals with limestone and recycled materials. The designer\u2019s choice is a necessary one given the crumbling state of the environment. Rowley makes a wickedly stellar wetsuit and half of her clients wear her colorful rash guards as actual shirts. One wetsuit on this runway was sliced in half down the middle; one side a robin\u2019s-egg blue and the other a light mocha. It had an effortlessly cool retro feel, and was enough to make even a non-surfer want to grab a surfboard and hit the waves."}, {"Designer": "Pamella Roland", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The cast of The Real Housewives of New York City had very much arrived at the Pamella Roland show today at Pier 59. There were four of them: Ramona Singer, Dorinda Medley, Luann de Lesseps, and Sonja Morgan, who invited me to a fashion show of her own this coming Friday. The women are really a sight to see, especially if you\u2019ve never watched an episode of their show, like this writer. The pack of reality stars with perfect blowouts took up a whole lotta space with their video crew trailing behind. When I went backstage to interview Roland, she suggested we move to another room to speak. \u201cThe Housewives are here,\u201d she said. Perched front row, they embodied the megawatt clothes on the runway. It goes without saying that Roland\u2019s garments are for customers who don\u2019t shy away from the spotlight but in fact worship it. Women who wear Roland\u2019s dresses, which are often bedazzled and glitzy, want those sparkling embroideries to catch the light of a camera flash. Per that message, there were those signature no-fail dresses, like a grass green gown fully embroidered with crystals, appearing as if it were painted onto the model. The majority of these weren\u2019t groundbreaking, but they served the customer. What was new from Roland were her zebra-print pieces. They broke up the monotony of all the jewels and florals. (She mentioned that animal prints were a best-seller from last season.) Look 18 was a standout: A short dress with spangled zebra print, sliced with cutouts, and a skirt that bloomed with ostrich feathers that were dyed black and white. It was definitely fierce enough for a Housewife."}, {"Designer": "Josie Natori", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Spain was on Josie Natori\u2019s mind when she began to consider her Spring 2020 collection. The nation\u2019s traditional dress has long been a reference point for designers, but Natori put her own spin on it. The designer is originally from Manila, and she viewed the Spanish traditions through the lens of their connection to the Philippines. What followed was a meditation on mantillas, caftans, and summertime escapes. Since launching her secondary line last year, Natori has sought to increase the luxury factor within her primary collection. Pieces detailed with floral embroidery and delicate beading or crafted with gossamer-light silks added to the sumptuous feel, but the season\u2019s standout element was embroidery. Swirls and blooms meant to evoke the lacy beauty of mantilla veils were worked onto cocktail dresses and jackets, giving them a luscious beauty. \u201cI wanted something that could be carried from day to night,\u201d said Natori of the detailing, \u201cto keep everything elegant yet easy.\u201d That concept served as the collection\u2019s overarching goal. Fashion Month has no shortage of pretty clothes, but few are as effortless as Natori\u2019s coral suits with cigarette pants or the white linen dresses that required nothing but a pair of sandals and the right attitude. Even showier pieces like the asymmetrical tops with sweeping trains and elaborate embellishment managed to feel carefree."}, {"Designer": "Herv\u00e9 L\u00e9ger", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Why aren\u2019t Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid wearing Herv\u00e9 L\u00e9ger? The figure-skimming clothes are practically built for them, just as they were built for their \u201990s supermodel predecessors (and for women who want to feel hot and love the idea of bodycon.) Lest you forget, Herv\u00e9 L\u00e9ger hit the bandage look out of the park back in the early \u201990s, when there were huge runways, huge budgets, and huge supermodels. Google \u201cHerv\u00e9 L\u00e9ger \u201990s\u201d and gawk at the Amazonian likes of Cindy Crawford and Elle Macpherson: They were cinched so tightly into those viscose dresses that you\u2019d think their ribs would bend and their organs would shift. And yes, they really did look fantastic. Creative director Christian Juul Nielsen has done a great job at taking the building blocks of early Herv\u00e9 L\u00e9ger\u2014simple bandage dressing, and the lesser-known but still important technique of draping\u2014and bringing the label into 2019. But he also understands that customers love classics. \u201cThere is no point trying to change the brand,\u201d he told me at the presentation today at the Nomad hotel. As an example, a moss green, Lurex-speckled column dress felt plucked from the Herv\u00e9 archive. It had that stellar head-to-toe, suck-you-in silhouette that longtime diehards would love. When Nielsen did insert his own voice into the pieces, the result was great. In some cases, his hand felt really modern, like a pale pink silk turtleneck melded with a bandage dress. (Other additions, like the knit ruffles on a dress, hung oddly off the body.) One yellow dress with a mock neck had bandaging and included a triangular pleat made of tiny bandages to give the silhouette a jutting kick. The timeless number would be complete paparazzi bait if Hadid or a Jenner wore it, and it should make any women who wear it at least feel like paparazzi bait."}, {"Designer": "Eckhaus Latta", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "This afternoon\u2019s Eckhaus Latta show opened with a wave of double takes: Was that a ruffled minidress on the runway, or were the audience\u2019s eyes deceived? Lest anyone was truly in doubt that Zoe Latta and Mike Eckhaus had indeed produced such a frothy confection, the designers followed up that first look with series of similar ones\u2014a frilly blouse; a short, A-line frock patchworked with lace; and, for good measure, a boxy men\u2019s button-down that gave the graphic, tape-like trim on the foregoing garments headline billing. Speaking after the show, Eckhaus and Latta said that this season they set out to work with fashion elements that generally made them uncomfortable, and, in particular, take on their historic allergy to cuteness and frill. \u201cWe wanted to see what those sorts of elements looked like done in our hand,\u201d Eckhaus explained. Glitter and sparkle was another un\u2013Eckhaus Latta element that the duo stared down and made its own; a series of all-over sequined dresses in blue and orange came off as coolly minimal, despite the Bob Mackie\u2013level of embellishment. And this was an overall theme of the show: Again and again, Eckhaus and Latta found ways to make familiar kinds of fashion frippery look new and crisp. The designers\u2019 willingness to take on ideas that cut against their natural instincts was an expression of confidence\u2014and, too, their preference this time out for showing full looks rather than collaging items into magpie ensembles. Thus you caught the full force of Latta\u2019s knits, whether hallucinogenic intarsias or 21st-century updates on Missoni\u2019s iconic weaves; some of the strongest statements here were the knit tank and flare ensembles, the pants bottoming out in unapologetic pleated bells. The tailoring was just as forceful, whether voluminous pinstriped suits for the guys or, for the ladies, ultra-high-waist wide-leg pants with a satiny finish, paired with a matching blazer with doubled pockets. Shapes traded between slouchy and blouson and utterly sleek, with one of the collection\u2019s standout garments, pairs of sheer-ish nylon cargo pants, finding a middle ground between the two. Those cargos will sell like hotcakes, and indeed, much of this collection seemed destined to do well on the racks. The clothes were, in relative terms, very slick\u2014another element, perhaps, that Eckhaus and Latta decided they were ready to take on and make their own."}, {"Designer": "Christian Cowan", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Christian Cowan knows his client: She likes a heel, she loves color, and she\u2019s not afraid to shine. His muses sat all a-sparkle in his front row this week\u2014Erika Jayne to Karrueche Tran. A shout-out must go to the woman who wore a black feather tutu so wide it took up an entire bench. It\u2019s this kind of look-at-me energy Cowan delivers on the runway, with his stretch crystal dresses, generous use of sequins, and love of a big-time plumage moment. But for Spring 2020, the designer sought to move past all the glitz and deliver a narrative. He drew inspiration from his mother\u2019s family in Spain, using their seaside town of Moa\u00f1a as a starting point. The sequined bathrobe worn by Karolina Kurkova to open the show was a reference to toweling off after a dip, and the tie-dyed patterns were meant to evoke the colors of a summer holiday. Cowan couldn\u2019t hold on to this theme for long, though. A harlequin pattern inspired by a perfume collaboration came out, followed by plenty of party frocks for his New York City girls. The diversity in his offering was honorable, but should Cowan want to make a bigger splash, he needs to hone in on the specifics. He\u2019s done well for himself at a young age, but his work is too special to become a something-for-everyone proposition."}, {"Designer": "Cushnie", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Early last week, a group of working mothers in New York gathered for a photo shoot on the first day of school. They traded stories and gave advice to new mom Carly Cushnie, whose five-month-old was on set. This marked the first time in two main seasons of helming her own brand that Cushnie has not shown her collection on a runway, and the timing couldn\u2019t be more perfect\u2014for her personally and for the industry as a whole. The experiential shows this week have indeed been the most exciting and well-received, but more to the point, the ones that really knocked it out of the park were those that had a deeper meaning and an important message attached. Pyer Moss designer Kerby Jean-Raymond\u2019s choir performance show at Kings Theatre was a spectacular, emotional celebration of black culture. At Collina Strada, designer Hillary Taymour set up a farmers market stand alongside her outdoor runway and, in a powerful, timely plea, asked attendees to help her save a dying planet. Cushnie wanted to celebrate womanhood. The designer called on her mother to model (the stunning woman featured in look seven), along with friends like actress La La Anthony, jewelry designer Jennifer Fisher, activist and lawyer Meena Harris, and stylist Kate Young. Supermodel Veronica Webb also posed, as did fashion and beauty journalist Supermodel Veronica Webb, business executive Bozoma Saint John, and model Sharina Gutierrez. They all wore Cushnie\u2019s fluid, pastel-infused ready-to-wear, which was partly inspired by the 1984 movie Splash, starring Daryl Hannah, and incorporated metallics and pearlescent shades that recalled the scales of a mermaid\u2019s tail. Cushnie and her baby modeled too. Cushnie is proud of these women, these images, these designs, and of the video component to this project: She partnered with an action campaign called Phenomenal Woman, which has recently kick-started an offshoot effort called Phenomenal Mother that works to benefit Families Belong Together, a grassroots organization fighting against the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy. Cushnie hopes that through the images and videos, she can shine a light on these amazing groups and call others to do what they can to keep mothers and children together. Her designs were covetable, but even more powerful was her motivation to celebrate the proud, powerful women who will wear her clothes out in the world."}, {"Designer": "See by Chlo\u00e9", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The glossy white walls of the Chlo\u00e9 showroom were so bright you could have sworn a fresh coat of paint was still drying. In contrast, the muted palette and beachy prints of See by Chlo\u00e9\u2019s Spring collection exuded a warm, earthy serenity, loosely inspired by Capri, Italy. The seaside theme fit the brand\u2019s signature wanderlust, this time with utilitarian details. The long khaki jacket with marigold lining is also water-repellant, a new must for the stylish jet-setter. Another take-anywhere topper came in ivory denim with a postcard-inspired logo on the back. Both grounded the typically floaty, multi-printed dresses women associate with the house, the best of which came in a patchwork motif of various florals and stripes. See by\u2019s accessories have begun to mirror Natacha Ramsay-Levi\u2019s best sellers on the Chlo\u00e9 runway, like the Hana bag, a crossbody adorned with a giant gold ring. New this season was the Treccia, a resin-handled macram\u00e9 bag with shoelace fringe, as well as a jeweled sneaker-sandal hybrid, a cute day-to-night shoe for the adventurous See by Chlo\u00e9 girl."}, {"Designer": "Vince", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Vince is a brand rooted in timeless wardrobe staples, so the big story each season tends to be about color and texture. Spring 2020\u2019s palette of beige, chocolate, mint, orchid, and cerulean was lifted from Javier Senosiain\u2019s Casa Org\u00e1nica in Mexico City, which also became the setting of the lookbook. Creative director Caroline Belhumeur noted there isn\u2019t a single straight line in the house: The walls, windows, and even floors are curved, with similarly amorphous furniture and fixtures inside. After discovering it on a trip to Mexico earlier this year, Belhumeur was instantly taken with the strange, earthy interiors and the way the sunlight filtered through the rounded windows; at certain times of day, it cast a pale yellow light, while the hue intensified as the afternoon dragged on. Spring was a bit like distilling those memories into visual, wearable statements. The Vince customer may not know anything about Senosiain or his house\u2014the challenge for Vince going forward will be to figure out how to tell these stories to more customers\u2014but she\u2019ll be drawn to the unusual colors. A silky mint blouse and lime pants made a bold statement despite essentially being pajamas, while other looks combined brights with neutrals: lemon and camel, lilac and taupe. In terms of texture, you expect to find the loftiest cashmere, the crispest cotton, and the supplest leather, but spring introduced another material: crochet. A narrow crochet tank dress brought in the natural, uneven textures of Mexico City architecture, though Belhumeur was careful to keep it from veering \u201ctoo crafty.\u201d It helped that Heather Kemesky was modeling the clothes\u2014though you may not have recognized her at first. She recently lightened her hair and let it grow into a shag, but her attitude hasn\u2019t changed a bit. She looked most like herself in the black belted leather jacket, which was at once luxe, tough, and a bit androgynous."}, {"Designer": "Vera Wang", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Vera Wang was back on the runway today for the first time in two years. It\u2019s the 30th anniversary of her business, a remarkable achievement. Wang, of course, began as a maker of modern wedding gowns, but her brand isn\u2019t just brides: Over the years she\u2019s dressed a who\u2019s who of Oscar winners and first ladies. \u201cDesigning for the red carpet, you\u2019re more of an Edith Head [the famous mid-century costume designer],\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not necessarily about your own personal philosophy.\u201d Wang\u2019s design philosophy is certainly idiosyncratic. In her collections, she favors attenuated silhouettes\u2014wispy layers accented by structured tailoring perched on extraordinarily high heels for an ambiance of romantic fragility. For spring, she made a study of lingerie elements used as accessories. \u201cI was searching for a new formula for evening that I thought was more modern,\u201d she said. Her explorations included hip-grazing chainmail slips featuring garter belts, sheer bra tops worn loose and unfastened over structured pieces, ruffled bustles, short shorts, and pelmet minis. It was deshabille in extremis. In the middle of the show, you saw the silhouettes that made Wang\u2019s career: long, vaguely Edwardian shapes that were indeed very romantic, like layered bias-cut slip dresses scooped out at the back so they sort of floated. But the complications of her improbably willowy silhouette proved overwhelming elsewhere, and two models took spills from their sky-high platforms. Wang has decades of experience balancing women\u2019s real-life needs with the oftentimes frivolous details that glamour demands. Her runway should rise to the same standards."}, {"Designer": "Nomia", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Nomia\u2019s Yara Flinn started making faux-leather shoes a few years ago, before words like vegan and sustainable had become synonymous with forward-thinking luxury. She was ahead of the curve, and faux-leather shoes\u2014at least stylish faux-leather shoes\u2014are still difficult to find. It\u2019s shocking how infrequently leather is mentioned in the sustainability conversation, in fact; if you have been paying attention, you\u2019ve no doubt seen the statistic that livestock agriculture is one of the top contributors to climate change. That\u2019s meat, dairy, cheese, and\u2014duh!\u2014leather. Earlier this year, Stella McCartney said the fashion industry\u2019s biggest impact is its use of leather, and \u201cpeople really don\u2019t want to talk about [it].\u201d Especially the luxury brands that do most of their business in accessories. Anyway: Until the industry reconsiders its leather use, conscious shoppers can at least buy Nomia\u2019s excellent vegan shoes. They\u2019re mostly low, walkable heels and strappy sandals, often with a sculptural metal heel, and this season Flinn whipped them up in such bright pastels as mint green, canary yellow, and glittery turquoise. Spending so much time on the shoes\u2014both here and in Portugal, where they\u2019re made\u2014subconsciously influenced Flinn\u2019s clothing designs, too. The cheerful palette trickled up into sheer layering pieces, square-neck slip dresses, and sporty bikinis, which Flinn styled like \u201creal clothes\u201d under dresses and turtlenecks. She liked how all of the different colors looked on the rack, and found that the various pieces worked together. It helped that everything was quite simple and streamlined; in many ways, Flinn is getting back to her minimalist roots, this time with a freer, easier attitude."}, {"Designer": "Alejandra Alonso Rojas", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Alejandra Alonso Rojas is by no means an under-the-radar designer. Instagram reveals that there exists a close-knit circle of Rojas-ites, and her clever hand-knits have been knocked off by fast-fashion chains. Still, this can only be described as a blockbuster year for the designer. A brief chronology of how her stars aligned goes something like this: Beyonc\u00e9 called and wanted to buy a suit. Rojas gave birth to her first child, the adorable Alonso. She was named a CFDA/Vogue finalist. And Kim Kardashian West wore Rojas\u2019s pomegranate red silk gown in the May 2019 issue of Vogue. Wow. Rojas might now be described as a girl on fire, but the designer and her work have always had a relatable warmth. It\u2019s one that lends itself to intimate settings. For Spring, Rojas presented her collection amid the bohemian splendor of Aurora Lopez Mejia\u2019s studio. The designer\u2019s cloud white sweater with pearls woven into the twisted collar was quite at home among the artist/jeweler\u2019s treasures and baubles. Rojas evolves, rather than abandons, past designs; new for Spring were shawl and draped details on her favored suit and dress silhouettes. The palette was sun-bleached and beachy. The main wellspring of Rojas\u2019s inspiration is her own family; she cast her net a bit further this season, traveling through her native Spain to visit Salvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s house, following the trail of artist\u2019s muses, like Gala Dal\u00ed and Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, who made appearances on her inspiration board. Ultimately, this show didn\u2019t have or need a narrative. \u201cI\u2019m really just celebrating women, our beautiful bodies, minds and souls, and how strong we are,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cTurning into a mom really made me realize that.\u201d A hand-drawn print of abstracted female forms was the most direct communication of her theme, but it was also there in the subtle ombre of natural dyes, the whisper-softness of suede, the cozy warmth of a hand-knit, the peekaboo allure of a crochet dress, the crispness of a white cotton bell sleeve. All expressed the \u201ccasual luxury\u201d Rojas aims for. The looks were shown on mannequins arranged in lifelike poses: One lolled on a Rococo daybed; another had her arms thrown out with joy, a scarf dripping from her fingers. The designer herself wore a sleeveless, color-block suede dress from the new collection, which reinforced how personal Rojas\u2019s work is. It was also a reminder that only flesh-and-blood women\u2014like the ones the designer was inspired by\u2014can bring clothes to life."}, {"Designer": "Gabriela Hearst", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "When my seatmate at Gabriela Hearst\u2019s show today said \u201cAmerican Herm\u00e8s,\u201d I was reminded of a review I wrote about the designer three years ago in which I said pretty much the same thing. Who doesn\u2019t like being proven right? But this isn\u2019t gloating. It\u2019s only that the comparison feels even more relevant this season with Hearst\u2019s deep focus on craft. Hearst has always chosen the most elevated fabrics\u2014even her deadstock has come from Loro Piana in the past. Here, she merged those fine materials with incredible made-in-NYC handwork. The macram\u00e9 leather panels on the show-opening black cotton trench took weeks to complete. Another trench in ivory-colored wool silk was spliced with silk macram\u00e9 pleats. Even more extraordinary were a pair of halter dresses, the bibs of which boasted geodes encased in silk crochet. In an industry first, Hearst\u2019s show was carbon neutral. She asked Bureau Betak to cut down on the power usage and waste associated with production (the models\u2019 hair was done without electricity). Then she enlisted EcoAct, an advisory group that works with clients to meet the demands of climate change, to calculate the emissions and determine the necessary offset amounts. Why go to all this trouble? Hearst explained: \u201cSo that this will eventually become an industry standard. If we can do it, other people can do it.\u201d The handwork is a Hearst standard\u2014and much harder to replicate. \u201cI don\u2019t make things that people \u2018need,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cPeople buy because they desire.\u201d Here are two more pieces from the collection likely to inspire lust: the sunflower yellow silk cotton crepon dress cinched with a geode buckle belt (the color is gorgeous and the easy silhouette impossible to resist), and a smock dress in patchworked linen, which is better for the planet than cotton because it requires less water to grow. Handbags have been a distraction on other runways this week; we\u2019ve seen so many and too many look the same. Hearst\u2019s have personality.

Before the show even started, it was clear she was feeling orange: In lieu of a slick catwalk, she laid down a plush, extra-wide clementine carpet. It was so long, in fact, that it curved up the wall to form a backdrop. Unlike most runway photos that show the blurred-out profiles or feet of the people sitting in the front row, LaPointe\u2019s look almost trippy with their edge-to-edge backdrop. Backstage, LaPointe said she chose orange because it\u2019s traditionally associated with determination, success, and power. As an independent woman designer approaching her 10th year in business, she\u2019s familiar with those concepts. Her approach to design\u2014whether it\u2019s a cashmere turtleneck or a sequined cocktail dress\u2014always starts with how it will make a woman feel. Her strength is in making clothes that instill confidence but aren\u2019t so overtly \u201cfashion\u201d that they distract from the woman wearing them. The strong tailoring and elegant silk separates tend to hit the sweet spot; just look at Jennifer Lopez or Zendaya, who have both worn LaPointe\u2019s new fall collection. LaPointe\u2019s tailoring experiments for spring included belted ivory pantsuits with knit capes layered on top, a proposition that looked more fluid than it sounds. The cape was a recurring theme, both in literal ways\u2014the show closed with an emerald cashmere cape that could replace your winter coat\u2014and subtler ones, like asymmetrically draped blouses that simply nodded to the flowing silhouette. As usual, nearly every look was monochromatic, ranging from blush to neon tangerine; Meghan Trainor was in the front row wearing head-to-toe baby blue from resort. She was into the orange-on-orange and all-ivory looks in the show\u2014on Instagram, she wrote: \u201cthe monochromatic is EVERYTHING!\u201d\u2014but as a voice of body positivity, she\u2019d likely have been even happier to see some less-conventional models wearing them. LaPointe\u2019s clothes are inclusive in a certain way, mostly in terms of the louche and woman-friendly shapes, which get positive reactions from buyers and the women she meets at trunk shows. But of late, we expect to leave a fashion show with more to think about than beautiful, wearable clothes: There should be a message and a story, whether it\u2019s in the casting, the setting, the way the clothes are made, or how the collection might address what\u2019s happening around us. Going forward, LaPointe\u2019s challenge will be to evolve and communicate her brand\u2019s position\u2014and maybe rethink the way she shows her collections\u2014so it aligns more closely with that of the women who wear it."}, {"Designer": "Veronica Beard", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "\u201cBarbie gone bad\u201d would be a fitting name for Veronica Miele Beard and Veronica Swanson Beard\u2019s spring 2020 collection.

That\u2019s what the Beards are known for, of course: chic suiting for women who may not shop vintage, but likely have a desire to recreate their mothers\u2019 and grandmothers\u2019 best looks. The Veronica Beard woman might look at a photo of a family picnic in the \u201960s and decide she needs to emulate the seersucker dresses and darling petal pushers of yore. She might listen to a record by The Ronettes, or watch a movie like Valley of the Dolls, and feel suddenly drawn to big hair, plaid miniskirts, and buttoned-up moir\u00e9 blazers in bubblegum pink. It\u2019s not the most original backstory, and at times there were moments of pastiche. But the Beards understand their client on a spiritual level and have a firm grasp on how they want to feel: sexy, empowered, and, above all, feminine. They know the ever-so-slightly subversive power that comes with wearing a sequined strapless dress, and they know how good it feels to wear a perfect-fitting pant with a little tennis top. \u201cThat\u2019s the key: confidence in being feminine,\u201d Miele Beard said. The Beards should push that sense of confidence even further; in the coming seasons, it would be interesting to hear a more thoughtful message in lieu of simply mining the past."}, {"Designer": "Nicholas K", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Sister-and-brother duo Nicholas and Christopher Kunz have become more accustomed to taking inspiration trips lately. They understand the importance of getting out and seeing the world, and that, even with a design sensibility that is minimal at its core, they often work best in a completely foreign, surprising setting. Whereas last season was focused on their own sustainable garden shed in upstate New York, Spring 2020 took cues from Spain. They showed their line, Nicholas K, during Barcelona Fashion Week in June, early enough so that they had time to really tweak and perfect the collection. While in Barcelona, they showed the clothes on a runway that ran through an old hospital once run by nuns in the 1900s. The new lineup is monastic\u2014beautiful long flowing silhouettes, with ultra-baggy cotton trousers, hand-dyed tunics, wrap tops, and draped, billowy dresses and jumpsuits. While in Spain, they happened upon an older, nomadic artist couple living and working in a convent in Malta. Introduced by mutual friends, the Kunzes saw images of the rustic, stone-walled space and knew almost immediately that they needed to visit and bring their new collection to be photographed there, in sticking with the nun-ish theme that gave them so much creative drive in Barcelona. The backdrop couldn\u2019t have been more perfect for their clothes, which are in part made sustainably (this is a huge driver for the label right now). As they move the brand forward, the Kunzes should indeed continue their design journeys and find more off-the-beaten-path places to showcase Nicholas K.

For spring 2020, the label is staking its claim to Americana with a collection that celebrates all things red, white, and blue. Patchwork tweeds evoke the flag, patriotic ginghams are cut into breezy skirts and dresses, and no less than the White House makes an appearance on a toile. In today\u2019s political climate, this is a pretty potent statement, but both creative director Zac Posen and the brand would like to stay away from any political interpretations. (Brooks is, probably, the rare retailer that wardrobes both sides of the aisle.) Reached over the phone to discuss the collection, Posen instead wanted to talk about all the posh, iconic American summer spots and what to wear there. Southampton, Nantucket, and Palm Beach are all mentioned alongside pale pink Brooks cool suiting, floral-embroidered sundresses, and nautically striped shifts. The silhouettes and flourishes Posen has brought to the label over the past several years have become, now, mainstays that sell and sell and sell. But he\u2019s still up for a little experimentation: Rich pearl and crystal embellishments line the collars and plackets of several pieces.

When you\u2019ve had certain production and manufacturing practices in place for years (or even decades), you can\u2019t just flip a switch and \u201cbecome sustainable\u201d overnight: Many of those changes are expensive and time-consuming. Maggie Marilyn is utterly chill about it, though, because she\u2019s been part of this movement since day one. (Though she wasn\u2019t always as vocal about it; when she launched back in 2016, her brand\u2019s buzzwords were affordable and romantic because the industry had yet to equate sustainability with vision or luxury.) Now in her third year, she\u2019s established her brand\u2019s visual language and is getting more ambitious about its environmental impact. Her North Star goal is for Maggie Marilyn to one day be a completely circular business, meaning customers can return clothes they\u2019re no longer wearing to be resold or repurposed into something else. Of course, nothing Marilyn has produced is particularly old or worn out yet; Spring 2020 is her ninth collection. As always, there were innovative materials like recycled polyester, organic cotton, and drapey Tencel, and she introduced linen for the very first time. \u201cIt always felt a little too earthy in the past,\u201d she said, pointing out her best-selling ruffled blazer in beige linen. But here, it lent some soft contrast to her more familiar bright pinks and periwinkles. Speaking of color, it was almost jarring to see so much black in her showroom: A twist-sleeve midi-dress from a prior collection reappeared in black satin, and a few looks were worthy of a red carpet, like a full strapless gown and a flared bustier over trousers. It\u2019s tempting to interpret a sense of doom and gloom in that shade, but Marilyn is an optimist; she was thinking more about how surprising and strong an all-black look feels in the springtime. (She probably has red carpets on the brain, too.) The other news for Spring was the utilitarian feel of a wide-leg khaki pant and the removable utility belts on miniskirts and button-downs. Marilyn says they\u2019ve afforded her the luxury of leaving home without a purse; she simply puts her phone, keys, and credit cards in her pocket. That kind of functionality is a selling point for busy women on the go, particularly here in New York. On that note, they\u2019ll be happy to know that Marilyn\u2019s newest blazer can be worn three ways: as a vest, a bolero, or together as the complete jacket.

The common sentiment is that they\u2019ll never go back; staging a show is expensive, stressful, and often wasteful while appointments are intimate, calm, and usually offer the chance to speak to more people. Tanya Taylor hosted runway shows and large-scale presentations for years but switched to a luncheon format in 2018. Held in the designer\u2019s own Nolita apartment, the lunches were a celebration of diversity, inclusivity, and female power, and they introduced fashion editors to women outside the industry who Taylor was inspired by, from tech founders to politicians to chefs\u2014each modeling a look from the new collection, of course. It was nice to see the clothes on real-life women who would actually wear them, but perhaps the gatherings were a little too exclusive; Taylor missed sharing the collection with the hundreds of people who frequented her \u201con-calendar\u201d events, so for Spring 2020, she was back at Spring Studios. The presentation was relatively by the book\u2014a colorful set, a couple dozen women wearing the collection\u2014but Taylor attempted to bridge the gap by casting models and non-models alike of diverse ages, sizes, and backgrounds. Maria Alia, a Palestinian-American influencer Taylor met on Instagram, wore a jacquard motorcycle jacket with an easy floral skirt; Pat Tracey, a model in her 60s, looked radiant in an open-back chartreuse jersey dress; and Stephanie Cavalli, a model and vintage dealer, will convince a lot of women to buy Taylor\u2019s sage jumpsuit, a utilitarian departure from her more romantic dresses and prints. It was one woman in particular who inspired all of those pieces: Barbara Hulanicki, the iconic founder of Biba. She wasn\u2019t present for the show, but Taylor met her in Miami earlier this year and was struck by the way Hulanicki\u2019s style combines her English roots with Miami\u2019s vibrant Art Deco scene. The hand-drawn flamingo prints were a cheeky nod to the city, and the supercharged tropical dresses will no doubt be popular with TT girls, but it was the slinky jersey dresses and crisp suits that felt compelling. Taylor should continue experimenting with those simpler items in the coming seasons\u2014and should consider pushing the boundaries of what a \u201cFashion Week presentation\u201d is by staging something a bit more interactive.

There is not a hint of novelty or nostalgia or trendiness, and that\u2019s probably why he has been able to sustain a healthy business for the past 20 years. Looking forward to Spring 2020, Azrou\u00ebl is sticking to what he knows best: architectural LBDs and skirts with hook-and-eye clasps at the seams, chic trench coats with paneling at the shoulders, and cool leather biker jackets. This season there were some animal prints too, but Azrou\u00ebl\u2019s latest collection was really a black-and-white-filtered homage to minimalism.

That\u2019s the 6397 proposition: The clothing comes second to the life you life in it, there to complement but not overpower it. In this area, few are on par with the considered, everyday wear made by Stella Ishii and her team. A gray single-button suit, worn in the lookbook by Clarissa Dalrymple, is slouchy and serious. A bandana print, thin-as-air button-up is a cool layering piece. A green railroad-stripe wrap skirt in denim is just slightly better than your average skirt. The brand has become so known for its best, most functionally brilliant pieces that they don\u2019t even need to appear in the lookbook: Where are the pull-on trousers? Not here! Those essential items have been weeded out from press fodder to make room for Ishii and company\u2019s big swings. This season, the first is a hard-core investment in rainbow-color madras, which appears in the collection as shirts, shorts, and wafting dresses. The second is a reversible jacquard French terry floral fabric that can be, as a blazer, at once lovely and a little horrendous. Last are silk pieces in rich olive green and electric violet. These stylistic departures might seem wild for a brand that once traded exclusively in jeans and tees, but they reflect the way life goes. Some days are loud, others are boring; but the best ones end up with you in a cool group of women, each with her own taste, gossiping over a bottle of wine.

The denim is still good\u2014really good, in fact, particularly spring 2020\u2019s high-rise, wide-leg flares. But unlike the designer denim labels BLDWN was formerly competing with, the focus is quite narrow; you won\u2019t find a stretchy skinny next to a cropped flare next to a distressed boyfriend jean just for the sake of having \u201csomething for everyone.\u201d Instead, there tends to be just a few key silhouettes and washes to choose from. Creative director Johnathan Crocker\u2014who has been guiding BLDWN\u2019s evolution alongside women\u2019s design director Shayla Guy\u2014added that you\u2019ll probably never see a ripped or shredded jean in the collection. They believe more strongly in polished, refined jeans, like those crisp wide-legs or a deep-rinse stovepipe. In a market of novelty jeans and denim suits, they stand out for their intentional lack of bells and whistles. That sense of elegance and ease was mirrored in the \u201cregular clothes,\u201d too, which revealed the duo\u2019s inspiration. They\u2019d been looking at Donald Judd\u2019s work in Marfa, Texas, but their version of the Western vibe was subtle. A crisp poplin button-down had stitch details around the yoke; leather trousers with suede patches were a modern take on chaps; and the palette of beige, poppy, and ivory evoked a Southern landscape. The best pieces were the ones that nodded more broadly to Judd\u2019s heyday in the \u201970s, like the ivory trousers in wide-wale corduroy with taupe stripes down the seams. Look closer and you\u2019ll notice the stripes are actually a slimmer, more compact type of corduroy, an ingenious tweak that lent a cleaner finish. It\u2019s that kind of thoughtfulness that makes BLDWN feel less like a denim brand and more like a cousin to one of America\u2019s other luxe, low-key labels, such as Khaite and Vince.

Since then, stylist Akeem Smith has stepped out of the shadows as Section 8\u2019s designer and has slowly been edging the brand into the spotlight. After taking a break from the Paris schedule where he showed his Spring collection last year, Smith joined hands with a community of talented young designers in New York, namely Vaquera and CDLM, for a group show in the Flat Iron district last night. Section 8 was first out of the gate, kicking off the proceedings with a Spring collection the designer called Problematic Princess. \u201cIt\u2019s that person who has a public opinion that everyone privately agrees with,\u201d said Smith, speaking backstage before the show.

Models came down the runway with second-skin fishnet body stockings layered under body-hugging crop tops and butterfly-shaped bras that were cut from the body. Smith isn\u2019t afraid to mine complicated sociopolitical subject matter for inspiration; lest we forget, the brand takes its name from the U.S. government\u2019s low-income housing voucher system. As part of his research for Spring, Smith paid a visit to the Jim Crow Museum, whose archive of racial propaganda is now being used as an educative tool to promote social justice. To wit, the bustled silhouette of the midi- and maxi-length skirts were a nod to the turn of the last century, when segregation laws were first enforced. Though the historical references were anything but literal, they resonated on a deeper level in the context of an all-black cast. The best looks in the collection managed to synthesize Smith\u2019s thought-provoking brew of influences, like the modest white handkerchief-hemline skirt that was gathered in gentle pleats at the hip and paired with a skin-revealing draped top.

With her distinctive take on artisanal Nigerian fabrics, the Lagos designer has amassed a small but highly engaged fan base. In her time off, Osakwe found some much-needed headspace. She began to see the wants and needs of the globally minded, artistically inclined women who wear her clothes with fresh eyes. There was indeed a subtle shift in direction evident in the clothes she showed today, from day to evening. As far as new inspiration goes, though, Osakwe always pulls from a disparate set of references. In fact, decoding the secret language of her prints is half the fun and has its roots in centuries-old Nigerian textile traditions: Consider that each of the patterns employed in adire, the indigo-dyeing technique she is known for, symbolizes something different. That said, the main touch point for the new collection\u2014The Boondocks, Cartoon Network\u2019s wildly popular animated adult sitcom\u2014might still throw you for a loop. After binge-watching the show a few months ago, Osakwe was drawn to the unabashed flashiness of Thugnificent and Gangstalicious, the two fashion-obsessed rappers who appear in the series. It\u2019s why the collection is particularly heavy on embellishments: pearls mostly, a modern alternative to old-school bling. Sprinkled along the shoulder of a slinky black jersey shirtdress and around the edge of shirt pockets, the effect was refreshingly chic. What\u2019s more, those body-skimming LBDs had a sense of ease that some of her more complicated, architectural shapes have lacked in the past. Tiwa Savage, the hugely popular Nigerian singer who sat in the front row at the show yesterday evening, clearly had her eye on those new designs. With an Instagram following in the millions, Savage doesn\u2019t take the platform she\u2019s been afforded for granted. She understands that when it comes to representation, fashion choices matter.

The airy, lime green organza trench coat that hugged one of their bandage dresses was uncharted territory for the duo, however. Cheng notes that the two felt a bit unsure of its standout ruched sleeves, but they decided to go for it in the end. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hold back,\u201d Gauntlett said. The two say their pieces are always grounded in whatever their distinct moods might be during the design process, but any anxiety or stress that seeped into past seasons seemed to have dissipated. \u201cI think more than anything we wanted to do something that felt like the two of us,\u201d Gauntlett says. \u201cWhat do we want to wear?

What was our summer like?\u201d During the finale this season, in lieu of tears and Dido, Gauntlett and Cheng spiritedly walked out to No Doubt\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s My Life.\u201d This time, they were all smiles."}, {"Designer": "Tom Ford", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "How many times have you heard that the streets of New York are a runway? Well, the same is true of the subway, only maybe more so. There\u2019s glamour and grit down there, same as above ground, but down below there\u2019s a captive audience. Tom Ford is the new chairman of the CFDA, and after starting in June his first move was to shorten New York Fashion Week. Simultaneous with the consolidation, designers have been producing more experiential events. We\u2019ve seen bands, modern dancers, and a 75-person choir this week, but only Ford arranged for a private viewing of a disused platform of the Bowery stop on the J/Z line lit an electric pink for the occasion. Many of his 180 guests were surely subway first-timers, but the regular commuters got a big kick out of it too. What is Mr. Slick doing in the subway? Ford\u2019s notes made mention of the famous shot of Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick emerging out of a manhole cover. The subway also jibes with his new-since-last-season interest in simplicity. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a time for ease,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand in that way a return to the kind of luxurious sportswear that America has become known for all over the world.\u201d Enter look one: a jersey scoop-neck tee with the short sleeves rolled up to the shoulders and a duchesse satin skirt so white it was beaming. Not exactly subway-safe, it was low-key fabulous and synthesized the compelling high-low essence of the collection. Or consider another example: satin blazers cut characteristically strong and worn with elastic-waist nylon basketball shorts. \u201cThese torture me,\u201d Ford wrote of the shorts, pointing out that he doesn\u2019t let his son Jack wear them, even though his classmates do. \u201cI\u2019m always fascinated by things that \u2018torture me.\u2019\u201d Ford didn\u2019t play it completely contrary, though. The molded plastic tops were a luscious homage to Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s Lalanne breastplates via Issey Miyake. And Ford\u2019s tailored men\u2019s jackets were typically loud and louche. Connecting with one of the key messages of the season so far\u2014let\u2019s call it the nearly naked trend, for now\u2014Ford threw a dress coat over a leather bra, cut a jumpsuit so it fell open to expose a strappy bikini top, and sent out a pair of slinky maillots. Of course, the millennial designers doing the same have probably been studying Ford\u2019s old Gucci shows. That legacy of great American sportswear Ford was talking about? He has a stake in it. What\u2019s new is old, that\u2019s just how fashion works. Credit Ford, he\u2019s expanding his vocabulary."}, {"Designer": "The Row", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Once again Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen showed their latest collection for The Row at their Greenwich Street studio, a stark white space unadorned except for the two monastic benches which ran the length of the room and the handsome bunch of waiters who served coffee poured into earthy cream ceramic tumblers. (I could wax lyrical about the lofty, zen-like qualities of those cups for aaaaages, but I won\u2019t, you\u2019ll be thrilled to know.) The calm and clean rigor of the venue only served to focus the mind on the clothes; if there was any distraction going on, you could only level that accusation against the show\u2019s soul soundtrack, but then again, that was totally brilliant, and toes were merrily tapped away as the terrific clothes came slowly and purposefully walking by. Slow and purposeful could also be the mantra of what the Olsens showed. If you usually love what they do\u2014and really, name me someone who doesn\u2019t; I\u2019ll wait\u2014then there was plenty of comforting familiarity here with just enough newness to make you reexamine in a fresh light The Row\u2019s stock in trade, which is the ne plus ultra rendering of the ideal, timeless wardrobe. For next Spring, that meant they aligned their reductive tendencies\u2014minimalist black jackets and lean-ish pants galore, perfection in tailored form and now leavened with a fresh athletic twist of zippered fastenings, pannier pockets, and substantial, strapped-leather Tevas\u2014with some of their more whimsical yearnings. Those took the form of petal-light floral cutouts, in organza or velvet, embellishing several of their closing looks; they were particularly good on a corset-close sculpted black top and a pair of equally noirish cropped wide trousers, worn rather insouciantly with an untucked crisp cotton shirt as blue as the sky on a perfect New York September day. Actually, there have been plenty of opportunities to sit and look at perfect blue September skies, not to mention storied venues (a museum, a theater, a courthouse) these past few days. Many of New York\u2019s designers have built experiential settings into their shows, giving a transportive quality to their presentations which can be pretty powerful and which has seen the city steal a march on its European counterparts. I wasn\u2019t the only one at The Row, I am sure, who was still on soaring spirits mode after sitting through Kerby Jean-Raymond\u2019s breathtaking Pyer Moss show at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn the night before. You could argue that the Olsens too could put what they do into some kind of setting that\u2019s beyond the white box, especially when one considers the immersive pleasure to be had from their stores in both Los Angeles and New York, because the backdrops of so many shows have been able to bring a tangible sense of real life to a world beyond the runway. And yet, on the other hand, perhaps not. The Row gives such a connection to the lives, real and imagined, external and internal, of so many women that this is the rare case where the setting is irrelevant."}, {"Designer": "Zero + Maria Cornejo", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The British television series Victoria, of all things, sparked Maria Cornejo\u2019s Spring collection. Anyone who follows the designer\u2019s work will know how unlikely that is. A contemporary artist, a vocal feminist, the brilliant choreographer Pina Bausch\u2014that\u2019s the kind of person Cornejo usually quotes, if she quotes anyone at all. Queen Victoria of the corsets and gowns? Surprising. The designer became taken with the show, she explained, because Victoria\u2019s era was \u201can age of possibility and innocence\u2014such a contradiction of what\u2019s going on now.\u201d You\u2019d never see the reference if you hadn\u2019t been told, but armed with the information it wasn\u2019t hard to make a connection beyond the beauty marks penciled onto some of the models\u2019 cheeks. Queen Victoria wore her corsets under her clothes; Cornejo reimagined hers as midriff-spanning wrap belts that accessorized some of the jackets and coats. These weren\u2019t armaments of constraint as the women of that long-ago time might have considered them; here they were more decorative, adding an element of sensuality that felt exploratory and new. That sense of experimentation extended to a polka-dot grouping. Polka dots are another fairly unlikely sighting, predictable to the point of banality, but these had a nice graphic pop in navy and white and a more girlish orangey pink. Last week Cornejo celebrated a collaboration with Hyundai in which she developed some of her signature sculptural silhouettes out of car-seat waste. Here, she used recycled polyester pliss\u00e9 raincoating for a voluminous jacket and skirt. The polka dots were made in an organic cotton/recycled poly jacquard. Back to Victoria and the idea of possibility: Cornejo is making her own."}, {"Designer": "Co", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Co designers Stephanie Danan and Justin Kern aren\u2019t the kind to make a song and dance during Fashion Week. The Los Angeles\u2013based duo has amassed a significant following over the years with a remarkably stealth approach to brand building. \u201cThe more fashion is making noise, the more this idea of quietness is resonating with us,\u201d said Danan. Hosted in a showroom adjacent to the frenzy of shows at Spring Studios, their new collection spoke to the core values they\u2019ve been honing over the past two years. \u201cIntellectual sportswear but with an edge,\u201d was how Danan summed it up. With monastic silhouettes and slouchy suiting in muted colors, Danan and Kern have found their sweet spot. Saskia de Brauw, the gorgeous 38-year-old model and artist who stars in Co\u2019s new lookbook, embodied that cool and considered sense of luxury. The tunics layered over pants, chunky Birkenstock-style slides, and oversize totes are likely to curry favor with women still seeking to fill the hole left behind by Phoebe Philo\u2019s departure from Celine. Danan and Kern were once known for their elaborate brocades and prints, though these days they\u2019re working with a much more pared-back canvas. The most compelling pieces in the collection showcased that new simplicity. Take the crisp balloon skirts nipped at the ankle with drawstrings that were styled over coordinating shirtdresses, a layered look that felt fresh for the brand. Building on the success of its handbag and shoe business, Co partnered with L.A. artisanal eyewear label Jacques Marie Mage on a collection of minimalist sunglasses. With its sights set on expansion, Co is subtly making space for a new kind of sophisticated SoCal style."}, {"Designer": "Alice + Olivia", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The Alice + Olivia presentation was a bit chaotic. Designer Stacey Bendet was caught up in the mashed-together crowd, trying hard to make it over to Sophia Richie, who had just walked in. Swarms of people gathered around them while the other human clusters stood in front of the multiple displays set up around the garage-style gallery space, trying eagerly to snap Instagram shots of the models wearing the Spring 2020 collection. But this is how it usually goes with a Bendet production. Every season, the Alice + Olivia shows are wildly adorable and highly impressive in terms of how much thought and detail go into the elaborate sets, each a little vignette representing the narrative of that given season. It gets crowded, sure, but that\u2019s part of the ethos of the brand: Make a statement, go big, and have fun. As so many designers are currently thinking about switching up their traditional runway formats and opting for something more experiential, perhaps Bendet might think about doing the opposite. She\u2019s been creating scenes and events for Alice + Olivia for quite some time now, and it would be refreshing to see her designs move and twirl and come even more alive in a proper show space. Especially her latest offering, which was focused on neon color-blocking and stronger, less precious, and flouncy silhouettes. Bendet\u2019s suiting is getting stronger each season, and so is her attention to balancing out everyday separates with the A+O\u2013fabulous cocktail and evening dresses. She played with prints still, and she also tapped streetwear designer EV Bravado for a custom spray-paint print on denim. But it was tricky to really take in this newer, more streamlined story because of the presentation\u2019s setup. It\u2019s great that Bendet can still draw a huge crowd during a Fashion Week that has waned in excitement for many. That being said, it would be interesting to see her switch things up and send her playful world bouncing down a runway."}, {"Designer": "Sandy Liang", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Yesterday, Sandy Liang executed her very first runway show. She dabbled in this format last season, presenting her namesake label with models walking in and out of a gallery space, but this time around it was the real deal. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I never did a show,\u201d a cool, calm, and collected Liang said once it was all over. It\u2019s true that the designer\u2019s wares have long deserved their own runway because, ultimately, Liang\u2019s is a label all about swagger. Aside from the high-quality factor, much of the appeal of her clothes comes from imagining a painfully cool artist, chef, or musician strolling around downtown New York in one of her sheer baby doll dresses or color-blocked neon fleeces. And plenty of them do, especially Liang\u2019s muses, who hang out with her and pose for her lookbooks, which are usually shot in and around Chinatown and the Lower East Side, where she lives and works. That crowd not only came to sit front row at Liang\u2019s first show, some modeled on the runway too. Mission Chinese\u2019s chef and cofounder wore the opening look well: a cropped bomber jacket left unzipped to reveal his chest tattoos and black jeans with a train of black tulle fabric hanging from the back. Other Liang-ites on the catwalk were decked out in a cropped gingham peasant top, a tiered-ruffle flamenco skirt, and a Peter Pan\u2013collar dress with ruching at the bodice. The garter-belt tops and dresses gave a sexier vibe to the lineup, and so did the baby tee\u2013inspired shirtdress that clung to the body. There was a lot more monochrome white than Liang usually shows, but these pieces sat nicely with the nostalgic, childlike aesthetic that she is always trying to capture. So too did her debut jewelry collection, which she said was inspired by the little heart cases that her Polly Pockets came in when she was a kid. Liang will always be looking backward in an effort to move her brand forward, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with a designer holding tight to notions of days gone by. But she\u2019s definitely growing up and evolving, so much so that she mentioned the Spring 2020 offering was tinged with \u201ca little sadness\u201d for her. She was missing her carefree childhood, the days when she didn\u2019t have to think about seasonal deliveries and market appointments. But she was thrilled to have finally shown her work on a runway. In that regard, she was happy to embrace being a bit older and a bit wiser."}, {"Designer": "Gypsy Sport", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Life is not always a beach for young designers trying to make it in fashion, and Rio Uribe of Gypsy Sport would know. Over the past six years he\u2019s successfully navigated the changing tides of the industry, running a fully independent business with unwavering commitment. Still, when it\u2019s all work and no play, there\u2019s not much room left for creative daydreaming. Which is why, these days, Uribe is making a conscious effort to make more time for himself. With palms tree lining the runway, that joyous out-of-office attitude was in the air at his show today. Showgoers at the rooftop venue were clearly feeling the vibe, too, and sipped on fruit cocktails in the warm Indian summer evening. The sunset tangerine and canary yellow palette of the clothes spoke directly to a permanent vacation mood. Shimmying out while covered in sparkling gold body paint, the first model set the tone, flaunting a party-starting halter-neck dress fashioned from hundreds of beaded safety pins. That ingenious approach to chainmail is one Uribe has been evolving for the past few seasons and is proving surprisingly popular despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014its unabashed fashion-forward sensibility. Uribe made sustainability part of his agenda early on and is now focused on honing signature DIY archetypes. An update on the terrific denim he showed for Spring 2019, the new jeans had an appealing tropical look thanks to the appliqu\u00e9 hibiscus flowers. The safety pin-studded Bermuda shorts were a showstopper when they were first worn by rapper Rico Nasty last season and are likely to be a hit in this new one. In a moment when the notion of luxury is being reevaluated altogether, Uribe\u2019s soulful one-of-a-kind pieces are a sunny proposition."}, {"Designer": "Rosie Assoulin", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Rosie Assoulin wrote the book on statement tops, but the one that stood out most in her Spring 2020 presentation was undeniably simple: a crisp white cotton shirt unbuttoned to reveal a matching bra underneath. Look closer, though, and you\u2019ll notice the two pieces were actually connected. Assoulin devised an ingenious hook-and-eye closure so it won\u2019t fly open when you bend down or catch a breeze. (A ring in the center of the bra loops into a slit in the shirt\u2019s placket.) It was covered-up and polished with just a touch of sensuality, and was one of the many examples of \u201cbuilt-in styling\u201d Assoulin created for Spring. A turquoise plaid maxi skirt came with bloomers underneath, for instance, and there was a midi dress that appeared to have multiple pieces\u2014a sheer camisole, a triangle bra, and a full skirt\u2014fused together. On a belted safari jacket, she bypassed the issue of excess fabric bunching up around the waist by slashing a vent just under the rib cage, revealing just a flash of skin. In short, she wants to make it easier for her customers to get dressed; they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about their underpinnings or how to \u201cpull something off.\u201d Not every look was hybridized, and the ones that weren\u2019t occupied two extremes: the seriously pared-back pieces, like a black poplin midi dress with cut-outs along the rib cage, and the fanciful stuff we typically associate with Assoulin, like a pale orange off-the-shoulder evening gown paired with blush trousers. She said the colors were lifted from the fruit she ate this summer, such as cantaloupe and watermelon; sometimes a good idea really is that simple. It was more of a coincidence that the collection\u2019s bright greens, lemons, and corals were reflected in the vegetables displayed on a table in Bocce Union Square, where Assoulin hosted her presentation. Guests took home jars of DIY pickled veggies to snack on that evening, an activity just quirky enough to feel totally right for Assoulin."}, {"Designer": "Anna Sui", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Escapism is only as good as where it gets you. For several seasons now, the idea of getting away from it all has inspired fashion designers to dream up collections about Morocco, Japan, the Mediterranean, the South of France, and dozens of other seaside locales. But Anna Sui is not like the others. What was offered on her Spring 2020 runway tonight was definitely a kind of escapism, but instead of flying off to a faraway destination, Sui escaped her models to a new state of mind. No pop, no punk, no psychedelia, and no new wave here\u2014Spring 2020, as Sui explained in a preview, was about unabashed, whimsical femininity, light as air and frothing with sweetness. Her key reference was the mid-20th-century artist Lila de Nobili. A costume designer, set designer, and illustrator, de Nobili operated with a lively hand, rendering women like fanciful poufs of cotton candy. That unbearable lightness was what Sui wanted to capture with her chiffon dresses this season, layered over pants or under vests, like a modern mille-feuille of delicious design. (Cupcakes decorated like roses and succulents were also on the mood board, to hammer home the sweet tooth plot.) Victoriana was in the mix too, taking the form of pouf-sleeved mesh tops, bitsy tanks with beaded embellishment that evoked corset covers, and one adorable chambray set trimmed with tiny bows. The best dress by Sui\u2019s own measure\u2014and mine\u2014was a mash-up of pale pink and blue prints collaged into a long tunic. It was so irresistibly breathy that as Felice Noordhoff walked, you couldn\u2019t help but think it might just waft away. Even with their platform shoes and quirky socks, Sui\u2019s women still felt confident, aggressive, and sure-shot this season. Her product offering remained as diverse as ever, too. In addition to the lovely seafoam caftans and ethereal broderie anglaise minis, Sui whipped up coated chiffon windbreakers in delicate prints and tomboy-ish khakis and army jackets. Picnic blanket ginghams, rich neon-flecked tweeds, and checked knitwear fleshed out the full scope of the Sui world this season. At a preview, Sui admitted that her decidedly delicate theme was a challenge, calling Spring an \u201cexercise for me to change the headspace.\u201d It might be a challenge to women too; I don\u2019t mean that as a bad thing. Set to the bluesy crooning of artists as diverse as Jessica Pratt and Blind Faith, this collection asked questions about contradiction: how to simultaneously be layered and light, how to feel protected and practical while still utterly free, how to be completely yourself and completely at ease in the world. There\u2019s no simple answer, but Sui and her earthbound ethereality posited some great ideas."}, {"Designer": "Maryam Nassir Zadeh", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Maryam Nassir Zadeh staged her Spring 2020 show on a sunken court in Sara D. Roosevelt Park, also known as the strip of land between Forsyth and Christie Streets on the Lower East Side. On a typical Monday afternoon you\u2019d find kids playing bike polo or a group of ladies practicing tai chi; instead, editors sat on folding chairs while Susan Cianciolo, Nane Feist, and Lili Sumner glided past in neon bikinis, loose cargo pants, and ultramini miniskirts. This wasn\u2019t a \u201cguerrilla show\u201d like Zadeh\u2019s Spring 2018 outing on the East River track, but there was a similar feeling of interrupting daily life. A few guys continued to kick a soccer ball on the opposite side of the park, while unsuspecting pedestrians paused to watch from the sidewalk. (One Vogue editor who got there at the last minute simply found an empty park bench; the views were more or less the same.) Zadeh\u2019s show has become one of New York Fashion Week\u2019s can\u2019t-miss events, so some guests were probably wondering why she hasn\u2019t upgraded to a slicker venue yet. But the distinctly unrefined setting of cracked asphalt is part of the MNZ story, a reminder that she\u2019s still one of downtown New York\u2019s O.G. talents; seeing this collection at Spring Studios simply wouldn\u2019t compute. Her models looked right at home in the fresh LES air, probably because they actually were. After the show, Zadeh cited her usual stream-of-consciousness references: menswear, raves, safari suits, the beach, and John Cassavetes films, plus new touches of romance via ruffles and lace (she even closed with a bride in white ruched satin, a cheeky nod to traditional couture shows). Those concepts sound simple enough, but the MNZ way is to make them certifiably strange. Zadeh explained that she didn\u2019t want her floral prints to reference blooms you\u2019d find in a garden\u2014instead they were more akin to underwater plants. Her signature glass jewelry was shaped like Posidonia, a type of seagrass that creates so much oxygen it\u2019s considered the lungs of the Mediterranean. Zadeh is happiest by the water; she recently returned from Formentera, Spain, and likes to wear swimsuits as \u201creal clothes,\u201d reflected in the string bikinis-as-bras in the show. She had late-night beach parties in mind when she designed the floaty patchwork skirts and up-to-there minis, but it\u2019s the latter that felt truly surprising. After years of midi and floor-skimming hemlines, she wanted something crazy-short (then balanced it out with a blousy button-down). It\u2019s one of those things that just suddenly, inexplicably looks right, and if Zadeh\u2019s feeling it, you can bet other women will soon enough."}, {"Designer": "3.1 Phillip Lim", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "It has been years since Phillip Lim staged a coed show, and he marked the occasion by choosing a new venue for Spring 2020: an open-air warehouse in Greenpoint. Despite the agonizing traffic to and from the Brooklyn neighborhood\u2014this reviewer barely made it in time from the Lower East Side\u2014the vibe mirrored that of his Spring collection: urban yet somehow tranquil. Backstage, Lim was talking about his brand\u2019s values\u2014community, diversity, optimism\u2014and his efforts to pare things back and create items with a clear purpose. His experiments with tailoring were Spring\u2019s highlights. You won\u2019t find a conventional two-piece suit here; there are enough of those to go around, for starters, and Lim saw an opportunity to create something different for his clients. His most intriguing proposition was a sleeveless, elongated vest with a detachable piece draped around the shoulders, sort of like a scarf; styled with matching trousers or a flow-y midi skirt, the combination was boundary pushing without being too outr\u00e9 for a typical New York office. (Lim knows precisely who his customers are: working women across a variety of fields.) The same was true of an asymmetrical blazer with sleek cutouts and a detachable hood, as well as a jacket shown with a leather bandana\u2014a clever accessory wearers will be happy to play around with. Earlier this summer, Lim debuted a Resort collection that was 40 percent sustainable thanks to new organic and recycled fabrics. He continued those efforts here, pointing out the compact organic cotton of a chocolate brown jumpsuit and the coated cupro of a navy midi dress. It had a liquid-y gleam from afar, like heavyweight satin, and in photos it reads almost as leather, but cupro is made from upcycled cotton waste. Materials aside, designing with intention is a smaller yet crucial part of the sustainability conversation. By nixing the unnecessary bells and whistles, Lim hopes to create pieces with serious longevity. Any designer can source better fabrics, but few can resist the urge to complicate their clothes. Going forward, it would be great to see Lim become a louder voice in the sustainability conversation; as he enters his 15th year in business, it will be an important part of maintaining his momentum and staying competitive with the very woke new guard."}, {"Designer": "Lela Rose", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "One of the big, agenda-setting themes of New York Fashion Week has been the evolution of the runway show as experience. A few designers have set the bar extremely high, like Ralph Lauren, who invited guests to a black-tie dinner complete with a performance by Janelle Mon\u00e1e. Smaller designers are getting in on it too, like Collina Strada\u2019s Hillary Taymour, who brought a farmers market to Gramercy Park, and Susan Alexandra, who invited friends and iconic drag stars to a \u201cbat mitzvah\u201d party. This is hardly news to Lela Rose, of course. She\u2019s hosted garden parties in the West Village, taken over a Grand Banks boat for happy hour, and even staged a \u201cdog show\u201d for Fall 2019, with models accompanied by Insta-famous pups. It all stems from Rose\u2019s own genuine love of entertaining: She understood the uplifting power of a gorgeous atmosphere, a live band, and a delicious snack before most of her peers. Impressively, Rose has almost never repeated a venue. For Spring 2020, she set up caf\u00e9 tables along a row of benches in Hudson River Park, scattering yellow rose petals in lieu of a runway. Models glided past (slowly and smiling!) in whisper-sheer tulle gowns, open-back shirtdresses with New York\u2013skyline prints, and fine-knit columns, with a live soundtrack by a trio of musicians. Rose wanted it to feel akin to sitting at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 and watching stylish women go by (in New York, for the record\u2014not Paris). The gently cinched midi-dresses\u2014one in sheer, rose-printed cotton and puffed sleeves, another with knife pleats and a floral-printed lace\u2014are the kind that would make you stop and ask a girl where she got it. But the looks that will shock Rose\u2019s customers most were the ones with flashes of midriff: A blush poplin midiskirt was styled with a matching jacket and bralette, and another look combined a white ruffly mini with a crisp button-down unbuttoned over a bra. They might feel risky to buyers who are more accustomed to Rose\u2019s tea dresses and gowns, but this is a trend we\u2019ve been seeing a lot this week\u2014and it might just inspire a new wave of young women to shop with Rose for the first time."}, {"Designer": "Barrag\u00e1n", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The label by Mexico City native CVFF nominee Victor Barrag\u00e1n brought a wild, full life to the sterile Spring Studios today. The designer is deeply invested in importing Mexican culture, his Mexican culture to be exact, to New York. And Barrag\u00e1n\u2019s Mexico City is fun. It\u2019s a brewing youthquake. Dewy faced models stepped out bleary eyed, covered in hickies, as if they had just returned from a club at 5 a.m. Their patchwork denim pants barely stayed on and their cropped T-shirts were ripped. A clingy, off-the-shoulder knit dress was see-through. At first I thought a blazing red hickey on the third model\u2019s neck was from a sassy late night out, but in fact the passion bruise was created by artist Marcelo Gutierrez. Barrag\u00e1n has long celebrated the Mexico club kid look and its nuances. Downtown New York, Berlin, and London are often what come to mind when thinking about club culture, but Mexico City has a thriving scene of its own. The signature style of sagging pants were made from delicious leather with pockets at the knees. One buff dude wore a T-shirt with a huge upside-down question mark made up of \u201cBarrag\u00e1n\u201d spelled out over and over again. It had a rip across the chest to artfully reveal a slice of hairy chest, almost as if it had been torn by a lover. Barrag\u00e1n\u2019s clothes have a knack for making someone feel hot and young again, like they\u2019ve been making out in the backseat of a car for hours and magically look really good the morning after. But kids aside, this brand isn\u2019t just for New York\u2019s downtown youth. Nor is it only for the youth of Mexico City. While there are the fun pieces, like a semi-sheer tangerine mini skirt that covers much of nothing, Barrag\u00e1n is a serious guy. His clothes employ a highly skilled hand that knows just how low a pair of pants should sit and just how boxy the shoulders of a jacket should stand. One model, Coco Mitchell, the gorgeous adult of the bunch, brought Barrag\u00e1n\u2019s skilled leatherwork to life. She wore a pair of high-waisted leather pants in swirling bark brown and chocolate hues with a slightly distressed varnish. They were anchored by a huge belt and a hulking metal buckle. That was all tailored and chic and very Instagrammable, especially thanks to the deer-print, pony hair-mules with a sharp, square toe. Barrag\u00e1n\u2019s arrival to the New York industry and his CVFF nomination is an important moment for the designer\u2019s career, but also for Mexico. The industry in Mexico City is booming with underground designers. In the States, there are plenty of mangled views of Mexico and anything south of the border. There is vitriolic talk of walls and a bubbling feeling of xenophobia. Barrag\u00e1n shows just how cool things can get without constraints."}, {"Designer": "Zimmermann", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Backstage after Nicky Zimmermann\u2019s Spring 2020 runway show today, she was struggling to describe a certain feeling. The designer was talking about how this season she was inspired by the dreamy, summery mood from her memory of being a young girl growing up in the suburbs of Sydney, Australia. She remembered the final days before her primary school let out for the holiday break, and the fact that during the long-awaited countdown to freedom, she and her classmates didn\u2019t do much school work at all. In America, we sometimes call that lack of motivation ahead of graduation \u201csenioritis.\u201d The word refers to kicking back, relishing the work you\u2019ve done all year and how good it will feel to be free of books, deadlines, and letter grades. Zimmermann recalled one instance when a teacher let her and her classmates watch 1966 surf documentary The Endless Summer, which not only kept kids entertained while they awaited the final bell, but also got them even more excited for the break. No matter the season, Zimmermann\u2019s collections have a way of getting everyone excited for summer. Her core designs are pure beach-chic porn: tiered ruffles, mini hemlines, pouf sleeves, plenty of eyelet. Zimmermann showed that today too, but what was more impressive was how she swerved over into a new summertime aesthetic that was a little less sweet. The designer showcased a new series of prints made from retro surf posters, which landed on cool maxi skirts, crop tops, and a covetable strapless dress. Weaving these more graphic prints into her repertoire was a smart move. There were pieces to play with and style, rather than just throwing on one of her bohemian day-to-night dresses and hitting the sand. Summer ended last weekend with Labor Day, but Zimmermann\u2019s Spring wares made it seem like it was just around the corner again. The audience at today\u2019s show looked joyful at the thought of having their own grown-up version of senioritis and dreaming of more beach days ahead."}, {"Designer": "Jonathan Simkhai", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Just as some people are righties and others lefties, so many designers have a preferred season. Unsurprisingly, the Los Angeles\u2013based Jonathan Simkhai describes himself as a \u201cspring.\u201d \u201cI embody that,\u201d he said preshow. \u201cI always feel happy in spring, and I think that that joyfulness is something I can give to the clothes.\u201d Even if Simkhai hadn\u2019t shown his new collection on a rooftop bathed in sunshine, his clothes would still radiate softness and femininity of form, hue, and treatments. The designer\u2019s palette was informed by the work of Georgia O\u2019Keeffe; his focus on intricate pleating nodded to Madame Gr\u00e8s. Having had great success with his slip dresses, Simkhai stuck with them this season. With details like hand-pleating (the work of angels), lace insets, grosgrain back ties, and lingerie buttons, these iterations were less Courtney Love than they were Jean Harlow. It should be noted that there were as many treatments applied to the back of the garments (the subject of a current exhibition in Paris, by the way), as there were to the front. Simkhai\u2019s slip dresses might have borrowed from the bedroom, but it was entirely possible to imagine them being worn with flat sandals and a cardigan at a farmers market, or perhaps with delicate heels to a summer wedding. A nice extension of the slip theme was a billowing parachute dress. Simkhai, who\u2019s partial to dichotomies, balanced flou with tailored pieces like a coatdress, a pleated trench, and a smart ivory pantsuit with a draped cutout back that demonstrated the \u201cunexpected femininity\u201d he stated was central to the brand\u2019s ethos. Overall, Simkhai\u2019s show was a shining example of his skill\u2014with one caveat. The proceedings would have benefited from a casting that showed the designer\u2019s pastel confections skimming over curvy figures as well as straight ones."}, {"Designer": "Nanette Lepore", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Nanette Lepore was one of the first shows I attended when I was interning for a glossy magazine back in 2011. I was overwhelmed by the commotion backstage, the lines for interviews, the models in hair and makeup. I was swept away! At the time, I already knew about Lepore\u2019s work: In a small town in Massachusetts, my mother had managed to scoop a few pieces, like a knit cardigan and a pert jacket. Lepore has considerably pared back her showing style over the last eight years. And to be fair, with shrinking budgets and rising production costs, what label\u2019s presenting methods haven\u2019t become less about the bells and whistles? Since I\u2019ve been reviewing Lepore over the past four years, save for one presentation, she has shown her collection in her art-dotted home or in her studio, which has since moved to the Navy Yard. When she shows in her home, as she did this time, sans the glitz, it feels endearingly personal. It is evident that Lepore isn\u2019t trying to impress anyone, and she even explicitly stated that this season: \u201cWe just had a lot of fun making clothes this time. I\u2019m done trying to please buyers and people. We want to make what we want to wear,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are doing this the way that we want to do it. I don\u2019t care anymore about trying to hit somebody\u2019s markdown schedule; it\u2019s just impossible. Now, you just have to do what you love, which is how we are going.\u201d Lepore certainly did what she loved, and she radiated those feel-good vibes. She enlisted daughter Violet Savage to model the clothes, and Savage\u2019s photographer boyfriend, fellow Bard student Lucas Bourgine, styled and shot the look book. Lepore had let them be while she cooked chili downstairs (it\u2019s her daughter\u2019s favorite). The result was refreshing. Lepore\u2019s clothes, always print-forward with a flirty ruffle, looked great on her daughter. Young people will like the tiny cropped zebra-stripes jacket. Women of all ages will adore the optic white suit that Bourgine styled with Lepore\u2019s own silver conch shell belt. The Hawaiian-print shirt was full of funk, and while at first glance it may have felt awkward when paired with a tweed suit, it actually fit together quite coolly. In the end, letting go, or rather, relaxing, is a really good look for Lepore."}, {"Designer": "Nili Lotan", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Nili Lotan is often the first to say her clothes don\u2019t have a lot of hanger appeal. The real essence of her label comes down to how the pieces are actually worn by the NL woman. Lotan herself is the ultimate example: She starts each collection by thinking about what\u2019s missing in her wardrobe and what feels right, and her brand\u2019s consistent growth suggests there\u2019s an increasing number of women who want to follow her instincts. Spring 2020 had many of the core pieces you expect from Lotan\u2014the slouchy pants, silky button-downs, and low-key tailoring\u2014but was in many ways an extension of her decadent, embellishment-heavy Resort collection. Both seasons took their cues from Jimi Hendrix and Keith Richards\u2019s onstage style, namely the embellished vests and silky blouses. Lotan doesn\u2019t really do menswear, save for a few collaborations here and there, but the vibe feels right for the current moment, when rockstars and regular guys alike are rethinking the codes of \u201cmasculinity.\u201d It\u2019s easy to picture Harry Styles picking up one of those spangly jackets, or even a satin blouse with a few buttons left undone. Those glam black-and-gold pieces made up half of the collection, and the other was entirely white and beige. These were the more casual, rumpled items Lotan envisioned packing in a suitcase for a trip to Morocco: On an exceptionally hot day in Manhattan, the cream caftan with embroidered trim looked surprisingly fresh (and so much more original than the New Yorker\u2019s go-to slip), and Lotan introduced a relaxed short suit in sand linen. They brought a new, earthy-yet-refined sensibility to Lotan\u2019s repertoire of button-downs and cargos, though her most devoted customers will be more excited to try out her latest pant: a super-full, rounded pair that tapered just above the ankle."}, {"Designer": "Rebecca Taylor", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Last month Rebecca Taylor announced she was leaving the brand she founded in 1997. It was a surprise, but also not really; after moving her family to Paris last year to fulfill a lifelong dream of living there, Taylor was finding inspiration daily, particularly in the city\u2019s art galleries. She has tons of other creative ideas she wants to pursue. On a recent call, she said she\u2019d been thinking a lot about designing clothes for women like her, working mothers over 40. That\u2019s likely years down the road; in the meantime, she\u2019s enjoying spending time off with her kids. The company announced its new creative director right before Fashion Week: Emily Craig, Taylor\u2019s former head of design. They worked on the spring 2020 collection together, and in many ways, it was classic RT: lots of ruffles, florals, and eyelet, but Craig pointed out a few new ideas. A semi-sheer pointelle knit dress brought a vaguely beachy touch to the lineup (it felt even more SoCal with an ombr\u00e9 knit on top), and while the poplin bralettes under jackets weren\u2019t a brand-new concept for the label, they\u2019ll find a new audience as the trend picks up this week. Craig\u2019s challenge going forward will be to continue differentiating the three lines under the RT umbrella: the main Rebecca Taylor, La Vie Rebecca Taylor (its lower-priced, more casual sister), and, as of this past March, Tailored Rebecca Taylor, which focuses on 9-to-5 suiting and separates. Utility pants are a La Vie signature at this point, so Craig was careful to make the patchwork lilac trousers here feel a bit more polished. Similarly, now that blazers are taken care of in Tailored, she traded spring\u2019s usual puff-sleeve blazers for novelty knitwear and leather jackets. Over the next few seasons, it will be interesting to see how Craig puts her own stamp on things; it\u2019s one thing to mine a founder\u2019s archives, but quite another to keep up the momentum and introduce considerable newness."}, {"Designer": "Norma Kamali", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "We\u2019re desperately in need of a scale against which to measure brands\u2019 sustainability; in the meantime, there\u2019s always the test of time. \u201cI think the comment I hear most,\u201d said Norma Kamali, \u201cis, \u2018Oh, I still have your\u2026[whatever].\u2019 It really does make me feel great to think [that something I designed a long time ago] is still in their wardrobe.\u201d Kamali\u2019s catalog is so large and so adaptable, if she didn\u2019t get bored easily, she could just rest on her laurels. Timing is an art, and of late, many of the designer\u2019s rereleases are dictated by which of her vintage pieces are trending on Instagram; hence the reappearance of the Puli jumpsuit (Look 59) for Spring. Last Fall, Kamali revisited her \u201cModern Sculpture\u201d dress\u2014a tube separated from its connected sleeves by giant round cutouts\u2014sort of like a Henry Moore sculpture. Beyonc\u00e9 and her team saw it and ordered customized versions for the \u201cSpirit\u201d video shot for The Lion King. It\u2019s back for Spring as a dress, top, and jumpsuit, and in new fabrications. Speaking of art, Kamali has updated her parachute coat with a metallic silver nylon that is almost as shiny as one of Jeff Koons\u2019s reflective pieces. We talk a lot in the office about adapting swimwear for city life. Kamali, who is noted for her skills in this area, makes it easy with bra tops and other convertible pieces (another signature).

This is especially the case as we eagerly await the Christmastime release of Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of Little Women, a film filled with the kind of soft floral frocks that have become so covetable in the last year or so. Zac Posen is excited about Little Women too, and he said as much during the preview for his Spring 2020 ZAC Zac Posen collection. As he lifted up the giant skirt of a glittery, strapless dress hanging in his showroom, he explained that these clothes weren\u2019t just Victorian, they were \u201cVictorian \u201980s.\u201d Posen pointed out that the eras were similar in the way that they embraced a bigger-is-better mentality towards fashion, favoring pouf sleeves, ball skirts, and rich, textured fabrics. \u201cVictorian \u201980s\u201d could describe much of what Posen has been doing in his main line for years, dressing women on the red carpet in vibrant hues, but always with a silhouette that hugs the waist and blossoms outward at the hips or shoulders. This lower-priced line felt more connected to his core label than usual because of the attention to volume and construction. The symbiosis was visible in the one-shoulder mini dress with grosgrain ribbon detailing and the vintage-inspired, A-line dress featuring a neon prairie floral print. At certain points in the collection, Posen did go deep into full-blown \u201980s with evening wear pieces like a tangerine mermaid gown with ruched balloon sleeves and a hot pink, 3D-lace cocktail dress. He\u2019s always been a designer with a charming, playful attitude towards his work, believing wholeheartedly that getting dressed in the morning or at night should be anything but middle-of-the-road. When so many others are going back to everyday wardrobe basics and uniforms, Posen has created a statement-making collection for women whose styles span from Alexis Carrington to Jo March."}, {"Designer": "Carolina Herrera", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "One look at the front row, where Vanessa Hudgens, Pose star Angel B. Curiel, and Valentina of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race were perched, and you\u2019d say that Wes Gordon is out to remake Carolina Herrera head to toe. In fact, though the guest list looked different than it did when the house founder was still installed, Gordon is faithful to Herrera\u2019s legacy. This season more than in the past, actually. The Herrera aesthetic is one part joie de vivre, another part propriety. In earlier collections, Gordon might\u2019ve leaned harder on the joy. Now that he\u2019s back on the runway for the third time, he\u2019s got a firmer handle on the famous Herrera decorum. That he managed to get this across while also setting a personal agenda\u2014to, as he said, \u201cpush myself on cut and construction\u201d\u2014takes confidence and finesse. Gordon set the show in a see-through tent among the Battery\u2019s 195,000 square feet of perennial gardens inspired, he said, by the California super bloom, which was so big this year, it could be seen from space. Fittingly, his first look paired a voluminous white shirt, the icon of the house, with a long skirt in an \u201cexploded\u201d chin\u00e9 floral print. There were more giant flowers where that came from, on a floor-grazing shirtdress and a short, flirty frock punctuated by a belt. Gordon\u2019s tailoring was similarly exuberant, having ditched the lean blazers of his previous outings for curvier jackets with full sleeves and backs that blousoned above generous bows. The energy dipped somewhat in the middle section of daytime separates in plaids and shirting stripes, but it zoomed back up again with black-and-white polka dots and more super blooms. Best in show was a little wisp of a thing worn by Adut Akech. Bright yellow, strapless, and aswirl to about the mid-thigh, it would indeed be a joy to wear."}, {"Designer": "Pyer Moss", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "It has been a year since Pyer Moss invited Fashion Week to Weeksville, the historic black neighborhood in Brooklyn. The second installment in \u201cAmerican, Also,\u201d a three-part series of collections addressing the erasure of African American narratives in popular culture, the moving show was hailed as one of the best of the season and positioned the brand squarely in the New York spotlight. So when designer Kerby Jean-Raymond decided to go on hiatus last season, shortly after winning the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund award, many wondered if he could keep the momentum going. With the Pyer Moss name in bright lights at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn last night, Jean-Raymond was ready to turn the volume up in a major way. The endless lines of people outside the venue\u2014a combination of industry insiders, celebrities, and those fans who were lucky enough to score one of 500 free tickets\u2014gave some indication of the scale and ambition of the project. Walking onto the scene, it was easy to imagine the production costs running well into the hundreds of thousands, which they did to the tune of around $400,000. Puzzled passersby on Flatbush Avenue all seemed to be asking themselves the same question: What kind of performer draws a sold-out crowd at this 3,000-person-capacity venue on a Sunday night? Entitled \u201cSister,\u201d the third and final chapter in the Pyer Moss trilogy paid homage to Sister Rosetta Tharpe. A singer-songwriter who rose to popularity in the 1930s and \u201940s, Tharpe is widely considered to be the godmother of rock and roll, though her legacy has been grossly diminished in music\u2019s history book. \u201cI think relatively few people know that the sound of rock and roll was invented by a queer black woman in a church,\u201d said Jean-Raymond backstage, moments after the show. \u201cI wanted to explore what that aesthetic might have looked like if her story would have been told.\u201d Beyond being places of worship, churches have long served as safe spaces for black communities across America, though you could just as easily add nightclubs and dance halls to that list. No matter what form it takes, the notion of creative refuge and freedom of expression has become more vital than ever for people of color in the tumult of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Delivered by writer Casey Gerald, who is known for his incisive social commentary, the sermon that opened the show was both uplifting and unapologetically political. \u201cFour hundred years have passed since they brought our people to this land . . . and I\u2019ve come here to say you can\u2019t hurt us no more,\u201d said Gerald in reference to the anniversary of slavery in America. \u201cThey knew that no matter how their master treated them, no matter how the world treated them, they had freedom on the inside that the world could not take away . . . . And we are here tonight to claim our wings.\u201d It was at that moment that the band and so-called Pyer Moss Tabernacle Drip Choir Drench in the Blood took center stage. Buoyed by their 70-plus ethereal voices, Jean-Raymond set forth his vision for rock-star style. As the first model bounded down the runway to the sound of Anita Baker\u2019s \u201cSweet Love,\u201d sporting rhinestone-studded wide-leg pants, a bolero jacket, and a halolike Afro, the staid rocker archetype\u2014skinny, white, male\u2014was instantly turned on its head. There were obvious nods to Tharpe\u2019s musicianship; the shape of her guitar was threaded through the curvy lapels of satin overcoats, and the most literal reference was a novelty guitar-shaped handbag. The subtle nods to her style resonated the most: a slightly monastic scarlet silk tunic layered over matching satin pants, for example. Tharpe wasn\u2019t the only prolific black songstress on the Pyer Moss mood board. Look closely at the chunky gold beads that were threaded onto braids and strung on statement necklaces, and you\u2019ll find they were brilliantly molded in the likeness of Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu. The rousing soundtrack included songs by several more legendary black female artists too, most notably Missy Elliott, who was recently honored for her phenomenal contribution to hip-hop with the prestigious Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards last month. After last season\u2019s partnership with Derrick Adams, Jean-Raymond sought out the talent of Richard Phillips, an artist who recently made headline news after he was exonerated after spending 45 years in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. His brightly colored figurative paintings lent a sense of exuberance to techy black track tops and oversize T-shirt dresses. Sean John was on the list of collaborators this season, as well, the last in a trio of black legacy brands Jean-Raymond has worked with for \u201cAmerican, Also,\u201d including FUBU and Cross Colours. With his new role as artistic director at Reebok, Jean-Raymond is adding another string to his bow. The clothing he showed as part of an ongoing collaboration with the sportswear label was his most confident capsule yet, and it included a chunky Pyer Moss\u2013ified version of the brand\u2019s classic shoe done in an array of eye-catching colors. Known as Reebok Studies, the new division he will oversee will act as an incubator for young talent, and it affords him the power to raise up a new generation of designers. \u201cI remember when Puffy won the CFDA Award,\u201d said Jean-Raymond, who was working at a sneaker shop just blocks from Kings Theatre at the time. \u201cAs a kid I never thought that I could get into fashion if I didn\u2019t learn to rap first.\u201d These days he doesn\u2019t second-guess himself, nor should he. He\u2019s living proof that marching to the beat of your own drummer pays off."}, {"Designer": "Collina Strada", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "As we approach the end of this decade, there is a lot to be angry about. People are pissed off, exhausted, and intensely nervous about what\u2019s next after so much of our country\u2019s dignity and integrity has completely gone up in flames. Collina Strada designer Hillary Taymour has felt the panic for some time now, but like the most anxious and sensitive among us, she has had a difficult time finding peace and sorting out the answers to the unknowns. Through her previous collections, Taymour has tried chakra balancing, meditation, and sound baths. Her designs have explored existential themes like self-love, self-preservation, and community healing. But beginning last season, she has focused her energy and her point of view on a much bigger crisis than that of, say, a barbaric, probably senile president. Taymour has always been passionate about sustainability and disturbed by the fact that the world is facing climate change. It\u2019s here, it\u2019s real, and as a designer, her vision for how to help\u2014how to try, however small the steps\u2014has crystallized after groping around in the dark for answers. Yesterday, she and her usual nonmodel cast of mothers young and old, LGBTQ+ friends, survivors, and small children gathered at a produce stand set up on the block that lines the west side of Stuyvesant Square Park. This was the set of her Spring 2020 runway show, and it drew a crowd that was probably triple the size of the attendees just two seasons ago. On each show seat, there was a reusable produce bag and a page explaining \u201cWays to Help Me.\u201d It read: Eat less meat. Eat more plants. Start a garden. Grow your own food. Cook at home. Plant a tree\u2014plant many trees, among other requests. The title of Taymour\u2019s show was Thank You Very Much for Helping Me, and it was a humble plea for all of us to be kinder to our world and to aid in patching up the daunting, dangerous holes we\u2019ve helped burn into it. Taymour\u2019s collection this season was also about love and creating a safe space for those of us, like her, who wake up every morning scared to death. What forest fires will we see on the news? How many more ice caps will melt? How poor will the air quality be today? Instead of these questions, Taymour prompted the show guests to ask simply: How can I help? As the singer Zsela began to serenade the audience, Taymour\u2019s support system of free spirits began to saunter slowly, purposefully down the tree-lined concrete runway. Some danced and chomped on apples they grabbed from the produce table; others tossed kale in the air. One woman carried a baby, and another dragged a wire shopping cart filled with discarded fabric behind her. Almost everything they wore was designed using upcycled fabric, and it was one of the most extensive and streamlined collections Taymour has ever produced: mashed-up pastel fabrics, soft painterly prints, and tie-dye turned slip dresses, skirts, jeans, tunics, and bodysuits into uniforms for the New Age, DIY-motivated flower children. She is dressing the hippies walking barefoot through the park today, in an era not dissimilar to that which caused a movement of free love back in the 1960s. On that quiet sidewalk near the urban green, it was an emotional, powerful thing to take in during a week when looking at clothes over and over again becomes a glaring reminder that the fashion industry\u2019s dirty secret is how incredibly wasteful it is. The show was certainly long, much longer than the editors and buyers seated front row probably anticipated. But who really cares? Taymour is in tune with the world and knows the importance of slowing down and seeking love and human connection as a solution\u2060\u2014love for one another, for ourselves, and, thereby, the planet on which we live and breathe every day. On the flip side, the designer is open and honest about the fact that her efforts are small and that she still has a way to go in figuring out how to make her burgeoning, CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund\u2013nominated brand 100 percent sustainable. As she pointed out in her show notes, the jersey pieces in the new collection are not repurposed from discarded fabric, and she and her team are \u201curgently seeking sustainable options. Thank you for helping me.\u201d Her collection was produced with gratitude and hope, which is as inspiring as it gets this week. As the last performer, Tei-Shi, finished her finale song and Taymour took her bow, the crowd jumped up and ran toward the produce table; grabbed loaves of bread, flowers, oranges, and greens; and stuffed them into the reusable bags that Taymour provided. If anyone thought the show was too lengthy, it didn\u2019t show. They sure were happy to stay and procure the local bounty. It must have been inspired by Taymour\u2019s plea and the flower children that she\u2019s outfitted for a peaceful, progressive new kind of fashion revolution."}, {"Designer": "Victor Glemaud", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Victor Glemaud often designs with a fabulous muse in mind; Indya Moore, Grace Jones, and Diana Ross have all populated his mood board in seasons past. For Spring 2020, however, the designer took a slightly different tack, paying homage to New York fashion legend Stephen Burrows. The reference was nicely aligned for several reasons\u2014firstly, for their shared color sense and the hip-swiveling, disco-inflected vibe of their clothes. As one of a handful of black designers working on the New York fashion scene at the time, Burrows broke boundaries in the same way Glemaud is doing now, a connection that isn\u2019t lost on either man. With the help of Bethann Hardison, who worked with Burrows back in the 1970s, Glemaud made contact with the 76-year-old designer. The conversations the two exchanged over email informed the collection Glemaud presented over champagne and cocktails at Spring Studios yesterday afternoon. \u201cHis point of view was fully formed straight out of the gate, and I think that\u2019s so important as a designer,\u201d said Glemaud. \u201cHe has a clear idea of what beauty looked like to him; everything came from this very instinctive place.\u201d You could trace Burrows\u2019s influence in the distinctive \u201clettuce\u201d hem that trimmed ruffles on a beige tube dress and charming shrunken cardigans. Images of the gorgeous Angolan model Maria Borges, who stars in the new look book shot by Richie Shazam, were blown up big and plastered on the walls of the space. The geometric patterns that took shape on slinky maxidresses and crewneck sweaters were a modern update on the graphic motifs Burrows was known for. Glemaud always manages to use print, pattern, and color placement to flattering effect with his knits. His beautiful mother floated around in a body-skimming beige T-shirt dress with graphic blue lines running along the sides. The standout piece spoke to a refreshingly inclusive, cross-generational spirit that Glemaud has been cultivating for his brand since the beginning."}, {"Designer": "Nicole Miller", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Nicole Miller made the most of her recent trip to Tokyo.

The habutai silk textures and shapes that nodded to the kimono reflected the inspiration, but it wasn\u2019t a straightforward homage. Miller thrives on assemblage\u2014mixing and matching patterns and references into flirty ready-to-wear. This time around, she added touches of \u201990s boho and French-girl chic into the mix. \u201cI realized how much I love Japanese art, but then I found these vintage Air France posters advertising [a trip from] Paris to Tokyo,\u201d explained Miller. \u201cI worked a little bit of the French influence in there too.\u201d After several seasons of youthful insouciance, Miller\u2019s girl hit a growth spurt. The standout pieces displayed sophistication. Sure, you could pair the georgette wrap dress on Pat Cleveland with a pair of Doc Martens and hit the club, but the piece was also fit for a grown-up date night. A series of patchwork dresses, some asymmetrical and covered in beading, others delicate slips, proved strong, as did kimono-inspired minidresses with billowing sleeves. The collection\u2019s maturity was reflected in its casting. The presence of veteran models Cleveland, Veronica Webb, Frederique van der Wal, Claudia Mason, and Patricia Vel\u00e1squez added a thrill for fashion nerds. For Miller, the presence of women she\u2019s known for decades, many of whom appeared on her earliest runways, brought the experience full circle. \u201cI have a personal connection with all of them,\u201d she said. \u201cPat Cleveland was the first model I met in New York when I was interning for Clovis Ruffin; Veronica walked my very first show. The entire collection is past and present brought together\u2014old meets new\u2014so it felt right.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Prabal Gurung", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Who gets to be American?

If, once upon a time, there was a concern that fashion and politics don\u2019t mix, it\u2019s been replaced by far more urgent worries. Gurung had plans to celebrate his 10th anniversary this season, christening the Vessel at Hudson Yard\u2019s with its first-ever fashion show.

Casual to formal, all of it was tinged with Gurung\u2019s trademark exuberance; there was zesty color, rose prints, feathers, and tie-dye to spare. He opened with a white dress whose rouleau button cut-out has become his most recognizable signature, and worked his way through denim dressed both up and down, pantsuits \u00e0 la Bill Blass (his alma mater), and menswear, a newish development for him, before getting to the heart of the matter: his cocktail and evening wear. It ranged from a befeathered le smoking to a rose strewn gown whose skirts swept the width of the runway. For the finale, the models emerged wearing silk sashes printed with the same question\u2014Who gets to be American?\u2014like contestants in the Miss America pageant.

He got to have an August vacation in Italy and Majorca, and he delivered a concise collection of evening looks that combined his signature precision with an appealing, rumpled\u2014yes, rumpled\u2014ease. Backstage Wu explained that most of the fabrics he used had been washed. The process cut the preciousness of silk habotai and other fine materials. In the silk habotai\u2019s case, it gave a slim sheath a crinkly quality, where washing the satine of a strapless hourglass in a pretty withered floral print by photographer Maxime Poiblanc produced more three-dimensionality. Even still, the silhouette here was romantic and willowy, close to the body with flashes of upper thigh. Suits played a secondary role, but they were likewise cut quite lean. Wu paired them with matching bra tops in the au courant style. The confident focus of the lineup was its strength. Specializing in something precise seems like the right thing to do in this moment of a rising consciousness about fashion\u2019s profligate waste. Wu definitely has an exacting approach, the intentional imperfections of this collection aside. One thing, though: In his absence, fashion has become a more inclusive place.

It mirrors Smilovic\u2019s approach to clothes: She tends to reject by-the-book retail rules in favor of instinctual design, often citing the women in her office as inspiration. Lately, they\u2019ve been searching for ways to balance bold, risk-taking fashion with serious ease and wearability\u2014the ultimate sweet spot. \u201cWe\u2019re always talking about how to make stuff that isn\u2019t average, but isn\u2019t so crazy that we don\u2019t feel like ourselves anymore,\u201d Smilovic explained.

Spring 2020 was partly about kind-of-strange styling: curved-shoulder blazers with slick nylon cargo pants; pinstriped suits with acid-wash T-shirts; satin trench coats with safari shorts.

(The opening blazer, for instance, is a no-brainer with jeans.) The bigger news here was in Smilovic\u2019s silhouettes. Many of the hard, boxy lines of past collections were softened, like the round shoulders of those blazers and the curved legs of many trousers. They weren\u2019t quite joggers, but they weren\u2019t harem pants, either; these had more structure and volume. The deep indigo tie-dyed pair will be hard to keep in stock. They\u2019re a welcome departure from the high-rise stovepipes and extreme flares of the past few years, and we\u2019ve already seen similar versions on other New York runways.

He\u2019s moved past this collage-like spirit, however, as evidenced in the much more streamlined collection he showed today at the Soho Grand Hotel.

He stumbled upon the rest of the raw material, such as overstock from eBay or a black fabric that looked like a mix of leather, latex, and silk that a member of his design team based in Italy sourced, claiming he works best in this sort of reactionary mode. Linder said he was thinking a lot about some of the old \u201990s runway shows, like those of Prada and Jil Sander, when simplifying his approach. \u201cWith Helmut Lang, he would send a guy down the runway in a pair of creased trousers and that\u2019s it, and with Prada, it\u2019s pared down so much that you have to look at the choices that were made on the detail level,\u201d he said. Linder\u2019s own choices, whether those unconventional scooped waistlines or a neckline that he pulled down a bit from the shoulder blade and curved, popped in the same manner. \u201cIf you really want to say we put thought into this, I think the simplified way makes more sense,\u201d he said."}, {"Designer": "Priscavera", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Prisca Franchetti\u2019s collections are not rocket science\u2014and thank heavens for it.

By really assessing her customer, Franchetti was able to expand her world into new arenas, like those corset tops that evoked Vivienne Westwood\u2019s sexy bustiers or a new swim line that turns her flame print into a covetable bikini bottom. Franchetti imbued a strong sense of herself into the collection too. Words from Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s Seven Deadly Sins painting were printed on denim and chiffon; well, actually the words are a misprint, a mistake Franchetti made years ago in a copy machine and saved for their graphic qualities.

Instead, designer Sander Lak offered embossed croc riding boots or saucy little kitten-heeled sandals with claw-like leather straps. Why the sea change? As Lak told it during a preview of his collection, he wanted to move away from his more idiosyncratic pieces and try out an earnest, pure, genuine beauty. This collection, then, was about clothes intended to radiate pure luxury: sort of Upper East Side by way of the Rive Gauche. Irony, Lak said, was in his past. But it was sort of ironic when Lak acknowledged that time was the greatest luxury, and he had little of it. Because of ready-to-wear production schedules\u2014and the fact that he just showed a menswear and see-now-buy-now collection in Paris this June\u2014Lak could not bring the couture standards he so wanted to his RTW collection. Instead, he had to be clever and find new ways to get the look of timelessness in, say, eight to 12 weeks. The result was quite a lot of subversion. His most compelling takes were his faux animal prints, made by embossing croc scales onto duchesse satin or printing snakeskin onto silk. Cut into trenches or wrap skirts, these fabrics could read a little stiff at times, but you have to give Lak credit for pushing the boundaries of his textiles and trying new things. Elsewhere, he draped denim into bias dresses, wrapped scarves around the body to make elegant tops, and paired cute square-neck, button-up tanks with pants like a modern millennial suit.

Unapologetic, determined, and slightly ruthless, it sums up the character and the LaQuan Smith woman. Never mind the fact that a male model was the one wearing the piece, Smith\u2019s vixen was front and center this season. From the moment Elsa Hosk stomped out in transparent, leopard-print latex, the crowd was on high alert.

Admittedly, clothes aren\u2019t the first thing that comes to mind when one remembers that film, but Smith isn\u2019t afraid to throw in a camp reference. Models wore ten-gallon hats by Eric Javits and Texas-size belt buckles with their short shorts and python-print pencil skirts. Rawhide leather jackets and denim shirts with built-in corsetry created in collaboration with Jordache added to the Americana theme. For all the cowboy swagger, Smith\u2019s standout moments came when he ventured into lingerie territory.

Understated and decidedly wearable, Choi\u2019s clothes answer the call of a practical working wardrobe. For Spring, the legendary photographer Deborah Turbeville and postmodern dance icon Trisha Brown were touch points for inspiration. The crisp cotton dresses with drawstring ruching added a nice fluidity to Choi\u2019s architectural aesthetic. There were new retro-style knit polos, too, a soft counterpoint to utilitarian cargo pants and Bermuda shorts.

Memories of his childhood in California and Mexico City informed the prints, with D\u00eda de Muertos skulls mingling with surfboards and many of the looks styled with crystal-bedazzled Teva sandals, including some of his fanciest gowns. (Does it get more SoCal than that?) Cohen is known almost exclusively as a dressmaker, but what stood out more than his familiar scarf-tied frocks and A-line minis was a single slinky, sky-blue jacquard suit. His eye for gorgeous fabrics translates nicely to tailoring, and in what will no doubt be a big season of tailoring, this one felt distinctly feminine; there was nothing \u201cmenswear-inspired\u201d about its design.

Yes, her sense of whimsy and craft\u2014almost unparalleled on the New York scene\u2014remains, but her garments were more traditional, finished, and formal than ever. The best pieces were upcycled trousers and color-blocked slip dresses, both commercially minded but not lacking in loveliness.

The time off actually got him thinking about the importance of pressing pause on the grind from time to time and taking a minute to recalibrate the mind and spirit. Standing in front of a mood board for the Spring 2020 collection of this little sister line, Wu did indeed seem refreshed and ready to showcase his thoughtful new work (and put on a Jason Wu Collection runway show again for the first time in a year and a half, this time inviting more than 60 percent customers). His new wrap dresses, safari jackets, and tailoring borrowed their palettes from Irving Penn\u2019s fruit photos and old travel posters promoting the French Riviera. Wu utilized beautiful pops of color and floral prints, both of which spoke to his original brand DNA more than any of his previous outings for this lower-priced label. In general, the clothes felt lighter and more playful. The next step for Wu will be to study the incoming generation of potential customers, the late millennials and Gen Zers who might have been too young to remember Michelle Obama wearing her Wu-designed inaugural dresses in 2009 and 2013, but who are currently driving the contemporary and high-contemporary markets across the globe. Wu\u2019s flair for 1940s and 1950s cuts and sophistication can remain, and his loyal customers will too, but he\u2019d be smart to tweak that aesthetic for younger women who want to look less sweet.

A super-charged birthday party for a brand whose mission inspires intense devotion, the show could have been a recap of previous hits, but McCharen-Tran was intent on innovation\u2014even if it meant looking to the stars. \u201cIt\u2019s about moving forward,\u201d she shared backstage.\u201dThe inspiration was very much about NASA and how its astronauts train in underwater facilities in Houston.

A celebration of collaborative art and womanhood, the collection\u2019s brightest moments came when McCharen-Tran shined her light on those around her, be they the mother-daughter pairings who walked the runway arm in arm or the entire behind-the-scenes Chromat team who came out to share the final bow. \u201cIt\u2019s always been important to us to make sure that people know that running a label isn\u2019t a one-person job,\u201d says McCharen-Tran. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to start crying at the end, but I felt so overwhelmed and grateful.

The designer has never really been on a board before, at least not like the guys in the park who are kick-flipping and 360-spinning on solid concrete just feet away from his home. Leba often talks about paying homage to a certain group of cool kids and recreating \u201ca vibe\u201d with his label R13. This season, the subculture on deck\u2060\u2014pun intended\u2060\u2014was that of a low-slung-Dickies-wearing skater kid. Leba was careful to expand on his ideas about what a hardcore skater looks like in the R13 world because he knows that skateboarders can be harsh critics against fashion designers (and anyone else) who appropriate their style. The Spring 2020 collection from R13, which mixed his men\u2019s and women\u2019s offering, did pay homage to the baby Tony Hawks who hang out by the ramps all day with details that included khaki-color pants that hung so low on the models\u2019 torsos, they revealed colorful boxer shorts underneath. Plaid shirts buttoned all the way up to the neck but left open at the navel, along with the flame-print bucket hats and jeans that were rolled up to board short length also fell into the skater category. Despite his best efforts, the references were, at times, too obvious. But Leba always puts his own R13 spin on whatever subculture it is that he is referencing, be they the British or New York punks, the Cali surfers, or Deadheads. This season, the brand\u2019s DNA came through with the leopard prints, the camo jackets, and the platform Vans-esque sneakers. It was in the denim of course, too, which is typically Leba\u2019s sweet spot from season to season. He keeps things consistent as far as his aesthetic is concerned, and really, he is in the business of making cool, elevated clothes for edgy dressers, not the masses. At today\u2019s show, a few NBA ballers and the rapper Offset sat front row, all wearing pieces from the new collection. They looked fantastic representing their own subcultural sets of basketball and music. Maybe the skaters across the street will embrace Leba\u2019s homage to them, too.

And for Getty, Bauhaus is a gift that keeps on giving\u2014anti-ornamental by instinct, and drawn to architectural forms and unexpected color combinations, its principles are easy ones for her to apply to her clothes; moreover, her relationship with the Getty Research Institute in California, which is now staging a retrospective of work from the Bauhaus school archives, gave her access to a treasure trove of graphic prints. Some of the most eye-catching looks in Getty\u2019s latest outing adapted those prints\u2014to wit, the natty double-breasted blazer and flared trouser set in a rust-toned optical pattern, and the scarf-print ensemble comprised of a handkerchief top and matching palazzo pants. Most of the looks here, though, were meant less to catch the eye than to wash over it. This was a determinedly breezy collection, dominated by a palette of sorbets and marked by super-lightweight fabrications like a waffled seersucker gingham, and silk and cotton voiles of exceptional diaphanousness. The sense of lightness extended to the shapes, with lots of the bias cuts, A-lines, and loosely wrapped looks that are a Getty stock-in-trade, as well as new balloon-like silhouettes and, in an unexpectedly feminine turn, architectural ruffles. The looks had an easy mien, but the details were telling\u2014the just-so placement of panels on a fine knit dress, for example, made the piece, while the fine sequins applied to a T-shirt gown gave off not so much a sparkle as an opalescent sheen. There was rigor to ground the breeziness, in other words\u2014another Bauhaus lesson well-learned."}, {"Designer": "Brandon Maxwell", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "For a designer best known for dazzling evening frocks, there was an awful lot of denim on Brandon Maxwell\u2019s runway this evening\u2014not to mention, a whole bunch of men. The introduction of menswear and the emphasis on daywear looks for the gals were two welcome surprises from Maxwell, who attributed the change-up to an upswing in mood: Last season, Maxwell noted, speaking backstage before the show, he\u2019d been reckoning with some personal hardships; this time around, as he began to brainstorm his new collection, he found himself brimming over with gratitude for the \u201cloving community\u201d that had shored him up during a hard time, and, in recompense, he found himself wanting to make garments they could relate to. This community included his fianc\u00e9, who had been requesting Brandon Maxwell menswear for a while, he said, and a troupe of girlfriends who wanted great-looking clothes for everyday life. \u2019Tis true that your average woman is more frequently in need of jeans than a broad-skirted ball gown. For the ladies, Maxwell\u2019s take on daywear amounted, in large part, to a country club\u2013ish take on model-off-duty style, with blazers thrown over skinny and slouchy jeans, and blouson button-downs in formal fabrics such as gazar paired with short skirts and miniskirts. For evening, Maxwell erred toward the bodycon, with lots of jersey dresses and slinky gowns with daring cutaways. Maxwell has some work to do with his jersey\u2014he\u2019s more experienced, and more deft, working with fabrics with a sense of structure that he can shape via his canny tailoring\u2014and some of the more skin-baring looks didn\u2019t quite come off, especially in comparison to the cool, confident sexiness of, say, a decidedly modest caftan-shaped shirtdress in lipstick red silk. Maxwell also has a learning curve ahead of him in the menswear department\u2014the individual pieces were all very dapper, and his tailoring talents didn\u2019t fail him, but the overall effect was a bit wishy-washy, with the most notable innovation seen in his choice of suiting palette\u2014red, lilac, and emerald. But as for the show as a whole, Maxwell got his point across: He wanted to celebrate the people he loves who love him, in the language of fashion, and this collection was chock-full of celebratory joie de vivre.

Brooding on this public/private divide, Moon Choi decided to make spies\u2014those professional masters of subterfuge\u2014the main characters and inspiration for her Spring 2020 lineup. Though there was the requisite trench (updated with volume and double collars), this was not a collection for wannabe Bond Girls or Inspector Clouseaus; Choi played strength off of lightness while moving forward from her preoccupation with breaking down the gender divide. Having explored that idea several times, the designer found that distinguishing between feminine and masculine was less interesting than a sort of \u201cthird type,\u201d by which she means a straightforward way to express identity apart from gender. This was, however, one of Choi\u2019s most feminine collections. There were feather-light knits, and the designer\u2019s romanticization of a spy escaping danger by parajumping resulted in some delicate and highly desirable parachute dresses. These, like many of her pieces, could be worn more than one way; in this case, they could be worn cape-backed or tied around the waist for a back-apron effect. Choi builds convertibility into her clothes by way of expert patternmaking and construction skills, but choices require confidence and daring on the part of the wearer. This gives her garments an inherent double life: one on the hanger, another on the body. Moreover, some options were more viable than others; where removable pockets added bulk here, an Oxford shirt with multiple button plackets that enables it to be worn straight or asymmetrically was spot-on. Known for her deconstructed tailoring, Choi\u2019s half jackets (the backs were mostly open) for Spring wrapped, hug-like, around the waist. They were particularly effective when their neatness topped fuller volume below. Small touches, such as a pant detail on a jacket, were whimsical; a dress with a cape back made to look like a garment bag required explanation. Though Choi is not a designer who talks much about herself, in some ways, her clothes are self-portraits. Asked how the spy theme related to her own life, she explained that the life of a designer often looks fancy because of shows and models, et cetera. The reality, though, is very different, especially for someone just starting out. \u201cI go home, and I work alone and really think about what I\u2019m doing and if I\u2019m doing it the right way,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I\u2019m still a young designer growing up, this [spy] lifestyle [read: having a dual identity\u2014public and private] also really connects with my own.\u201d It\u2019s the designer\u2019s ability to abstract aspects of herself into compelling designs that, in turn, connect with customers."}, {"Designer": "Bevza", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Much like the Khaite show this morning, Bevza drew a much bigger crowd than last season. There were more buyers and editors, and many, many influencers who have clearly fallen hard for Svitlana Bevza\u2019s austere brand of updated \u201990s minimalism. Her Kiev-based label has been in business for 13 years, but in 2019, Bevza got a major celebrity endorsement: In May, Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner wore one of the designer\u2019s white jumpsuits to wed Joe Jonas at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. On top of that, the clothes have wound up on Emily Ratajkowski and Gigi Hadid, among other models and glitterati types. But there is more to Bevza than her newly found mass appeal. Her designs are striking and deliberate, and they are meant to be \u201cinvestment pieces, worn over and over again,\u201d a shy Bevza said post-show. She considers the simplicity of her designs to be vital in helping women be more sustainable by buying things they\u2019ll keep and not throw away once a fad dies or a trend goes dark. This season, those pieces included a black silk skirt, clean white shirting, and a range of modest jackets and coats with an angular single collar that pointed upward to the face. Bevza also explained the meaning behind her streamlined, monochromatic black, white, and tan collection. In Ukraine, wheat fields symbolize womanhood and the designer represented this by adding subtle wheat braid tassels to a few of the garments. She also added them to mini pouches that tied around the waist and were placed purposefully in front of the models\u2019 crotches. The lovely finale dress, another slip, was decorated with the same braiding technique down the entire front. The dresses with paneling that looked like bodysuits unhooked at the bottom, perhaps nodding to this idea of liberated womanhood too, as did the bra tops and bra cutouts on two of the dresses. Though her collections do sometimes recall her predecessors who made naked dresses take off back in the \u201990s, Bevza showcased today, more than ever, that she has her own voice and distinct point-of-view.

This season, the designer met his match in Longshore, the New Orleans gallerist and painter whose contemporary take on the pop culture portrait has made her an art world star. Her work reimagines the powerful in neon and pastel, so naturally, Siriano requested that she capture some of his favorites in their element. \u201cI love her use of color and texture, that mix of playfulness and seriousness,\u201d he said of the oversize images of Laverne Cox, Lady Gaga, and Frida Kahlo that Longshore updated throughout the show. \u201cI think of her as a modern-day Warhol; it\u2019s so beautiful to watch artists paint, and they get inspired by designers as well, so I wanted us to feed off each other.\u201d The painterly motif worked well with a collection that concerned itself with hue and fabrication. Though there was a \u201csafe\u201d section of black separates and a slate gray eye print that appeared on several pieces, the bulk of the offering was vividly bright. Seafoam green metallic blazers, iridescent jackets with a duo-chrome effect, and hot pink minidresses all featured, but the rainbow lam\u00e9 stole the show. A balloon-sleeved number on model Maria Borges was a Technicolor dream coat worthy of a celebrity extrovert. 3-D touches like a textured lace designed to look like pursed lips continued the Pop Art theme, but the cinema wasn\u2019t far from Siriano\u2019s imagination. His most important season isn\u2019t Spring or Fall, it\u2019s the November to January film awards rush. Regardless of how one views his frills, in the context of the red carpet, they make perfect sense.

Maybe we should take it as a sign that our collective future is quite dark that Beckett Fogg and Piotrek Panszczyk decided to shine their light on the craftsmanship and couture shapes of the past so strongly this season.

Multiculturalism, inclusivity, and diversity are the core values of Area, notions they have translated on the runway since the start of their brand.

Backstage, Panszczyk acknowledged that black culture of the American \u201980s and \u201990s was an inspiration, with the goal of breaking down boundaries and unifying the idea of Area into something from everyone, for everyone.

O\u2019Neill also introduced new options for a bride\u2019s after-party dress, like a creamy satin mini with jeweled straps; more and more women are coming to Markarian for those \u201cadditional\u201d wedding looks, from the reception to the rehearsal dinner. For women who don\u2019t have weddings on the brain, Markarian\u2019s signature bustier gowns and ruffled midi-dresses in sumptuous brocades and printed silks will stand out more. (They also make great bridesmaid options!) This collection was largely inspired by its lookbook setting: an Italian villa O\u2019Neill had visited in the past. The wallpaper florals, warm palette, and elegant old-world silhouettes look perfectly at home in the opulent rooms, but it was more compelling to see them photographed outside in the grass or with the Tuscan sunset casting shadows across the silk. Those moments captured the contrast O\u2019Neill is aiming for: unabashed femininity, but with an unfussy, modern spirit."}, {"Designer": "Christopher John Rogers", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Last season, which was young Baton Rouge\u2013born, Brooklyn-based designer Christopher John Rogers\u2019s second, he proclaimed that he wanted to prove himself a serious contender in New York. At that time, his presentations gleefully showcased his whimsical take on eveningwear\u2014cascading tulle, slimming taffeta suits, pleated lilac skirts\u2014and people like Michelle Obama, Lizzo, and Tracee Ellis Ross took note, each wearing one of Rogers\u2019s pieces out in the world. He thereby proved himself serious enough to become one of the 2019 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalists. This only motivated him to buckle down further. \u201cAfter hearing the news [about the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund], I wanted to create the biggest splash that I could while addressing concerns about the clothes not being commercial enough or only being evening,\u201d Rogers said backstage after his show earlier today, just moments after the thunderous applause from the crowd at Spring Studios died down. The resulting collection spanned a wide range of Rogers\u2019s influences\u2014he referenced everything from Pierrots, the na\u00efve clowns of old cinema, to Paul Gauguin\u2019s paintings of Tahiti. Given the breadth of Rogers\u2019s obsessions, it\u2019s no wonder he rounded out 35 distinct looks. There wasn\u2019t a standout, mountainous tulle gown as Rogers has presented in the past (he mostly let that textile function as an accessory, wrapping long pieces of tulle around models\u2019 necks as one would a scarf). Instead, he delivered more readily wearable pieces that still expressed his signature sense of whimsy. In addition to sumptuous Italian silks, upholstered linens, and some deadstock fabrics that he fashioned into slouchy blazers, Rogers also incorporated elements of workwear this season, thereby skirting any sort of formalwear pigeonholing of his brand. Rogers offered up a refined use of the durable canvas that\u2019s traditionally used for tote bags by creating chic A-line skirts and streamlined work pants. He also dotted his collection with airy Swarovski crystal\u2013adorned silk button-down shirts and emerald green slips. True to his first collection, though, Rogers kept his sharp tailoring and vibrant use of color constant, and remained committed to dramatic silhouettes. The final garment was the most notable in that sense: a crystal-dotted, collared gown that most resembled a classic Pierrot\u2019s all-white collarette and exaggerated costuming (the crystals that neatly punctuated the design took 11 hours to press on). Rogers still works out of his small living room; he said that this season, friends and collaborators helped craft many of the pieces in their own homes. He\u2019s aware of the charmingly homespun appeal this lends his designs, but he\u2019s adamant that he wants a proper studio, and hopes to get stocked in stores after this collection. He envisions his customer as a savvy fashion person, one who\u2019s self-assured enough to understand that you can be multiple things at one time. By bringing his otherworldly, frothy vibe a bit down to earth, Rogers seems to have taken that idea to heart in his own work, too."}, {"Designer": "Ulla Johnson", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "It\u2019s only day two of New York Fashion Week but it\u2019s not too early to call it: Handcrafts are going to be a central theme of the season. The reasons are simple. Craft elevates clothes beyond the everyday, and we already have too many basics. Count up the T-shirts in your T-shirt drawer if you\u2019re a doubter. Also, craft is connected to culture and with President Trump trying to drive us all apart, celebrating our different cultures seems urgent and important. That\u2019s what Ulla Johnson was discussing backstage at her show today. \u201cI\u2019m the child of an immigrant. My mom came from the former Yugoslavia. I witnessed it fall apart in a violent way\u2014a country that was once a symbol of ethnic harmony. This show is a celebration of all that connects us.\u201d That\u2019s not just idle talk for Johnson. Her gauzy plaids were loomed in India, and the bags were hand-beaded in Africa, as were the recycled glass jewelry. On the runway, Dutch wax prints mingled with Japanese shibori techniques and dresses jingled with seashell embellishments. It was a lively collection, dense with pattern and, more so in the first half, zesty with color. What distinguished it from her previous outings was what Johnson described as its \u201cemboldened sensuality.\u201d There was more skin than usual, a development we\u2019ve seen taken to greater lengths on other runways in New York. The shorts and minis here looked youthful and fresh, but there was no shortage of midi-lengths either.

Hutson\u2019s excellent taste in \u201970s-era stars carries over into his tailoring. Each piece of a three-piece lightweight wool-cotton-linen blend Glen plaid suit was subtly dyed a different color, a creative detail. Just as interesting was a tie-dye-effect hand-painted pantsuit in shades of dark green and navy. He\u2019s got a great eye for fabrics. We also liked the look of a double-breasted suit in ultramarine that came with striking white buttons. Officially, this offering is unisex, but outside of the suits, Hutson\u2019s propositions leaned femme. He recut his shrunken camp shirts and high-waisted trousers in new colors and introduced some new shorty pajama sets. In a city where bra tops pass for outerwear, the pj\u2019s look street legal.

Spring 2020 added farming to their grab bag of ideas. Kim\u2019s sister built a scarecrow to replace the usual mannequin in their studio, and there were turned-over crates revealing rope sandals and fraying straw hats by Gigi Burris. If some of the label\u2019s past themes have felt arbitrary, there was a concrete starting point here, which was the setting of their lookbook shoot: Yoga Vida\u2019s new retreat center at a regenerative organic farm in upstate New York. It prompted Garcia and Kim to give their signature deconstruction an earthier touch: \u201cscarf dresses\u201d came in nubby striped cottons to mimic dish towels, and a few items came with built-in aprons or tool belts, including one stamped with \u201cFresh Oranges, Product of Monse, Spring 2020.\u201d More charming were the knits and jackets with \u201cseed packet\u201d embroideries or patches made in collaboration with the California company Renee\u2019s Garden. Mixed in with those cheeky details were Monse\u2019s signature scarf prints, this time with blown-up fruits, veggies, and gardening tools (in case you ever wanted a rake on your dress!). Silhouette-wise, the designers\u2019 usual slicing-and-dicing techniques produced some compelling new shapes: Blouses came with slits at the shoulder blades; jersey T-shirts had a single drape across the sleeve; wrap sweaters revealed panels of embroidery resembling pages from a gardening journal. It\u2019s possibly a blessing and a curse that this lineup is debuting amid conversations about health and wellness and the major talking point for Spring 2020: sustainability. Given the collection\u2019s natural roots, you\u2019d half-expect Garcia and Kim to focus more heavily on organic and recycled materials. Kim reported that their factories in Italy have gotten more serious about sustainability in the past year or so, but it\u2019s hardly a central theme in Monse\u2019s story. Now five years old, Monse is no longer in its infancy; to maintain its relevance and keep pushing boundaries in the next decade, it will be necessary to make sustainability a recurring theme."}, {"Designer": "Helmut Lang", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Not far from where Mark Thomas and Thomas Cawson staged their second runway show for Helmut Lang the brand today, an exhibition of Helmut Lang the man\u2019s latest artwork was opening. Lang walked away from his company 15 years ago, and in the interim, it\u2019s gone through its fair share of incarnations. Perhaps because of the significant amount of time that\u2019s passed or maybe because of the recent success of the reissue concept, Thomas and Cawson are taking a very faithful approach to their reimagining of this famous label. The reissue is a divisive concept. On the one hand, it\u2019s a clever way to address youthful FOMO, on the other, it\u2019s a design cop-out that doesn\u2019t push the conversation forward. The pros see smart money and the cons insist fashion must reflect the present situation or it risks becoming costume. As with so many things, there\u2019s a generational divide. The olds raise an eyebrow, but the youngs turn up in droves. Today, Jeremy O. Harris, Maisie Williams and her new boyfriend Reuben Selby, Charlie Plummer, Lucky Blue Smith, Selah Marley, and Paloma Elsesser all sat in the front row. Millennials, it would seem, are the target customers. But in fact, what Thomas and Cawson are up to looks good enough that the Helmut faithful might be intrigued. Absent a few dresses that read too sweet, this was an accurate accounting of Lang\u2019s signatures: the minimal tailoring, the utilitarian parkas, the sheer elements, the chromed leather, the touch of latex kink, the denim shapes. Reproducing the electricity of anticipation that used to course through Lang\u2019s show spaces is a much harder trick to pull off. And it\u2019s probably not fair to ask it of Thomas and Cawson. Lang was an original."}, {"Designer": "Rebecca de Ravenel", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "For Rebecca de Ravenel, earrings are never optional. Since launching her signature Les Bonbons clip-ons in 2015, she\u2019s introduced dresses and tops to wear with them, and she\u2019s constantly iterating on the concept. What began as three linear spheres wrapped in cord has evolved into candy-color hoops, swirly shells, and, for Spring 2020, frangipani flower earrings. De Ravenel drew her inspiration from Paul Gauguin\u2019s famous Tahiti paintings, which also informed the rich color palette of the clothes: hibiscus pink, deep saffron, emerald, and turquoise. On butterfly-print slips and minidresses, those colors looked especially lush in Portugal, where de Ravenel photographed the collection. But she\u2019s hoping the big takeaway is that the dresses seem like they\u2019ll be easy to wear, whether you\u2019re vacationing in Europe or headed to lunch in New York. She designed her twist on the breezy button-downs men typically wear in the Bahamas (she grew up between the Caribbean country and Paris), including the long, vine-print shirtdress that opened the lookbook. It had a sense of drama but looked quite low-key in person. With buttons all the way to the hem, you could unbutton it at the waist and wear it over jeans. Other dresses made a bolder statement, like a pink column with sizable puff sleeves. It had the flexibility women are craving right now: dress it up with heels and jewelry, or just wear it with flat sandals. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t shopping for just one occasion anymore,\u201d de Ravenel insisted. Her instinct to create wearable yet elegant day clothes was pretty spot-on\u2014it\u2019s hard to find a cotton sundress that\u2019s neither a beach cover-up nor unnecessarily complicated\u2014though the results don\u2019t quite comprise a full collection. Dresses and earrings are her thing, so maybe that\u2019s enough. Looking back at her past collections, this one occupied a nice middle ground between Fall 2019 and Spring 2018. If Spring skewed a bit too youthful with its cherry prints and flounces, and Fall was a bit too rarefied with its sequined black-tie gowns and floral silk caftans, she\u2019s striving for balance in 2020."}, {"Designer": "Kate Spade New York", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The theme of The Secret Garden, Frances Hodgson Burnett\u2019s 1911 novel, is rejuvenation, which was one of the undercurrents at Kate Spade New York\u2019s Spring 2020 show presented in Soho\u2019s charming Elizabeth Street Garden. In a collection statement, creative director Nicola Glass wrote of \u201cblossoming wherever you\u2019re planted,\u201d a lovely and hopeful thought at a time when there are few floating around. Glass\u2019s job is, after all, to rejuvenate this well-rooted American brand, which she describes as an \u201coptimistic\u201d one. It\u2019s also a brand that remains associated, to some extent, with its founder, Kate Spade, who died last year. \u201cWalking in this show is kind of a way to honor Kate, to keep her brand alive,\u201d said Debi Mazar pre-show. She stated that she\u2019s a big fan of Glass as well. The actress was one member of a diverse cast of personalities and models. The idea was that the customers would see themselves in the women walking\u2014and perhaps want to see themselves in the clothes as well. An accessory designer first, Glass\u2019s clothing designs, like a fit-and-flare wrap dress or an A-line jumper, are very straightforward and suitable to many women. The predominance of leafy prints and khaki for Spring can be explained by the show\u2019s stated theme, \u201curban safari.\u201d More appealing (and free from colonial undertones) were crocheted pieces and the recurrent uses of green which tied back to the idyllic setting. Oases like the one on Elizabeth Street are in short supply, and while you can\u2019t carry a garden in your pocket, you sure can grab a wicker bag\u2014or a roomy tote that, noted Glass, functions like a car or an office for the city dweller. It would be irresponsible not to mention the delightful mini \u201cRemedy\u201d number, a doctor\u2019s bag that came in solid colors or covered with spade-patterned crochet, like some of the garments in the show. While fitting in with the house\u2019s playful aesthetic, the elephant-shaped bags call to mind other models on the market.

He\u2019s in the process of installing himself and his team in the 33rd floor of a tower downtown, perched high above City Hall. He used the place to stage his first show. It\u2019s been stripped down to drywall, and just days ago, loose wires were dangling from the ceiling, but as usual, Lippes laid out the Sant Ambroeus treats and filled vases with fresh-cut flowers, in this case, luscious dahlias from his house in the Berkshires. He creates spaces that people feel good in, and the same goes for his clothes. Discussing the collection he said, \u201cI wanted joy, fun, and color.\u201d All three are very much in Lippes\u2019s repertoire, but he upped the ante here. \u201cWomen need a reason to buy,\u201d he said, \u201cthere has to be a spark.\u201d He went about lighting it by exploring mid-century couture volumes. Waterproof coats had trapeze swing, a shift dress worn with Bermuda shorts boasted a Watteau-ish back, and a citrine gown looked positively Crist\u00f3balian. Proudly noting that it was sewn here in New York, Lippes pointed out that the pleating detail at the bustline was created by twisting the fabric around matchsticks then tacking it down. Elsewhere, the ivory opera cape tied with a black satin bow had an irresistible flamboyance. His tailoring, by contrast, was more subdued, but the trim blazers and sunray pleat midi skirts looked particularly of the moment. Same with those aforementioned Bermuda shorts worn with voluminous tops. Lippes isn\u2019t a designer who bothers much with trends though. He\u2019s motivated more by his personal passions. Interiors are central among them. He hired the ceramicist Costanza Paravicini to paint this season\u2019s botanical print, which also appeared embroidered in translucent sequins on a floor-length white dress. Lots of sparks. He\u2019ll be retailing the shoes and boots, which he made in collaboration with Sergio Rossi."}, {"Designer": "Self-Portrait", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "If there\u2019s a mini-trend we can establish on day two of New York Fashion Week, it\u2019s a general loosening up of silhouettes. That may seem a relatively minor change compared to the bolder, flashier statements we\u2019ll see this month, but if even Self-Portrait\u2019s party girls are trading their nipped-waist minidresses and bustiers for A-line midis and gowns that fall straight from the shoulder, it\u2019s a significant adjustment. Designer Han Chong said he wanted his dresses to feel easier, freer, and simply more comfortable; as a result, there were more \u201cdaytime\u201d options than the going-out frocks and wedding guest dresses he\u2019s known for. He isn\u2019t one to sacrifice fun in the name of practicality, though. Chong\u2019s signature lace details were subtler here, appearing as yoke details on a shirtdress or along the bottom of a poplin blouse to reveal a flash of skin. In lieu of the \u201980s-ish puffed sleeves and corsets of past collections, he introduced empire-waist dresses and ruffled \u201cgoing out tops\u201d with square necklines, many of which had open backs and large bows tied at the shoulder blades. The major gowns in clean, almost monastic proportions we\u2019ve seen on top runways seem to have inspired Chong to make a few versions for his girls. Grace Bol\u2019s radiant fuchsia gown wasn\u2019t designed with fancy galas in mind, either; it would look more at home at an outdoor wedding or maybe even a party in downtown New York (with flats, not heels!). The finale gown, an orchid column in sheer lace, had a similar dress-up-or-down ease. It\u2019s worth noting that Chong avoided prints entirely this season, save for a few striped knit dresses; right now, an unfussy dress in a single bold color feels more modern than the clashing florals and checks of last Fall."}, {"Designer": "Khaite", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The line of editors, stylists, and buyers waiting to congratulate Catherine Holstein after her show today says a lot about Khaite\u2019s appeal. It isn\u2019t easy to get all of those people excited at once; the brands that succeed at retail are often met with a shrug by magazine editors, while the opposite is true for avant-garde designers, whose clothes look great in photos but have limited sales potential. Holstein has surreptitiously (or perhaps very intentionally) avoided being pigeonholed. The core of her business is jeans, shirting, and knits\u2014she likes to call them \u201ccherished items,\u201d not \u201cbasics\u201d\u2014but tweaks in proportion and fabrication keep things interesting. A prime example is the plush cashmere cardigan and matching bra Katie Holmes wore last week, which prompted a viral frenzy. (Needless to say, both items are now sold out on Khaite\u2019s website.) Holstein could probably keep growing her label with those kinds of luxe essentials, but she\u2019s got an experimental streak. Her first look for Spring 2020 registered as a genuine shock: a deconstructed suit, a long navel-baring blouse, and a rhinestone hairpiece. Things got slinkier from there: Chintz-printed sarongs, liquid-silk trousers, and harem pants replaced the structure we\u2019ve come to expect from Khaite, and handkerchief dresses nearly scraped the floor. \u201cI wanted it to feel more sensual,\u201d Holstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s a riskier take, especially for a line that\u2019s kind of synonymous with \u2018easy.\u2019 But there\u2019s a side of me that loves a sense of gaudiness and flash . . . I\u2019m so much more into that than a minimalist approach, so I want to start incorporating those aspects into my work.\u201d It\u2019s a bit of a pivot from the story of refined, timeless American style she\u2019s been telling for the past few years. But Spring\u2019s more idiosyncratic pieces and styling choices\u2014a pieced-together corset over a satin sarong, a peplum top ballooning over denim shorts\u2014will also place her more convincingly alongside New York\u2019s other emerging, boundary-pushing talents. It almost feels like a rejection of the uber-luxe, rarefied world Khaite has been edging towards; Holstein is exacting when it comes to quality and fit (with the price tags to match), but she wants every kind of woman to feel moved by Khaite\u2014not just the painfully chic, minimalist types. Americana is still her grounding force\u2014consider Spring\u2019s fringed suede jackets, blue jeans, and button-downs\u2014and the collection began with her childhood summers in Woodstock, Vermont. Her most treasured memories were there in her grandmother\u2019s home, where she recently returned for the first time in decades. The place was completely preserved with its late-\u201960s furnishings, and the experience was affecting; only after Holstein had designed the plaids and florals did she realize that she\u2019d been thinking about that house the whole time. (For the record, the rhinestone headpieces\u2014divisive among guests at the show\u2014were inspired by playing dress-up and wearing her grandmother\u2019s necklaces in her hair.) \u201cI wanted to evoke this sense of what it\u2019s like to be truly innocent\u2014before you\u2019re so bound by these ideas about your identity,\u201d she mused. \u201cI wanted to strip that all away.\u201d Let your freak flag fly! Holstein is still going to sell a lot of sweaters and jeans, but maybe that\u2019s her secret; while most designers start out with editorial, runway-worthy stuff and add commercial pieces later, she\u2019s kind of working backward. Three years in, she\u2019s established herself as a resource for the clothes women truly want to wear; now, she\u2019s giving herself room for a little audacity."}, {"Designer": "Sea", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Sean Monahan and Monica Paolini finished their Spring 2020 collection extra early this season so they could debut it at Copenhagen Fashion Week in August.

Lately, Monahan and Paolini have been steering their collections away from the bohemian prints and eyelets they\u2019ve long been associated with, ushering in a cleaner, more architectural look. Spring 2020\u2019s highlights included the hand-dyed, drop-waist slip dresses; patchworked and zippered jumpsuits; narrow cargo pants; and full, balloon-sleeved dresses with intricate embroidery.

Monahan and Paolini said the collection received such a strong response in Copenhagen that they\u2019re already planning to go back next season.

One standout jacket from 2016, hand-embroidered (the brand\u2019s signature) with different black women\u2019s hairstyles, took six months for Davis to create. At her New York Fashion Week debut last season, the star of a show was a blazer she transformed into a gown by fastening multiple other blazers around the waist. It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone other than, say, artist Kelsey Lu, who wore that very same garment to No Sesso\u2019s Spring 2020 show last night, pulling off the dramatic piece with such nonchalant ease. With her new collection, I\u2019d Rather Rescue Myself, Davis wanted to bridge the gap between her crafty designs, which can often be construed more as art objects, and a greater sense of everyday wearability. \u201cA lot of people ask about purchasing pieces, and we wanted to still keep our art concepts going\u2014hand-dyed fabrics, hand-drawn details, hand-embroidery\u2014but to make them a little bit more wearable for people to access and buy,\u201d Davis said following the show, outfitted in a bucket hat printed with the collection\u2019s foundational print: a superhero flying over the city with two girls sitting on her back, all of whom are black women. It\u2019s a drawing that only underlies the brand\u2019s community ethos\u2014Davis says she\u2019s most inspired by clothes that she\u2019d want to wear herself and pieces that would look good on her friends\u2014and it\u2019s one that she took from a T-shirt she saw while in Tokyo in March. She re-envisioned the original graphic, which had a white man as the superhero, as a version that better reflected her worldview. This more grounded approach, combined with No Sesso\u2019s cheeky \u201csilly and sexy\u201d Spring ethos, resulted in colorful airbrushed T-shirts that offered up a more refined take on the ones you might have found at a mall kiosk in the early 2000s, sumptuous tie-dye silk slip dresses and comfy, striped knit one-pieces. True to the brand\u2019s roots, some painstakingly embroidered garments dotted the collection, too, as did some unconventional and formally impressive techniques: All of the particularly thin knits that Davis showed were actually made from embroidery floss. Davis made history last season, becoming the very first openly trans woman to show at New York Fashion Week. True to her brand\u2019s message, though, Davis has only turned her focus outward, empowering others with her undeniably fun yet artful pieces\u2014just think of her as the woman in her drawing, a superhero flying with her Los Angeles cohorts riding high along with her. The brand\u2019s co-director, Arin Hayes, summed up this aspect of the collection well: \u201cIt\u2019s just about upholding each other and upholding yourself.\u201d Judging from the contagious vibrancy of this collection, they\u2019ll only have more No Sesso community members to come, which Davis seems to be ready for. \u201cWe want the entire world to know Sesso.\u201d"}, {"Designer": "Tomo Koizumi", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "\u201cI want to make something that is not commercial,\u201d said Tomo Koizumi before his Spring 2020 show.

As a display of fashion, it was breathtaking. Nicholson, the 18-year-old trans model and Raf Simons muse, projected well beyond a full painted face of glitter and a conehead \u2019do. As attendants dressed and undressed her in Koizumi\u2019s ombr\u00e9 ensembles, she oohed and aahed, trying to keep the audience enthralled. No disrespect to her performance, but the structure and fabrications of the garments were enough. All seven are made of hundreds of meters of ruffled Japanese polyester organza and utilize only one zipper. The construction is fascinating, with the ruffles backed by a cloth lining, suspended above each other like cascades of cake frosting. The silhouettes were pushed far beyond those of Koizumi\u2019s debut, with jumpsuits, bodysuits, and ballooning sleeves layered under scarves of ruffles and bows. The designer said he chose the bow motif because he wanted the collection to represent his gift back to the people who made him. \u201cI just want to bring joy,\u201d he said simply.

This year, they\u2019ve ventured into new categories like swimwear and shoes, they\u2019ve built out the brand\u2019s bag offering, and they are currently in the midst of opening stores all across the country. Denim will always be Frame\u2019s bread and butter, and it continues to be wildly covetable, but the ready-to-wear is now also selling out at a rapid pace, namely the leather and faux snakeskin trenchcoats beloved by those like Kaia Gerber and Kendall Jenner. For Spring 2020, Grede and Torstensson once again put out a collection of sharply cool jeans, tops, dresses, and outerwear that is all, very simply put, the most wearable stuff ever. That\u2019s their goal, after all, to give their fangirls and customers wardrobe staples that won\u2019t ever fall off the trend forecast and become irrelevant. Frame is about making fashion uncomplicated and timeless. They are also about sustainability. Torstensson explained during the presentation that he and Grede are taking steps towards reducing their carbon footprint in the industry, and this season, they showed two bomber jackets made from recycled materials. Also, their bag line now includes sportier nylon- and buckle-embellished totes designed with fabric made out of recycled plastic bottles. The majority of the furniture in their new stores will be crafted using recycled denim from their factories, and they\u2019ve come up with a denim spray so that you don\u2019t have to wash your jeans over and over again and leave behind water waste in the process. Like most massive fashion companies, Frame\u2019s initiatives are starting small, and the designers are honest about the fact that they are still figuring out how to churn out quality collections consistently while being mindful of their impact on the environment. Kudos to Grede and Torstensson for not speaking about sustainability like it\u2019s some marketing ploy, which frankly, so many brands are doing these days. They\u2019d be wise to make it an even bigger priority next season though, as they seem to have the means, the vision, and the business savvy to make a huge impact and to be a leader where fashion eco-consciousness is concerned."}, {"Designer": "Jeremy Scott", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Are you experiencing news fatigue?

Scott admitted as much himself, speaking before the show: With this collection, he said, he was out to \u201chave fun,\u201d and with that agenda in mind, he concocted what he described as a \u201cneon rock opera.\u201d A bit heavy metal, a bit rockabilly, a lot New Wave\u2014there was a strong whiff of \u201980s cult classic film Liquid Sky\u2014and extremely kitschy sci-fi, Scott\u2019s collection more or less dispensed with anything that might be humdrum about a garment and instead aimed to jam as much excitement into every item of clothing as humanly possible. There were zebra-stripe bouffant frocks in electric colors, psychedelic Hawaiian print menswear ensembles, color-spattered foil blazers and coats, metallic leather minidresses . . . The list goes on. Scott\u2019s farthest flights of fancy were either his hallucinogenic pieces with silver tubes twisting around them like snakes or others concocted from patchworked panties\u2014it just depends whether you prefer your fancy surreal or silly, take your pick. There was so much to look at here it was hard to parse. At a certain point, you stopped noting facts such as, say, that Scott was willy-nilly mashing up biker gear and Westernwear, and gave in to the endorphin rush he\u2019d set out to induce. What didn\u2019t escape notice, however, was the serious craftsmanship that went into these clothes, witnessed in everything from the curving trim on some of his eye-popping tailoring, to the chain-mail pieces that glittered like disco balls.

For Spring 2020\u2014the first season in which Rebecca Taylor wasn\u2019t present to discuss the collection, having left the brand in August\u2014the biggest surprise was the opening look: a vibrant indigo tie-dyed jumpsuit cinched at the waist with a D-ring belt. The trippy print appeared again on an army pant, styled with a flower-embroidered hoodie. That combo summed up the La Vie spirit pretty succinctly: a little feminine, a little masculine, and never try-hard. Dresses chez La Vie typically nail a similar sweet spot between wanderlust and wearability. The tiered-ruffle midi in a faded hydrangea print was spun in cotton, not silk, so you wouldn\u2019t think twice about wearing it with sneakers or stuffing it into your weekender. Another sleeveless dress in an \u201980s-ish rose print would be ideal for summer wedding guests, though women with a stacked 2020 social calendar will find more options in the main Rebecca Taylor line; La Vie is reserved for the pieces you can really live in, sans makeup or fuss."}, {"Designer": "Hellessy", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "This season, Hellessy designer Sylvie Millstein brought her muse Bianca Jagger to Buddakan.

The space is ornate and lavish, with a central gilded stairwell and images of Buddha next to rich tapestries. At least back in its heyday, it could\u2019ve been somewhere Jagger enjoyed a cocktail or two, wearing some fabulous flowing wrap dress. At Hellessy, Millstein likes to experiment with new shapes and silhouettes. This season, she added a built-in corset to crisp white shirting and trompe l\u2019oeil sleeves and scarves to tops. She also showed off-the-shoulder blouses and dresses, and there were pouf sleeves aplenty. Millstein has hit these points many times before though. The pieces that stood out were those that showcased her ability to evolve in a thoughtful, more subtle way, among them a draped orange peasant top and yellow boho skirt and an orange silk wrap dress with one shirt sleeve and one cape sleeve. Thanks to those pieces, Millstein\u2019s Spring collection was a little less angular and edgy than previous seasons and refreshingly so.

If you want the look of a worn-in, well-loved pair but aren\u2019t willing to dig through a thrift store, is there a designer jean that fits the bill? AG\u2019s Spring 2020 collection included a few compelling options. The best was a high-rise jean with pieced stitching, yoke-front detailing, and a high-contrast acid wash. There was a lot going on, though in person the wash looked a bit softer than in these photos. Serious denim heads will take issue with the tiny bit of stretch woven through the jeans, but AG\u2019s team insisted the heavier cotton they used will conceal their hidden comfort. Elsewhere, the standout pieces weren\u2019t jeans at all. Instead, they were fashion-leaning pants, like super-wide-leg khakis and pegged army pants. There was also a great double-slit midiskirt in cream denim. But the more important news was arguably the way it was all produced: Spring 2020 is the first AG collection made using new water filtration systems the company installed in its Los Angeles and Mexico Factories. The machines ensure that 100% of the water used is recycled rather than thrown out, which will reduce their water use overall and avoid the possibility of waste and chemicals making it into the waterways. The amount of water required to make a single pair of jeans\u2014from growing the cotton to dyeing them\u2014is significant, and it\u2019s given denim a pretty bad rap for the past few years.

Di Du, the Antwerp-based Chinese designer whose voluminous pastel creations are favorites of Gen-Z celebrities like Rosal\u00eda, had a strong showing with a sexy and subversively feminine series of body-con dresses.

She grew up in Palm Beach, Florida and has always had a great affection for the vibrant, color-strewn style of the residents between there and Miami. At the presentation for the new collection today in New York, Hansford spoke about Art Deco and a tangerine palette. She referenced the 1996 cult-classic comedy The Birdcage, which starred Nathan Lane as an aging drag queen and Robin Williams as his partner, who owned and operated the Miami drag club they lived above. Hansford and Corrigan\u2019s bright yellow-y orange, one-shoulder ribbed knit tank and deep orange, body-hugging skirt definitely gave off strong Miami vibes. So did the clever baby blue abstract wave print on a wrap tank and matching pant (it looked like a seat cover you might find at an \u201980s-era resort somewhere between South Beach and Palm Beach). The Simon Miller bestsellers were still part of this story, but it was refreshing for Hansford to put her own personal touch to this outing. It felt organic and playful, made even more natural by the fact that the designers cast street style star Courtney Trop to model the new collection in the lookbook. \u201cPeople want real, not necessarily editorial,\u201d Hansford said at the preview.

This season, the clothes were iterations on some of her classics: cropped and belted military trousers with angular cargo pockets, a zip-up romper, tailored blazers, and structured skirts and shorts with her signature high waist. The preppy button-down shirtdresses in creamy yellow and soft blue were the pieces that stood here this season, namely because they were less edgy and a little more in line with what she used to do as head of womenswear and accessories design at J.Crew.

As ever, the details provided the collection\u2019s sense of refinement\u2014in this instance, the specificity of Allegra\u2019s fits and the quality of her materials did a lot of the heavy lifting. A case in point: the drapey blazer in dirty pink micro-pleated rayon, which owed its femme-y vibe to its nicely narrowed shoulders and lean, sinuous line from armhole to hip. Elsewhere, Allegra had updated her trademark to jersey, switching from a blend to a more durable 100% cotton rib. There were a few innovations here\u2014the pops of orange, pink, and mint felt new, as did the workwear-inspired pieces, and Allegra\u2019s emphasis on concealed pockets (for phones, she explained) did not go unnoticed or unappreciated. That said, the big news coming out of this collection was the launch of a capsule collection of menswear. At an appointment this morning, Allegra allowed that guys have been wearing her garments for years, and thus, it wasn\u2019t much of a stretch to design clothes intended for them; as much as Allegra has never gone in for ultra-femininity or OTT sexiness, her new menswear is created for dudes at ease (that word again!) with their masculinity, their sexuality, and most importantly, their sensuality.

Despite the humdrum context, the pleasures inherent in the product were evident. As Weiland\u2019s rep mentioned then, and the designer later confirmed over a WhatsApp call, the collection\u2019s starting point was Dolly Parton. One country icon led to another, and thus a Roy Rogers-ish stylized cowboy accompanied by a Wonder Dog rechristened Pal also featured. Her broadly-brushed, kitschy Western theme gave Weiland rein to canter across a wide prairie of decorative reference. The house foundation faux fur coats came this time with horseshoe motifs or in leopard print with matching broad-brimmed hats, or in a Lassie western collage pattern. Bolo ties played against mismatched wash panel denim, and there was a super-cute section of pretty-pretty dresses and cropped pants in scarlet bandana print (also big in men\u2019s streetwear right now) that came, as many pieces did here, with pearly embellishments. Weiland spoke interestingly about her lack of affection for digital print and her keenness instead on pattern that has a \u201cpainterly\u201d feel. This was demonstrated in a seersucker attractively spackled with a green and brown floral that looked hand-drawn in marker pen. Around 50 percent of Shrimps\u2019s commercial catch comes thanks to its accessories, and there was an ample offer of cutely-detailed bags barnacled with pearly beading in country-touched designs.

New pieces like ombr\u00e9 separates and waxed trenches with matching bucket hats continued the shift.

I was able to bring that back into this collection.\u201d That idea came through in short-sleeve shirts with ties built into the collars and jackets with rounded cuffs. The borrowed-from-the-boys concept even got a little playful thanks to double-breasted blazers with a suspender strap extending from the lapel. Pieces that merged disparate ideas proved the most interesting. Noyes\u2019s belted blouses received an East-meets-West update via kimono-esque sashes and draping, while spartan T-shirt dresses got an outr\u00e9 touch of fringe.

Spring 2020 is no different. Every last texture has a tactile quality that has the designers more excited than the last. Micro-scuba, a fabric they continue to use for their mix and match tracksuits, paired nicely with an array of lightweight nylon designs that had a slippery and slinkier feel. While their forever-favorite velour was nowhere in sight, the pair put a focus on supersoft fleece for Spring instead, about as pared back as the two get, in head-to-toe looks that felt more authentically streetwear\u2014a new detail Nash-Taylor attributed to her own daughter. And those prints, all hand-drawn in their Hollywood offices, remained as energetic as ever. A bold pink lip print was a standout, as were snake block prints with hints of neon, a campy Hawaiian motif, and a blown-out sequin floral pattern in a muted digital print that turned a tracksuit into their version of a formal affair. Fitting for Nash-Taylor, the designer credits music as an ongoing influence in her designs and cited Lizzo as the embodiment of the sort of female empowerment Pam & Gela hopes to harness with its day-to-night looks, which just so happen to also incorporate Move Fast, its curated collection of four-way Lycra stretch workout essentials.

The big question here is whether the kind of Insta-babes that trade in daily mirror selfies will be wise enough to pick up on a brand that for a long time was associated with evening attire and the ladies who wear it. They\u2019d be wise to. In addition to expanding their ready-to-wear offering, the Ahluwalias have taken the larger issues affecting the fashion industry into consideration.

Their looks appeared timeworn, homespun, and earthy yet somehow also luxurious: linen pants and coats foiled in gold, suede coats or dresses dotted with raindrop crystals. Layers were their leitmotif; large vests and shabby sweaters were shown over worn-in shirts; dresses and tunic knits shifted open over body-skimming underpinnings. Tactile embellishments sprouted up everywhere: random embroidery strands, charms along back belts, sandal straps loaded with Western buckles. One jacket stood out for its allover cracked effect; in fact, it was a fil coupe overprinted as a trompe l\u2019oeil. Other trippy treatments included shirt pockets that became shadowy outlines, and bucket hats that had been sliced open and laced back together. For all this density of detail\u2014simultaneously intricate and unhinged\u2014these were still the same Acne girls who prefer extra-long sleeves and jeans, who give off that sense of alt-intellectual superiority. The printed pieces featuring Strindberg\u2019s paintings proved the standouts, in part because these wild, poetic scenes embodied the attitude of the collection.

The washed-out, muted tie-dye and blue-gray tones were statement-making for their sense of skyward calm.

One crispy nylon olive trench with a perforated orange lining stood out especially to this browser, but from the technical-twisted slides and bags made of shining malleable jersey under aluminum under vinyl to the chopped-up check dad-gone-mad jacketing and spliced-up trousers, there was lots here to dig into. For the women's spring collection, mumsy prettiness rather than dusty dadness was the grain sent through Abe\u2019s creative mill before being baked into fresh shapes. These included a fine long handkerchief-print silk dress iced with a narrow belt and melded to a gold-threaded knit, a loose black mesh top above a skirt in clever croc-pattern-pressed red nylon, and a many-patched dress whose skirt was a shimmering skein of metallic finished check.

Breaking from the usual preshow Q&A, a press text substituted for face time with Lim and Leon. It noted how the collections drew inspiration from the female free divers in Japan known as ama (as an aside, the Korean equivalent of these fisherwomen, haenyeo, informed the current Off-White Resort collection). The designers evoked these \u201clast mermaids\u201d through all manners of marine reference: neoprene suiting; diving gear reimagined as outerwear; sailor collars on jackets; filmy fabrics in underwater hues; shirts patterned with shrimp or else a jacquard of woodblock-style mermaids; fishnet sleeves dotted with pearls; color-blocked scuba-style sandals; and dressy pieces dripping with aquatic embellishments. Most of the looks will be fun to wear, with only a few outliers drifting toward camp. But hey, isn\u2019t that au courant these days? In any case, when Solange Knowles appeared as the halftime entertainment, her voice echoed through the space as though we were all underwater. T.S. Eliot once wrote of mermaids singing, a sublime moment marred by melancholy.

The idea is that during Resort, buyers tend to have larger budgets and more flexibility, but it also gives the Gordon sisters time to design larger collections more thoughtfully. In tandem with that change, their focus has shifted to retail\u2019s sweet spot: interesting, un-boring, but still wearable clothes.

The wrap-around blazers were shown knotted or loose and untied, a pleated skirt was layered over tapered trousers (a lingering old-C\u00e9line influence), and whisper-sheer lace dresses were slipped under hardier ones. What made it all look easy were the intentionally loose\u2014but not oversize\u2014silhouettes; Chloe said she wanted to move away from hard lines and restrictive waists.

Police in action are a common enough sight on the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es, what with it being one of the regularly chosen sites for the Gilets Jaunes weekend anti-government rioting. But no. This wasn\u2019t the weekend; it was the opening of the Vetements takeover of the capital\u2019s biggest McDonald\u2019s branch. But a shock, nevertheless\u2014especially because the models appeared through the front door, from a truck parked on the street. Demna Gvasalia is playing dangerously close to the narrow distinction between dystopian satire and reality this season. The \u201cmenu\u201d for the fashion sitting was stamped in black on McDonald\u2019s napkins. Kapitalism and Global Mind Fuck were two of the \u201ccourses.\u201d Later on the word Bose, with (Angry in German) as a translation. Messing with corporate logos and the signifiers of generic clothing have always been central to Vetements\u2019s methods. It plays ever more directly now into the agenda of critiquing the crumbling social decay of late-stage capitalism\u2014a direction Raf Simons seemed to be pointing toward in his menswear show, as well. With Vetements, fingers of sarcastic blame are liberally jabbed at corporate managers and bankers, at populism, the internet, at the tide of waste caused by the fashion industry\u2019s relentlessly profit-driven overproduction. A scary character walking in with the \u201cpolice\u201d was wearing a shirt, a tie stamped with a Global Mind Fuck logo, a conference sticker reading \u201cHello I am Capitalism,\u201d and a MAGA cap. Wait, no, a red baseball cap with For Rent embroidered on it. Rent? Large For Rent signs appeared on the backs of jackets, too. What did that signify? All the things you can imagine when you see it, about the desperation of a generation willing to do anything to get paid or the hollowed-out husks of men with no moral scruples about moving capital around. Along the way, the root of all evil itself popped up, too, stamped on T-shirts in the form of dollar bills with redesigned text that read: \u201cI Am the Piece of Paper That Controls Your Entire Life.\u201d Gvasalia had explained earlier that the uniforms were based on Russian policewear. \u201cI love uniforms. We wanted to design a Vetements uniform and kind of try to meme it into fashion.\u201d Well, is mimicking the guises of a system\u2014with a few savage twists and puns\u2014a way of getting under its skin? Gvasalia remembers turning up at an event as a student, \u201csomething I knew [I] had no real hope of getting into,\u201d but he was wearing a piece of a secondhand uniform, and found people stepping aside to wave him in. \u201cBecause they assumed I was a security guard.\u201d That\u2019s amusing. But can Gvasalia have it both ways: participating in the novelty-driven production cycle of the fashion industry, while criticizing it? At the beginning of Vetements, the idea of using the preexisting led to recycling jeans, cutting pieces from many sources into one. That\u2019s still going on at Vetements, by the look of it. Plus the mounded-up print collaged dresses\u2014another Gvasalia signature\u2014really are made from leftover Vetements fabrics.

In a way, there was a form of circularity going on here at McDonald\u2019s. A very personal one, linking Gvasalia back to his childhood. \u201cWhen the Soviet Union ended in Georgia when we were kids, the first thing to open that came from the West was McDonald\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like the maker of capitalism, and all the rich people from all around would bring their kids for birthday parties.

Like many a fledgling brand this week, Our Legacy took advantage of men\u2019s fashion week to display its burgeoning women\u2019s line. \u201cBorrowed\u201d shirts with summer stripes riffed on the men\u2019s collection; it\u2019s easy to see why they are already the category\u2019s bestseller. Our Legacy was one of the chunky sneaker pioneers. In that spirit, it offers dusty pastel renditions of a shoe that, by comparison, is one of the most discreet such options out there."}, {"Designer": "Ami", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "When a crowd of hundreds gathers and quietly swelters waiting for a show in the Grand Palais on a June afternoon, you get the sense a designer has something up his sleeve. Which, in fact, Alexandre Mattiussi does. He sports on his forearm a tattoo of a Roman numeral \u2014 IX. Nine. It\u2019s his lucky number. It so happens the numerology is working in his favor. The designer has moved into his ninth year as a Parisian indie. Today, June 18th , marked his 18th show, which squares nicely. And, conveniently enough, the French word for \u201cnine\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d is one and the same. One cycle ends, another begins. Mattiussi champions fashion with a sense of humility. Back in the day, he resigned from a major fashion house and struck out on his own because he could not square with designing men\u2019s wear that was too far removed from real world dressing. ANDAM Prize in hand, he staked out a place in men\u2019s ready-to-wear with AMI. Elevated basics like easy overcoats and cropped carrot pants were just edgy enough for a broad Parisian base. It made a whole lot of sense. Women were known to adopt the outerwear, and style icons like Caroline de Maigret walked in his shows (she sat front row wearing a caramel AMI ensemble tonight). For years, the designer\u2019s women friends needled him to branch out. \u201cI always wanted to be a small house with a lot of humility,\u201d the designer said this evening. Today, he chose to push AMI into new, slightly darker and moodier territory, complete with a full-fledged women\u2019s category\u2014without blurring gender lines. In a crisp palette of black, white, beige, and poppy red with the occasional shot of fuchsia, Mattiussi stepped neatly into a space that, bizarrely, has sat relatively unoccupied in the Parisian landscape for years, ever since a few international behemoths (and a smattering of niche brands) got big enough to lose the plot. \u201cSuddenly Next Summer,\u201d as the collection was called, sticks with Parisian essentials. A sharp trench with a wide belt (one of them in black leather). A cropped jacket, also with a wide belt. A mean pair of trousers. A sharp sleeveless coat. A black and white check jacket. The meditation bells on a coat or shoes may not be for everyone, but they speak to the designer\u2019s sense of staying centered. \u201cI wanted to do pretty and sophisticated ready-to-wear,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people are cool; I wanted to show something more of Paris.\u201d That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean starting a revolution. But for savvy dressers everywhere, AMI is now officially a French brand to be reckoned with."}, {"Designer": "Dsquared2", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "The ebullient Caten twins\u2019 quicksilver energy was apparent in tonight\u2019s fast-paced show, where a fire-red light bathed the showspace, crossed by a lacquered glossy catwalk. The setting suggested not only an obvious Chinese inspiration, which was reflected in the collection, but also an intensity and a combative attitude, expressed in the press notes\u2019 headline: #RED2 Warriors In A Summer Garden. Bruce Lee was also in a sort of metaphysical attendance, like a spirit animal hovering over the collection; at an earlier preview, the twins sported identical (obviously) T-shirts printed with an image of the most influential martial-artist of all time, worn with the same chinos with printed satin boxers peeking up from the waistline\u2014a look replicated throughout the co-ed show. \u201cHe bridged the gap between the East and the West, between the \u201970s and the \u201980s he was a true pop culture icon,\u201d said Dean\u2014or it was Dan? It\u2019s difficult to extricate their tightly intertwined sentences. Asked why China was so prominently referenced in the show, they fired back: \u201cBecause it\u2019s sexy! And there\u2019s something rich about it.\u201d No arguing with that. The Catens\u2019 take on Chinese iconography and shapes had the sexy edge one expects from a label with a taste for bold provocation, but it wasn\u2019t served in a predictably overt way. \u201cNo, no, no! We do not like to be predictable!\u201d they exclaimed in unison. And actually, they riffed convincingly on the rich, sumptuous, decorative side of Asian iconography, filtered through an \u201980s lens and given a brash, cheeky twist. Chinese-inspired traditional motifs of paper animals, tiger-striped camouflage, peacocks, and lucky-charm monkeys were used. Humongous chrysanthemums were blown up and shot with bright colors, printed on shimmering gold lam\u00e9 or on a black background of silk satin or intarsia leather. The opulence was further amped up in a floor-sweeping padded and patchworked silk kimono, a statement piece which prompted a Wow! exclamation, worn with tight distressed jeans, a Bruce Lee-printed T-shirt, and impossibly high, laced-up fire-red stilettos\u2014an otherwise endangered species on global catwalks. Gold leather reigned supreme, a standout being a corseted and laced-up leather jumpsuit with \u201980s cropped harem pants, inducing a sharp intake of breath from the DSquared2-clad starlets crowding the front row. Another entrance-making number was a floor-sweeping chiffon gown, with undulating pliss\u00e9 ruffles in printed patchworked silk, with an embroidered neckline hanging by thin shoulder straps and worn over a tank top. Compared to the lavishness exuded by the women\u2019s collection, menswear looked almost restrained. \u201cShe takes a lot of space!\u201d explained the designers. \u201cShe demands! She wears the pants!\u201d Men\u2019s silhouettes were leaner than the women\u2019s, elongated in black leather ensembles with a punky vibe and metallic toys, paired with see-through tank tops and shirts. The bold Asian-inspired motifs and tiger-printed lam\u00e9 ran through both collections: for guys they decorated boxy hoodies paired with roomy shorts, printed short-sleeved shirts, or slim bomber jackets worn with dark denim pants. On a rarer note, a padded black silk kimono embroidered with peonies and chrysanthemums, worn with matching slim cropped pants, had the same decorative edge displayed on the women\u2019s looks, even if it never reached the same self-confident boldness. It might be a sign of the times."}, {"Designer": "Neil Barrett", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "\u201cThe collection has respect for tradition and heritage,\u201d said Neil Barrett backstage before his show. \u201cBut at the same time it has a break-the-rules kind of attitude.\u201d Known for his sharp, inventive tailoring, mostly in black and white, today\u2019s show felt like the designer celebrating a more youthful spirit and a more diverse, energetic and exploratory approach. Case in point was the showspace, usually stark and minimal. This season Barrett worked with South African artist-in-residence Jody Paulsen creating compelling visuals covering the entirety of the glossy floor, inducing an immersive, almost trippy feel. Paulsen also worked with the designer on creating artworks. A kind of new heraldry and fictional \u2018Old Boy\u2019 crest decorated garments, echoing college scarves, conveying a youthful spirit slashed with a streety vibe. Boxy tops and cropped shorts punctuated the collection, counterbalanced by the play on hybrids, which are one of Barrett\u2019s distinctive style traits. Finely executed and displaying the designer\u2019s skilled tailoring technique and inventive repertoire, they were the collection\u2019s strongest point. Raincoats were mixed with hunting jackets; bombers were blended with truck tops; sweatshirts joined with leather jackets in new imaginative shapes. Even the shoes were given a hybridized treatment, with a new sneaker fusing skateboard and basketball styles and mismatched colors. The show finale embraced the uplifting mood, with a futuristic ghetto blaster incorporated into a sleek black backpack. \u201cYou can carry it around and have a full, major party anytime, anywhere,\u201d enthused Barrett."}, {"Designer": "Narciso Rodriguez", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Discussing his new collection, Narciso Rodriguez said, \u201cthe work becomes the decorative element.\u201d His idea for Spring was to expose the construction details of his meticulously made clothes on the outside of the garments. He called it, \u201cgoing back to the drawing board.\u201d As instincts go, it was quite telling. Clicking through the collections this season, a pattern emerges: There\u2019s a lot of ornament for ornamentation sake. At some labels\u2014not all\u2014it begins to look like the quest for something new produced a result that\u2019s merely extra, not an improvement on what came before. Overcomplicated is another way to put it. And now that our excesses are coming back to haunt us in the form of global warming, well, one can appreciate Rodriguez\u2019s efforts to streamline. In practice, this meant that the geometric seaming details of his sheaths were piped in contrast colors; ditto for the shirtdresses with contrast top stitching. As decorative elements go, they were subtle in the extreme. The other conceits he worked with this season were draping and knotting; these produced the collection\u2019s more sensual pieces, not least of all because, as he explained, he was using haute couture techniques, only without the stiff, old-fashioned undergirding. Of course, without the undergirding, they\u2019ll be more demanding to wear for non-supermodel bodies. There was also a white cotton sundress splashed with a watercolor floral arrangement at the midriff that was lovely for its simplicity."}, {"Designer": "Jeffrey Dodd", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "In an industry saturated with designers, how does a small local name like Jeffrey Dodd make his mark? Dodd may have found his answer by moving from his early days of mainly event dressing to more of a full day-to-day wardrobe, and by leaning into his roots. Dodd\u2019s collections have traces of an elevated Southwest and Midwest feel\u2014Dodd himself is from Iowa, and seems to design most earnestly when he is pulling from those regions. This outing was mostly inspired by his time spent at artist Jun Kaneko\u2019s studio in Omaha, where he also exhibited his work and was surrounded by the artist\u2019s huge, unglazed sculptures. Something that Dodd excels at is his use of leather. One of the best examples of Dodd's handiwork was a brutal but elegant dress that had squares of black leather bar tacked together so that when the model walked, the dress revealed thin slices of white in between the slits. The white and black leather bags were also a hit: Tubular pieces with a fat grommet in the middle\u2014a new label signature\u2014appeared as if they could function as a self-defense weapon. More importantly, these bags felt like an It classic that could look even better with time."}, {"Designer": "Monique Lhuillier", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Once again, Monique Lhuillier is skipping the hassle of pre-collections and splitting her massive Spring lineup into two separate drops. The strategy works particularly well for the prolific designer, who will be opening a new two-story flagship in New York City this fall. Lhuillier explained, \u201cWe have a lot of racks to fill!\u201d Spring 2020 began with the Italian style icon Marella Agnelli. \u201cIt has an Italian, \u201970s, glamorous vibe to everything,\u201d she said. \u201cMustards, flowy chiffons, endless trains, and lots of movement.\u201d Lhuillier\u2019s choice of muse led her to shoot the lookbook on a stately villa in Lake Como one week ago. As always, there were frothy tulle confections, voluminous taffeta ball skirts, and elaborately beaded gowns that had been custom-dyed in a pretty range of pastels. Of note, however, was the surprisingly minimal thread that Lhuillier had woven throughout the collection, including monochrome tunics and smocked long-sleeve gowns more subtly printed with lam\u00e9. \u201cThe non-beaded pieces are new for me,\u201d she said, pointing out a white turtleneck jumpsuit with wide palazzo pants, decorated sparingly with a silver beaded belt. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of simplicity coming back.\u201d It felt like a nice change of pace and a smart way for Lhuillier to diversify her output. Those racks won\u2019t fill themselves."}, {"Designer": "Ji Oh", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "When Ji Oh started contemplating her Spring 2020 collection, she began Googling collage artists, eventually zeroing in on one who used images of people riding dinosaurs. The oddball motif was exactly what Oh had been hoping for, since she set out to design fresh, playful garments, some of which were more humorous and ironic than her previous outings. Over the course of her young, still burgeoning career, Oh has pretty much stayed on the same course and focused on her tailoring techniques, reworking classic shirting and dress silhouettes with asymmetric cuts, textured fabrications and the option of customization (a top or skirt that can be worn various ways depending on how it\u2019s tied or buttoned, for example). In recent seasons Oh has branched out a bit with check patterns and pops of colors, but rarely has she used a proper print, let alone a kooky one. It was nice to see Oh get a little less serious with her work, because she is light and fun in her everyday demeanor. The dino print might have been a little much if we\u2019re talking about the selling power of this collection, but Oh deserves props for going out on a limb. She also experimented a bit more with denim this season, which was a winning exercise for her. The denim corset dress, oversize shirt, and hybrid skirt that looked as though a shirt tail was hanging from the bottom, all made from upcycled men\u2019s jeans, deserve high marks. The check-print pieces were cool, too, but mainly because of their fit and the way Oh implemented her masterful use of deconstruction. If she experiments further in the coming seasons, maybe a print doesn\u2019t have to be the main idea. Denim seems to be where she is thriving and having the most fun, and here\u2019s hoping there is more to come down the line."}, {"Designer": "Alexander Wang", "Season": "Spring", "Year": "2020", "Text": "Calvin, Ralph, Donna. If you came up at a certain moment, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, and Donna Karan were the holy trinity, bigger than life icons who defined American fashion in the late 20th century. At 35, Alexander Wang is just barely old enough to have witnessed their glory days firsthand (only Lauren is still taking runway bows), but Wang wanted to pay them homage anyway. \u201cWhat got me here... who were the pioneers who paved the way for me... American fashion and being born in America has influenced me so much. Not just the brands, but what they stood for: strong, unapologetic women.\u201d The designer\u2019s Rockefeller Center show\u2014the first ever held at the venue, he proudly noted, and a spot extremely well-suited for the kind of public-facing event he\u2019s tried to pull off in the past\u2014was divided into sections. Donna Karan got the Wang treatment to start. Decades after she did them, her bold shoulders and no-fuss stretch jersey bodysuits still signal power\u2014a testament to how groundbreaking her early collections were. Logo tees, denim in \u201990s-ish light blue washes, and underwear as outerwear were the Calvin Klein codes Wang picked up on. Of the trinity, Wang\u2019s chilled-out, sexy aesthetic is most closely aligned with Klein\u2019s, only here a shy Pete Davidson of Saturday Night Live fame stood in for Marky Mark, and did a rather irresistible job of it. Ralph Lauren-isms like flannel plaid, mile-long suede fringe, and wide-wale corduroy are rare sights on a Wang runway. That might be why the Lauren section proved the most compelling; change trumps continuity, and the cut of the corduroy blazers was good. The fourth part of the show was all white and heavily logo\u2019d. It could\u2019ve been mistaken for an ode to Tommy Hilfiger, a designer who would\u2019ve liked to make the trinity a quaternity, but Wang said it was a tribute to suffragettes, who often wore the color. There\u2019s no escaping the sense that the United States are in jeopardy in 2019, so it wasn\u2019t hard to appreciate the sentiment of solidarity Wang seemed eager to convey with his multiracial casting and straightforward referencing of American fashion greats, even if this kind of overt lifting wouldn\u2019t have flied in Calvin, Ralph, and Donna\u2019s heyday. Wang brought his mom and dad out for a bow at the end of the show, and underneath them the LED runway was striped red and white like Old Glory. Fashion plays out on a much bigger stage than it did 35 years ago. Wang understands that and he\u2019s quite agile at its entertainment aspect. Yes, this was theater, but it was a feel-good moment nonetheless, fusing family and patriotism. We don\u2019t get many of those these days."}]
